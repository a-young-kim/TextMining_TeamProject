66003,even with the size chart is off.,66003,4
66003,I wish they had it one size larger.,66003,4

66007,Love it but should have ordered a small rather than medium.,66007,4
66007,If you are slim and tall it will still look great with heels :) I am 5'8 and 145 lb,66007,4
66008,They are your standard Vans Slip on shoes.,66008,4
66008,"They run in the same sizes as my Converse, so they fit well.",66008,4
66008,"I tried a pair on in the stores thinking I would wear a 7.5 as that is what I would wear in my tennis shoes, but that was a bit too big and a 6.5 was just too small.",66008,4
66008,The 7 that I got fit perfectly.,66008,4
66008,My left shoe has something like a flaw where the ball of my foot touches when I step down.,66008,4
66008,"It's not like that in the right, so I am assuming it's just a small flaw, but it's not a big deal.",66008,4
66008,I am sure over time I won't eel this anymore.,66008,4
66008,"Like Converse, I cannot wear shoes like this for too long.",66008,4

66009,It actually measured in at a 5.5.,66009,4
66009,"I will say even after having it resized it is still a bit  big
on my finger.",66009,4
66009,The band is slim and the stone large which causes it to flop from side to side.,66009,4
66009,I will have to have a ring sizer placed on the bottom of the band if I want it to sit upright without moving.,66009,4
66009,"So, in the end although the price for the ring is good with all the added money that I have spent
to get it to look the way I want it is a bit more than what I had intended to pay for a costume piece.",66009,4

does better on someone with a more average sized hand/finger, I still like the ring and really have no regrets with the purchase.",66009,4

66014,I got sooo many compliments on this dress!,66014,4
66014,"It is pretty short, so if you are taller you may want to take that into consideration, or you may be wearing it as a shirt.",66014,4
66014,"I am 5'4"" and I think if I was any taller I may have not been able to wear this.",66014,4

66017,I like this a lot!,66017,4
66017,The bottom part and the straps look great-but the top was wayyy too small.,66017,4
66017,I usually wear a 6-8 so I got a medium I ended up switching out the top part (it slides out) and slid in a bando black top :) But I do like it a lot  !,66017,4
66018,"The top is a little odd, but not too bad.",66018,4

66029,This Bodysocks - Inflatable Ride Me Unicorn is super cute.,66029,4
66029,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the fan to inflate the costume is in kind of a weird place where it keeps getting blocked by my leg.,66029,4
66029,I like the band it back of the hat that helps it stay on.,66029,4
66030,"Bag looks just like in the picture, and appears to be of good enough quality for the price, bought it for my girlfriend, who seems to like it too.",66030,4

66032,"When I workout, I usually run and I have to put on 2 of these bras, but, I guess that's the plague of having huge boobs.",66032,4
66032,I have yet to find a sports bra that gives me the hold and support that I need when running with just one bra.,66032,4
66032,"But, at least with these bras, like I said before, they're so comfortable, EVEN with 2 of them on!",66032,4
66032,"I love the zipper because I hate having to pull a bra over my head, and it makes it easier to take them on and off when I'm wet or sweaty, which is a plus.",66032,4
66033,"Good clarity, low internal reflection.",66033,4
66033,Tint is not nearly as dark as factory lenses though; in open water or on snow you may still feel some minor discomfort from reflected sunlight.,66033,4

66039,"Go a size larger than you'd expect, it'll work for a night though.",66039,4
66039,"Customer service was very good, had to return the costume since the zipper opened up on the back and it wasn't even all that tight, ended up pulling out the stitching since the zipper broke and couldn't get the zipper down.",66039,4
66039,Confident in doing business with them in the future since the return wasn't a hassle.,66039,4

66043,She likes that it is very loose and comfortable to wear but nice enough to wear to work and still be dresses appropriately.,66043,4
66043,Teachers need to be comfortable and professional at the same time.,66043,4

66044,"I got the necklace, and by itself it's pretty good quality, but when I wear it at school and I lean down to do work or something and I sit back up it often gets caught in the desk, and breaking the chain, off the chain, etc.",66044,4

66057,"As Grillardin in a commercial kitchen, I'm hoping the extra length provides better spatter protection than the ""shorties"" we're given to use.",66057,4

Cons:
1.",66107,4
66107,My nipple bars before were long.,66107,4
66107,Which I'm used to.,66107,4
66107,"If you have large nipples I advise you NOT to buy these, due to the fact they most likely won't fit.",66107,4
66107,"I had slight trouble getting em on myself, and it took me a few days to get used to the look of such a small piece of jewelry on my nipples
2.",66107,4
66107,After finally getting them on my one nipple was sore for a day.,66107,4
66107,"That could just be my experience due to irritation of trying to get em on

So, so far I think they're great even if they're small.",66107,4
66107,"But as I read, some have gone bad due to them being ""fake jewelry"".",66107,4
66107,"In my personal experiences, ALL jewelry I have bought on amazon (which is A LOT) has never went ""bad"".",66107,4
66107,So I don't assume these will.,66107,4
66107,"With that being said, if they do start to go bad, I will be back to warn you.",66107,4
66107,"If they dont, this will be my only review lol

66114,"Very nice beach dress however, I ordered a 2xl after already ordering a xl and it still fits a lil snug in the breast area.",66114,4
66114,My breast aren't that big that it should never be able to comfortably fit a size 2xl especially considering that my overall size is a lg xl.,66114,4
66114,I love the style & look of the dress just couldn't fit it.,66114,4
66115,"If you buy one size larger than normal, you'll love the fit and comfort.",66115,4
66115,"Incredibly comfortable, just snug enough.",66115,4
66115,"The fabric is great, and the designs are fun.",66115,4
66116,"I put these in each pair of shoes that I wear, both tennis shoes and dress shoes.",66116,4
66117,"I liked, but ran a little smaller than expected.",66117,4
66118,It fit nicely !,66118,4
66119,I features I like are that it's lightweight and that you can pack it into its own pocket to make it easier to transport.,66119,4
66120,It's a nice hat and fit well.,66120,4
66120,It also folds up.,66120,4
66120,Would be great for packing.,66120,4
66120,"However, it was too much with my flowered dress.",66120,4
66121,It was a good deal!,66121,4
66121,Just dnt have a lot of Wat I'm looking for in my size,66121,4
66122,"The green ones leave a green color on my lobes, not a big deal bit kind of concerning.",66122,4
66123,I only gave four cause the word aberration is cut off on the bottom!,66123,4
66124,Length is a little long but very comfortable and cute!,66124,4
66125,The packing box was ridiculously large for the cigarette holder but the holder itself is great!,66125,4
66126,Cute and comfy leggings.,66126,4
66126,"When you put them on, they feel like tshirt material.",66126,4
66126,These showed up more quickly than I expected.,66126,4
66126,I followed the advice of other reviewers and bought a size bigger.,66126,4
66126,"However, I find that they run true to size so mine are loose and baggy.",66126,4
66126,I was pretty disappointed but to ship them back is more than what I paid for them originally.,66126,4
66126,I may buy another pair in the correct size and gift these to someone else.,66126,4
66127,I had to have surgery on my shoulder and needed some large button up tops...these were the only thing I could find...I had to order 2 XL in order to get what I needed...will probably pass them to someone else who needs tops...I can't  use the bottoms at all.,66127,4
66129,Shipped from overseas so they took a long time to arrive and then stuck to high heaven when they arrived.,66129,4
66129,Decent for the cost but the smell tells me that they aren't safe to use a lot.,66129,4
66130,"A little stretch to it, makes it comfortable and able to move with you.",66130,4
66131,"These are very trendy, I love them.",66131,4
66131,They're the perfect size for my slim face..,66131,4
66131,I wouldn't reccomend for rounder faces.,66131,4
66131,"Although, the female pictured wearing these, hers looked much more rose gold rather than pink.. Unfortunatly, in person, they are much more pink than I expected.",66131,4
66131,"They are somewhat flimsy, yet, still durable and hold their shape.",66131,4
66131,"Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.",66131,4
66132,I really like the cut and fit a lot.,66132,4
66132,It looks just as pictured.,66132,4
66132,"I am not a fan of the material, though.",66132,4
66132,"It's not particularly comfortable, and it doesn't really breathe.",66132,4
66133,"Fits great, and as expected!",66133,4
66134,it take a while to receive them they fit as i was expected i love them i would buy this product again,66134,4
66135,You get what you see.,66135,4
66135,Well besides the tights.,66135,4
66135,"The tights are like stockings and they were to small for me (I got a 3x-4x), mask was to big but I have another one laying around.",66135,4
66135,"The diamonds came off so I had to sew them on, the skirt is to short, and the top shows a lot of cleavage (I have a huge chest), but its cute and it fits :) the arm warmers are perfect and comfy, and the choker is amazing.",66135,4
66136,Good sunhat for toddler.,66136,4
66136,The hat ties under the neck and has adjustable tie at the base of the head which makes it stay on the head.,66136,4
66136,Used this with a swim bodysuit and swim shoes for amazing protection.,66136,4
66136,Con: the brim is pretty long for sun protection but can make it hard for a smaller toddler to see and the side of the face is left unprotected depending on the angle of the sun.,66136,4
66138,Very cool but detaches very easily.,66138,4
66139,I'm a size 4 and it was a bit too snug.,66139,4
66139,I purchased a medium.,66139,4
66139,I will order a large because I loved it so much.,66139,4
66140,The company went above and beyond to replace/refund me for a damaged item,66140,4
66142,Perfect for the upcoming summer,66142,4
66143,Very best Price Quslity,66143,4
66144,Used them at my wedding for myself and all guys in the wedding.,66144,4
66144,The cufflinks themselves are really good quality.,66144,4
66144,The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the box (while looking really cool) doesn't have a lid that will stay on.,66144,4
66144,"To fix this, I just wrapped a bow around the box which worked really well.",66144,4
66145,The top fit very oddly (lots of extra fabric in rear) and was a little itchy.,66145,4
66145,The arm bands were ridiculous and would only fit someone with wrists like the Hulk.,66145,4
66145,"Otherwise, for it's purposes as a one time only costume, it was fine and fit my family theme.",66145,4
66146,This is my favorite bikini set!,66146,4
66146,The actual bikini is pretty similar to the one in the picture.,66146,4
66146,It runs a little larger than I had hoped because I read a review that stated it ran small.,66146,4
66146,I would recommend ordering your actual size.,66146,4
66146,The back of the top does not have a clasp and cannot be opened or closed.,66146,4
66146,"The back of the bottoms have complete coverage and are thin, but not see through.",66146,4
66146,"The shipping took a few weeks, but it was worth it.",66146,4
66146,The only other thing I would consider a negative is that it doesn't have too much elasticity.,66146,4
66146,"The top ripped slightly on the corner when I was putting it on, but it's nothing a little light sewing can't fix.",66146,4
66147,Super soft and comfortable.,66147,4
66147,"When purchasing this robe, it is important to realize that it is made to be comfortable and not super sexy.",66147,4
66147,Over all beautiful; not too small and not to big.,66147,4
66147,"I'm 5'7"" at 120lb and it fits me perfectly.",66147,4
66149,Ordered to match my rose gold / silver / black watch and jewelry.,66149,4
66149,Am only wearing the three rings that match this color scheme.,66149,4
66149,"They look great and have held up to a few weeks of daily wear without noticeable scratches, dulling nor tarnishing.",66149,4
66149,"The three stars rating, is because I measured my ring finger and then ordered the size 8, per the chart.",66149,4
66149,Yet the size 8 rings turned out to be way too big for my ring finger.,66149,4
66149,"Am having to wear them on my middle finger, even though they are a tad loose on that finger, also.",66149,4
66149,"Had they conformed to the sizing chart, I would've given them the higher rating.",66149,4
66149,"This said, the extra space has allowed me to ""link"" the rings together as a precaution against the ""pinching"" reported by a few other reviewers, via adhering a thin, black plastic band along the inside of the rings.",66149,4
66150,Lighter than I thought it would be.,66150,4
66151,Great value for a VV tie.,66151,4
66151,"Wish it came tied, for gift giving / presentation purposes (and I don't know how to tie a bow tie).",66151,4
66151,"It's a legit bow tie, though, not a clip on.",66151,4
66152,"Very cute, love the design.",66152,4
66152,I'm a curvy girl so it was a little small in the buttocks region but still cute.,66152,4
66154,Thin but that's to be expected.,66154,4
66154,Perfect for indoors or warm weather .,66154,4
66154,They are very cute!,66154,4
66156,My son loves these shoes for baseball..,66156,4
66157,I am obsessed with this top.,66157,4
66157,I have received a ton of compliments from it already.,66157,4
66157,It's nice to wear over the spring and summer.,66157,4
66157,It's a little see-through so you might want to wear a tan bra underneath.,66157,4
66157,The only thing I disliked was the lose threads in the inside.,66157,4
66157,"However, it is worth every penny!",66157,4
66158,Company positive to deal with,66158,4
66159,Really pretty cover up.,66159,4
66159,The only downside is that the tassels at the bottom aren't secure so they will eventually fall off.,66159,4
66159,I only noticed this because a few of them were on the floor.,66159,4
66159,"To solve this, I simply knotted each group of tassels.",66159,4
66159,"Other than that, love it!",66159,4
66160,Good rain jacket for travel.,66160,4
66160,"It would be nice it it had a dedicated pocket for self-stowing, and the hood makes side-view a bit difficult.",66160,4
66160,"The blue color I chose was discounted, but looks fine.",66160,4
66161,"It's roomy, it looks good (a little too good, but I'll fix that.",66161,4
66161,"Only gave 4 stars because I'm not 100% sure that the strap is real leather, but it's leather enough for my purpose.",66161,4
66161,"If you are going to use this as a costume piece, make sure you get it in enough time to weather it a bit!",66161,4
66162,I bought this product for my one year old son and he absolutely loves it.,66162,4
66162,The grip on the bottom is helpful when he's running around the house so he doesn't fall.,66162,4
66162,The design is adorable and he's face lit up as soon as he saw the shoes.,66162,4
66162,I would recommend this product(:,66162,4
66163,The suede tends to look dirty - as if there's dust/dirt coated over them.,66163,4
66163,"They're a dusty black color, in other words.",66163,4
66163,They fit true to size.,66163,4
66164,ordered one size larger fits great.,66164,4
66164,Time will tell about the endurance but very nice so far.,66164,4
66165,So I got a medium and I'm 5'6 145 and everything fit good except for the legs.,66165,4
66165,They were a little tight but nothing horrible.,66165,4
66165,Didn't cut off circulation or anything.,66165,4
66165,Gotta get used to bring squeezed but I like it.,66165,4
66165,The before and after picture is all the proof u need.,66165,4
66165,Just get the right size!,66165,4
66166,very pretty and well made BUT they do run small.,66166,4
66166,"If you wear a large, probably go at least 2 sizes up.",66166,4
66167,"Nice fit, good tummy control and but lift.",66167,4
66167,Wires hurt a bit though when sitting down,66167,4
66168,Great color and lots of storage pockets and slots.,66168,4
66168,The wallet was a little longer than I expected but holds all my stuff nicely.,66168,4
66169,This product is great for the lazy dresser like myself.,66169,4
66169,It definitely has a loose fit which is what I was going for.,66169,4
66169,I ordered the mossy green shirt dress and it's true to color in the photo.,66169,4
66169,I've thrown it in the washer and dryer twice now and there was no shrinkage and it's still as soft as when I got it in the mail.,66169,4
66169,"The length is perfect as it hits my mid thigh and I am about 5'7"".",66169,4
66170,Very sheer as stated in other reviews and the quality is as expected for the price!,66170,4
66171,"Not quite the beanie I wanted--pops up off the top of the head, but warm as hell",66171,4
66172,I love it is very good.,66172,4
66172,I wear it every day.,66172,4
66173,Exactly like it is pictured.,66173,4
66173,This is not a real stone though.,66173,4
66173,"It is more of a plastic resin, as Opalite is not a real stone (Google it).",66173,4
66173,BUT it is very lovely on.,66173,4
66173,"The chain I was sent is a bit different, more of a flat chain, and I actually like it better than the one in the picture.",66173,4
66173,"This ""stone"" is actually pretty cool.",66173,4
66173,I notice it picks up what ever color you are wearing.,66173,4
66173,"So it is more blue if you are wearing blue, more pink if you are wearing pink.",66173,4
66173,Which is a fun trait for it to have.,66173,4
66173,I think it is fairly good quality for the price and would suggest to other buyers.,66173,4
66174,Would have been 5 stars if the neck hole wasn't super tiny.,66174,4
66174,The photo is awesome though.,66174,4
66174,Hope my son can get his head through it.,66174,4
66175,"If you have a bigger behind, it will not cover.",66175,4
66175,I'm not sure if that's clear or not.,66175,4
66176,"IT IS A NICE TEE, VERY WELL MADE, All my T's have to be a bit larger because I am upfront - you know the rest of the story.",66176,4
66176,"Nice color too,  I will again order this T in different color.",66176,4
66177,"Super cute, casual earrings, they were smaller than expected however everything else was great!",66177,4
66177,"Came on time in a little earring box with as small bag of earring backs, there was no chance of them smashing in the mail.",66177,4
66177,"They do bend easily but real silver, no reaction in my ears even though I wear them everyday!",66177,4
66178,Shorts are a little big but still cute and wearable.,66178,4
66178,My daughter absolutely loved the mustache.,66178,4
66180,Nice shirt but be warned it runs large and think on top.,66180,4
66181,I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday.,66181,4
66181,"He's nearing 30 and loves anything comic related, so this ended up being a good choice.",66181,4
66181,"It still looks ""grown up"" because the outside is just black leather.",66181,4
66181,The comics are on the inside.,66181,4
66181,It's a really nice looking wallet.,66181,4
66181,"Like other reviewers, he did mention it's a bit bigger than he is used to, but he got used to it pretty quickly.",66181,4
66181,"One star off for the size, but other than that it was a great gift.",66181,4
66182,Good for the money.,66182,4
66182,Used on weekends only for about 6months.,66182,4
66182,Holding up where I need it to..,66182,4
66184,They can see through it and cover their shoulders.,66184,4
66184,Keeps the wind off as well as the rain.,66184,4
66185,A little small bit I love the print,66185,4
66186,"It looks like the picture, my little sister likes it.",66186,4
66187,I got this as a gift for a child in need for a charitable giving tree gift over the holidays and I was delighted when it arrived.,66187,4
66187,"She loves Cinderella and her favorite color is purple, so this couldn't have been more perfect for her.",66187,4
66187,"It's not the fanciest of necklaces by adult standards by any means, but for this young girl, it was absolutely perfect.",66187,4
66188,For some of us women we ordered this swimsuit because it can cover stretch marks and is sexy without showing too much of the wrong stuff... and it is everything I thought it would be...,66188,4
66188,However..... it does not come with instructions on how to wrap the top...the description says you can wrap it five but i can only figuire out how to wrap it the way in the pic and it doesnt wrap all the way back around like the model i had to tie it in the front... im sure there is a blog or youtube video that i can refer too... overall I am extremely happy with my buy!!,66188,4
66188,also even tho I was not due to receive it until 6/25 i got it  on 6/7 plenty of time for my bday celebration and gave me a little extra motivation to stick to my diet!!,66188,4
66189,I fell in love with this dress as soon as I saw it.,66189,4
66189,"I went by the sizing chart from Grace Karin and it was a tad too large, but the dress is built for that to be okay.",66189,4
66189,"Instead of the belt that came with it I used a 7/8"" grosgrain ribbon and cinched it nice & tight.",66189,4
66189,"The material is stretchy enough that the next dress like this I buy (and there will be one, or two), I will probably order a medium.",66189,4
66189,Works with both white or black crinolines.,66189,4
66190,Very cute and comfortable.,66190,4
66190,I like the soft material.,66190,4
66190,It doesn't look like the photo amazon has.,66190,4
66190,"The pink is a light neon, it's a thinner and stretchier material than what it appears in the photo, and the grays aren't as dark.",66190,4
66190,I still like this cardigan very much.,66190,4
66191,Feels substantial (weight/feel) and it operates well.,66191,4
66191,"Good idea, and good execution.",66191,4
66191,And it helps your FICO (credit score) by disposing of active cards!,66191,4
66191,I believe it is worth trying.,66191,4
66192,I ordered a size up because I'm a bigger girl and usually Amazon sizes run small.,66192,4
66192,Well this product does not.,66192,4
66192,It's made really well and it stretches slightly so it has a lot of give to it.,66192,4
66192,"I'm 5'2"" and wear a size 18 in pants and a 40DD/42D in bra and have most of my weight in the tummy area.",66192,4
66192,"I ordered blue in a size US XXL/Tag XXXL and it was slightly too large (especially in the breast and butt areas) because again, I ordered a size up.",66192,4
66192,So I'm going to reorder in a US size XL because I love everything about this item!,66192,4
66192,DON'T ORDER A SIZE UP!,66192,4
66193,It does have a stretchable material cotton like so I kept it stretched it a little bit and love it,66193,4
66194,Seems to be well made.,66194,4
66194,A good value for the price.,66194,4
66194,Very comfortable and supportive.,66194,4
66194,A smaller size probably still would have fit.,66194,4
66194,"The only thing I didn't like was the tag on the back, but that is easily removed.",66194,4
66196,Beautiful but fits small.,66196,4
66197,Super simple but super comfortable and cute dress.,66197,4
66197,Fit me perfectly and it's great to wear either with flats or high heels.,66197,4
66198,These are really cute.,66198,4
66198,I bought them for use in the pool so I don't ruin my rx ones.,66198,4
66198,"They are plastic, and it's obvious they are not high quality however will work for what I need them for.",66198,4
66199,Very cute but it's very long !,66199,4
66200,"Normally wear a XL, had to exchange for an XXL.",66200,4

66203,It fit great I love it.,66203,4
66203,I'm 5'1 and 180 pounds and I got xxl it fit great.,66203,4
66203,It was a little small in chest year do I look out padding and it was fine.,66203,4
66206,they are comfortable and soft.,66206,4
66206,They do run just a bit larger than I thought.,66206,4
66207,"Product was great however, a couple of flowers came off during the shipping process...I just super glued them back on.",66207,4
66208,"Buy with caution for larger cup sizes (36D), gave me quadboob, even having sized up given Chinese sizing.",66208,4
66208,"I thought it might be tight across the chest, but was hopeful anyways.",66208,4
66208,"Gave this to a friend though, looks great on them!",66208,4
66209,Absolutely love how cute & cheap it is!,66209,4

66209,Comfy & I've gotten plenty of compliments.,66209,4

66212,I'm a 34B and a size 4 in jeans.,66212,4
66213,My daughter likes them because she is the only one that knows they are not real when she goes out.,66213,4
66214,"Very nicely designed shirt, soft fabric, pretty color.",66214,4

66214,"It looks on me just like the image, very snug.",66214,4
66215,"Pretty, I needed more room in bust area.",66215,4
66216,Very good value for 2 Nato bands.,66216,4
66216,The straps have stitched guide rings which is a must for these straps.,66216,4
66216,"The leather strap is adequate, but not that great looking.",66216,4
66216,You are better off choosing a pair of canvas straps and just order a leather strap from somewhere else if that's what you like.,66216,4
66216,Otherwise this is a no brainier for value.,66216,4
66216,The red/white/blue strap looks great on my Seiko Diver.,66216,4
66218,nice dress but the cloth is very thin.,66218,4
66219,A GIFT FOR MY SISTER IN LAW WHICH SHE LOVED,66219,4
66220,Material and quality is great as I would expect from Carhartt.,66220,4
66220,"However, I wear 34W 32L on all pants and these were small on the waist and long on the leg in a 34W 32L.",66220,4
66221,"Love the fabric, style and most of the fit.",66221,4
66221,But it's rather small in the shoulders and chest.,66221,4
66221,I also had to take about 4 inches off the bottom but I expected that so not a problem.,66221,4
66221,The green is more of a mossy green which is still nice.,66221,4
66221,"The problem, which I can fix using the fabric I removed for shortening, is that it fits tight through the chest and shoulders.",66221,4
66221,"I'm not a very big in stature, 157.48 cm, 54.4311k, I ordered a medium which would usually be too big.",66221,4
66222,I ordered this for a friend for her granddaughter....she said it arrived much faster then she expected for Christmas and she was thrilled.,66222,4
66222,It was very nice and for the price was absolutely perfect.,66222,4
66224,Comfortable and fits well.,66224,4
66224,Made of rayon so keep that in mind,66224,4
66225,We got the blue and pink.,66225,4
66225,We luckily did not make any people crayons after the halloween party,66225,4
66226,Would have like to see it in a larger size.,66226,4
66227,These are a little thicker than I had hoped for but they seem like fine socks.,66227,4
66228,Just a bit Small for a Medium size shirt,66228,4
66229,"Great colors,  Just too small for me.",66229,4
66230,"I got his for my 5 year old and, albeit, somewhat large for the size I thought I was getting,  it fits exactly like I wanted, for her.",66230,4
66230,Just like the kid in the photo.,66230,4
66230,The knitting is great quality and very soft.,66230,4
66230,Overall we love it.,66230,4
66231,This was bought for my sister's costume and fit the job perfectly.,66231,4
66232,The sizes was nice but the material seemed somewhat cheap.,66232,4
66235,defianately tights not leggings.... completely see through.,66235,4
66235,ended up wearing them with shorts but they still look amazong,66235,4
66236,I love this wallet.,66236,4
66236,Just the right size for me and my important things.,66236,4
66236,It did have a bit of a chemical smell (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) when I received it but 2 days and its gone.,66236,4
66236,I'm trusting the company that the RFID really works as I do not have a way to test it.,66236,4
66237,Order size up runs a little small.,66237,4
66237,Other than that great shirt.,66237,4
66238,"Just got yesterday,love it , looks exactly as the picture!",66238,4
66239,"Very warm, nice quality.",66239,4
66239,Does shrink a bit when washed and size 4 a little small for my (very tall) 3 yo.,66239,4
66240,"Style fit & material great, should have picked a better color though, the print is not that becoming.",66240,4
66240,Unfortunately the Royal was not available in an 8.,66240,4
66240,May try the purple instead.,66240,4
66241,"Nice looking, only wish was a little larger around neck...almost like a chocker.",66241,4
66242,"beautiful, but too small ...",66242,4
66242,Gave to a daughter.,66242,4
66243,Super comfy great for work!,66243,4
66244,THe dress was nice but you must be big busted for this to fit correctly.,66244,4
66245,Nice loose feel as boxers should feel (unlike boxer briefs / briefs).,66245,4
66246,"For the price I spent on the pair of shoes, I'd say it's as good as expected.",66246,4
66246,It's comfortable and doesn't hurt my feet when I run.,66246,4
66247,Absolutely great feeling wearing this!,66247,4
66248,They were given as a gift.,66248,4
66249,the cross back is kinda awkward.,66249,4
66249,generally nice and comfortable,66249,4
66250,"Really cute but specifically the one that ISN'T adjustable (the purple suede-type strand) is significantly larger than the rest, so it's really loose on my wrist.",66250,4
66250,"Other than that, these are great and I've happy worn them to Disney World during 2 different trips.",66250,4
66250,Stack them with your MagicBand!,66250,4
66252,The wig looks true to character and came with a wig cap.,66252,4
66252,"Like most wigs, the bangs did need trimming, but that was expected.",66252,4
66252,"It is an adjustable wig, and I didn't notice any shedding.",66252,4
66252,"The ponytail part is kinda odd, the base wig is in a ponytail, (which I would not recommend taking out) and you clip the other ponytail over it.",66252,4
66252,"I'm sure there was a reason they made the wig this way, but I truthfully have no idea what that reason is.",66252,4
66252,"Overall, I still really liked the wig.",66252,4
66253,Only 4 stars as the color is more navy than the royal blue in the picture.,66253,4
66253,"Good zippers, hardware and strap.",66253,4
66253,The Strap is not black it is brown.,66253,4
66254,It was shorter then I was expecting and kinda big for a 4!,66254,4
66254,But it is beautiful!,66254,4
66254,Both of these things can be altered!,66254,4
66255,"In the beginning I found not an easy thing to make it work, but  now two days later it's really easy ,and practical, clean and minimal design, 100% leather",66255,4
66256,Was great for my teenager!,66256,4
66256,Just stretches to fit and is soft.,66256,4
66256,Cups are lined with cotton.,66256,4
66256,"Shoulder straps are lacy/frilly (and not supportive) so older users may not love it as much, but is perfect for her.",66256,4
66256,Took a long time (2weeks?),66256,4
66257,Very nice but I had to to return it because the size 14 I ordered was too wide in the chest area.,66257,4
66257,She is slim and typically wears a 14.,66257,4
66258,"Nice,  just as expected",66258,4
66259,It kinda keep falling even though it fits me .,66259,4
66260,I wear mine all the time!,66260,4
66260,"I wish it was a little bit longer, but other than that it fits perfectly",66260,4
66261,"I pic the wrong size, dress is beautiful but not my size",66261,4
66262,This not a bad cowl for the price.,66262,4
66262,It comes packaged in a very small cardboard box so you should blow a balloon up inside upon opening it.,66262,4
66262,It also needs a little help with paint so all I did was lightly go over it with black spray paint.,66262,4
66262,Also adding velcro to the back helps close the seam.,66262,4
66262,This definitely beats buying the rubies mask.,66262,4
66262,If you don't want to spend $200 on a cowl and still want the doj look then you can't beat this price.,66262,4
66263,The pink is a little darker than pictured.,66263,4
66263,The metal is thicker than the picture looks.,66263,4
66263,Nice shiny sturdy chain with extra chain to make it longer.,66263,4
66263,All in all its a pretty necklace.,66263,4
66264,My only reason for not giving 5 stars was that I ordered 12 and 6 where the wrong color.,66264,4
66264,But I had to keep them due to time constraints.,66264,4
66264,Overall very happy with the bag.,66264,4
66266,only thing about these is that they seem to get a lot of pulls in them,66266,4
66267,My husband loved it!!,66267,4
66267,Is a bit smaller then I thought,66267,4
66268,"For the money, couldn't beat these!",66268,4
66269,This is a well made product.,66269,4
66269,The design though should have made more room in the front.,66269,4
66269,I purchased the XX large.,66269,4
66269,I usually fit a US large .,66269,4
66269,Even though the material is comfortable it was kinda tight in front.,66269,4
66269,I'm not big and it was snug.,66269,4
66269,I guess if you have more of a package up front the material will streach to form a larger pouch if you don't mind the snug fit.,66269,4
66271,These are so cute!!,66271,4
66271,"I wish the sizing was easier to understand, I got the 90 and it fits my son who wears 18 months size clothing.",66271,4
66271,"My only complaint is that these are a little baggy in the diaper area, would probably fit well with cloth diapers.",66271,4
66271,":) But they're super cute, appear to be very comfy and great price!",66271,4
66272,"Looks ok with a belt around the waist, otherwise it flots,and makes even the skinniest person look pregnant",66272,4
66273,beautiful ..nicer than the picture provided,66273,4
66274,This is sort of 2 bras in one.,66274,4
66274,The one next to your skin is a front closure bra.,66274,4
66274,I actually wish they offered it as a stand alone bra -- it was so cute and comfortable and it fits me better than my other bras!,66274,4
66274,The top layer is the zip up.,66274,4
66274,I struggled with getting the zipper started until I folded back the flap of cloth covering the zipper bottom; then it was easy.,66274,4
66274,The zip up layer is tight and compresses as it is a sports bra but it is not too bad.,66274,4
66274,I bought 2 other zip sports bras and this is the only one that I'm willing to keep and try out on the tennis courts.,66274,4
66274,Sizing: I wear 38C but have put on enough pounds that it is a tight fit.,66274,4
66274,This bra FeelinGirl in size XL fits.,66274,4
66274,Warners No Pinching (not a sports bra) in 38C fits though I might go up to 40.,66274,4
66274,Welco's Moving Comfort in 40C is too small.,66274,4
66274,La Isla High Impact in 38C was not even close to being able to zip up.,66274,4
66275,"Everything is good, I just thought it would be a little more orange, than a pink coral",66275,4
66276,I like them alot,66276,4
66277,"Cute shirt, too small tho.",66277,4
66277,"I'm about 5'8"" and 155 lbs.",66277,4
66277,and I got a medium.,66277,4
66277,Too tight on my boobs and arms especially.,66277,4
66277,Bra size is like 36B.,66277,4
66277,I might could make it work but it's pretty tight.,66277,4
66277,Arrived pretty quick tho,66277,4
66278,Beautifully crafted just a bit bigger than I expected.,66278,4
66279,wore it a number of times and got plenty of compliments,66279,4
66280,Have a good relationship with your spouse?,66280,4
66280,Comfortable being funny in your sex life?,66280,4
66280,Then these are for you.,66280,4
66280,I surprised my wife with these suckers - surprise is an understatement.,66280,4
66281,It wasn't as dark as I expected,66281,4
66282,I got this hat with my Imperial Officer pants and jacket and it overall is exactly what I expected.,66282,4
66282,"It's a little saggy in the back area of the hat, but other than that, I'm rather pleased with this hat!",66282,4
66282,And it does look like the picture!,66282,4
66283,The leggings fit somewhat small as they dknt even reach close the my ancles.,66283,4
66283,I like the design though,66283,4
66284,"Feels a bit cheap, but didn't get to wear it in the cold yet",66284,4
66285,The grey heather ones are made of a better material.,66285,4
66285,The black ones I ordered always collect dog hair and fuzz and are getting nubby/rough where my thighs rub together.,66285,4
66285,The knees are also slightly baggy which I don't like.,66285,4
66285,"I ordered small, I'm 5ft and 105lbs.",66285,4
66287,I love the top!,66287,4
66287,Its very cute and sits right where i wanted.,66287,4
66287,"It feels a little loose and not very supportive so i guess i could have ordered a size smaller, but im not going through the hassle of sending it back.",66287,4
66287,I normally wear an 18/20 so i ordered an 18.,66287,4
66287,I love the way the shorts fit too.,66287,4
66287,"This will be great for lounging in a pool, but i may find something else for when i do any actual swimming.",66287,4
66287,I recieved this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review,66287,4
66288,Love the boots so did my daughter.,66288,4
66288,The bunnies fell off but I fixed it is with glue.,66288,4
66288,I'd definitely buy from this seller again,66288,4
66289,"Super thin fabric.... but I kind of like it - its so light and comfortable, great for Texas layering",66289,4
66290,Had to get an MRI for my back and I have a bunch of piercings.,66290,4
66290,Bought these to put in my lip while I had the test and it worked great!,66290,4
66290,Good strong quality and long enough for anyone.,66290,4
66290,"The front piece is a bit difficult to put back in, but once I got it the stud stayed put!",66290,4
66291,I like a lot about the suit but I am busty so the top was too snug.,66291,4
66291,I am not a fan of padded cups so I cut them out.,66291,4
66291,not a good idea lol but I am ordering another suit the cargo shorts are super cool just wish more tops like this came without extra padding,66291,4
66292,it was the right shirt I was looking for glad I found it,66292,4
66293,Pretty dress but somewhat shirt.,66293,4
66293,Fits fine with me will wear a black leggings with it or just a cycling shorts,66293,4
66294,"a good pair of shoes,good to were all day!",66294,4
66295,I would have given it 5 stars except that it was a bit small around the thighs.,66295,4
66295,The waist fit perfect.,66295,4
66297,"Fit well and stayed ""cool"" really comfortable",66297,4
66298,Material is not what I thought it would be.,66298,4
66298,I also ordered a size up thinking it might be too small since I am a tall woman.,66298,4
66298,"However, I still love the shirt.",66298,4
66299,I love this purse!,66299,4
66299,I'm petite (under 5ft) so everything that seems to be trending is just way too big for my short frame.,66299,4
66299,"This is a small bag, but has plenty of space for all of my modest necessities.",66299,4
66299,"Also, the color is fun and vibrant without being overwhelming.",66299,4
66299,The material is durable and easy to wash and doesnt appear to scratch or scuff easily.,66299,4
66299,"The purse has 3 sections (2 with snaps and the center zips) plus an inside zipper pocket and two inside pouches, so organization is easy.",66299,4
66299,I would have given 5 stars if the over-the-shoulder strap wasn't so long.,66299,4
66299,"Even on the smallest adjustment, the purse hangs to mid thigh on me, making it uncomfortable to walk.",66299,4
66299,I tried wearing as a cross body but the purse is a bit too boxy to pull that off.,66299,4
66299,"It's detachable,  so I removed it and I just carry the bag by the handles, which can be troublesome when you need 2 free hands.",66299,4
66299,"Overall, I'm very pleased.",66299,4
66300,shipping was on time,66300,4
66302,What I expected to get!,66302,4
66304,"Snugger then expected, but fits OK.",66304,4
66305,Well made...fit as expected.,66305,4
66306,"Nice coat to small for arms and chest, I normally wear a large.",66306,4
66306,It fits like a medium.,66306,4
66307,Raising eyebrows n commenting.,66307,4
66309,Great quality for the price!,66309,4
66310,This is the second pair I have bought.,66310,4
66310,They really do help support my feet and relieve the discomfort of plantar fasciitis.,66310,4
66311,The ears didn't stay up even after washing and drying/fluffing and trying to bend them back with pressure.,66311,4
66311,"Otherwise, kept me warm and fit me well (petite female).",66311,4
66312,Nice dress for the price.,66312,4
66313,Good work shirt for my son.,66313,4
66313,"Should have noticed that it was ""long""  A bit wrinkly out of the dryer.",66313,4
66314,"Front bill not functional, other then that it is a nice hat.",66314,4
66315,It was good but it would be better is the note was metal instead of plastic,66315,4
66316,"The shirt is very thin, you'd have to wear a tank underneath.",66316,4
66316,The shirt is not that long as pictured.,66316,4
66316,"Otherwise, for the price it's good.",66316,4
66317,Works to hook two together or to hook a mitten to jacket sleeve so the little ones do not take them off while playing in the snow.,66317,4
66318,"I bought this belt expecting something different, it leaves no visible lines except for the side tightening buckle.",66318,4
66318,"But I feel as those any large amounts of activity and the stretch of the belt will allow ""something"" to show.",66318,4
66319,"The color is really pretty and unique and the bow is detachable, so it's nice if you like it more simple or with some flair.",66319,4
66319,The inside has 2 big compartments (one with small side flaps) and then a zipper pocket in the middle which I like very much.,66319,4
66319,I like the main zipper on top as well.,66319,4
66319,"It's smaller than I imagined, but works great for an everyday purse.",66319,4
66319,"The inside material is somewhat cheap, but it's still great for the price.",66319,4
66320,The dress itself is gorgeous with the top portion pretty detailed.,66320,4
66320,I am usually a M but to be safe I purchased a L because it's easier to take things in.,66320,4
66320,I'm glad I did as it fits pretty well with a little loose feel (probably best for dancing).,66320,4
66320,The material isn't the best there is out there but that is what you expect for the price.,66320,4
66320,There is a lot of extra material for the bottom so expect to get that hemmed.,66320,4
66320,The top portion material is super delicate where as the bottom portion is heavier.,66320,4
66320,It is true to the deep V cut therefore you would want to get fashion tape or invest in a sticky bra to avoid any slips.,66320,4
66320,"Overall, I really like the dress.",66320,4
66321,Overall look was good.,66321,4
66321,Runs smaller then suits that usually fit me in the same size I ordered.,66321,4
66322,"Out of the box I was skeptical, it seemed thin and bag like.",66322,4
66322,Put it on and it was really cute.,66322,4
66324,This little dress is very cute and very well made for the price!,66324,4
66324,The diaper cover is very ugly though.,66324,4
66324,"It's like a water proof type material that doesn't seem like they would be very comfortable, but the dress is definitely worth purchasing!",66324,4
66325,"Nice bright designs, a bit tight though.",66325,4
66326,The top part with the bow was too large and kept falling down.,66326,4
66326,I use it just as a maxi skirt and put something over the top.,66326,4
66327,This dress is gorgeous!,66327,4
66327,I'm glad I read the reviews to go with a size larger.,66327,4
66327,"I'm bigger in the bottom, but the top was a bit large.",66327,4
66327,However that's okay because the dress is absolutely fun to be in!,66327,4
66328,Excellent quality and also cheap.,66328,4
66328,It's heavy and suitable for minus degree temperature.,66328,4
66328,"Yes, I'll recommend it to others.",66328,4
66330,"A little scratchy under the arms but a great dress and good quality,",66330,4
66332,Nice but the chain was a little short.,66332,4
66333,These went well with my costume.,66333,4
66333,They fit to my thighs and are a tiny bit big and tend to slip down.,66333,4
66334,Fits ok but too close in the arms,66334,4
66335,Much better than what I was expecting,66335,4
66336,Not bad for summer time,66336,4
66337,"Cute, comfy and I ordered a size up.",66337,4
66337,Normally medium/36c but ordered large.,66337,4
66338,adds pazzaz to boots,66338,4
66339,Only four stars because the elastic waist is a little tight for the size.,66339,4
66340,"Good quality, a little large but still cute.",66340,4
66340,Just have to belt it.,66340,4
66341,I'm wearing them right now!,66341,4
66341,Look much more expensive in person,66341,4
66343,Love it but it broke after first time wearing it.,66343,4
66343,I fixed it with small plyers,66343,4
66344,Great quality for the price.,66344,4
66345,"I love that it has 2 snaps, since my niece has a very slim wrist.",66345,4
66346,"Fits well, and stylish.",66346,4
66346,You can't beat the price on this one.,66346,4
66347,I read all the reviews before ordering this purse.,66347,4
66347,And when i got it yes it is a large bag.,66347,4
66347,Can be large enough to be a purse and a diaper bag all at once.,66347,4
66347,You will definitely be able to carry everything you want in this bag.,66347,4
66347,When i fish got it the zipper's looked as if they were broken but i just worked them a bit and they are fine.,66347,4
66347,The main zipper suck a little but a gently rubbed a bar of soap across it and worked it in and i have not had any trouble with it since.,66347,4
66347,One tassel came off and was easily put back on with a pair of pliers.,66347,4
66347,Over all this bag has been worth the money.,66347,4
66347,It is very eau to carry as a cross over bag even very full.,66347,4
66347,And i am disabled and can't carry allot of weight.,66347,4
66347,Even though i had a few little problems in the beginning.,66347,4
66347,"I would definitely say, yes if your looking for a large bag i would tell you to buy this one.",66347,4
66347,It is as cute as it looks in the picture.,66347,4
66347,Overall a very nice bag and it came earlier than estimated which was a nice surprise,66347,4
66349,"Really cute fabric and style, but they have a weird wire in the tie part.",66349,4
66349,Definitely needed to take that out before using.,66349,4
66350,I washed this dress in cold water and put it in the dryer and it came out just fine.,66350,4
66350,The fabric is knit and is really stretchy.,66350,4
66350,"So, it fit me just fine.",66350,4
66350,It is also very long.,66350,4
66350,It will go down to your ankles.,66350,4
66350,"I don't like that it shows my belly button, but a slip underneath helps a lot.",66350,4
66351,"Love this shirt so much, I only wish I had gotten it in a bigger size.",66351,4
66351,It's still wearable and not too tight either but it does run a bit small but just get a size up.,66351,4
66351,But I love it overall!,66351,4
66352,The belt seems well made.,66352,4
66352,It functions extremely well.,66352,4
66352,I like the ability to adjust the tightness in small increments.,66352,4
66352,I also like the fact that the belt can be cut to the exact length you need very easily.,66352,4
66352,I think the belt is handsome.,66352,4
66352,My wife thinks it's pretty ugly.,66352,4
66352,I'm not used to wearing belts with such a prominent buckle.,66352,4
66352,The instructions were nearly useless.,66352,4
66352,"For one scary moment, I couldn't figure out how to get it off.",66352,4
66352,The mechanism is actually very easy to use but it's on the bottom of the buckle and not visible when it's on.,66352,4
66352,The instructions are pictures and don't do a very good job of showing the release lever.,66352,4
66352,"The belt, as you might expect, is substantially heavier than an ordinary dress belt.",66352,4
66353,"works great, good price!",66353,4
66354,I bought 3 different hats and they all were wrong!,66354,4
66354,I was very happy when I opened the box and tried it on.,66354,4
66355,Like the overall fit of these leggings.,66355,4
66355,"However, ordered a size larger than normal because I have wide hips, but waist band is too large, and tends to slip down on me.",66355,4
66355,"Good quality fabric, that gives, but holds its shape.",66355,4
66355,Will buy my regular size next time.,66355,4
66355,Would recommend to a friend.,66355,4
66356,I have plenty of back pairs in different styles this time I bought the royal blue and I love the color i usually buy small but this time I bought the extra small I'm pretty thick 5'3 (148lbs) and have nicely toned legs and slim at the waist got a little something in the trunk lol.,66356,4
66356,"But they fit just as expected, can't go wrong with 90 degree pants I love them and are my fav.",66356,4
66357,These are about what you'd expect for the price.,66357,4
66357,"The metal is a bit more gold than the picture shows, but they still look good.",66357,4
66357,The barrels are must flared plastic so they tend to slip forward a little throughout the day.,66357,4
66357,I think I'm going to remedy that by putting some o-rings on the back to hold them a bit tighter in my ears.,66357,4
66357,My 4-star rating is due to the fact that one of the roses was on there quite crookedly.,66357,4
66357,"It wasn't a big deal to fix since I just popped the flower off, peeled off the glue and then re-super glued it back on.",66357,4
66357,Took less than a minute and looks great.,66357,4
66357,"And honestly, for the price, I'm not upset about it at all.",66357,4
66357,Kinda what you'd expect.,66357,4
66357,They did come in a cute little black velvet storage bag which is nice.,66357,4
66359,very spacious and Nonbulky!,66359,4
66360,"Runs a small in the chest area if you're a big chested woman, but beautifully made even though I have to give it away.",66360,4
66361,"I guess I have a really long torso even though I am only 5'5"".",66361,4
66361,It offered no support for the girls.,66361,4
66361,This would be really cute on a girl with a smaller chest.,66361,4
66361,Good quality and fast shipping.,66361,4
66363,cute product and fit well!,66363,4
66364,Looks exactly as pic!,66364,4
66364,Shiny patent leather type look... For the price a cute and good purchase!,66364,4
66364,Came really quickly too!,66364,4
66365,Cute but a little small.,66365,4
66366,it didn't really look how I thought it would but it's cute and worth the buy,66366,4
66367,But it can be fix,66367,4
66368,The slot for the passport fits rather tightly.,66368,4
66368,I look forward to getting some use out of this.,66368,4
66371,Slim=fit for me needed extra large.,66371,4
66372,Great price and great sweatshirt!,66372,4
66373,"They fall a little, and are just a little on the short side, but overall I like these socks.",66373,4
66373,"Unfortunately, I think the biggest flaw is that you get three pair of the very same style and color scheme for the price.",66373,4
66373,Would be nice to vary it up a bit.,66373,4
66373,The only real reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the lack of variance in the three pair pack.,66373,4
66374,"I gotta say though, the sleeves are shorter than expected.",66374,4
66374,"If you guys ever want to fix something about the hood, you can take the edge buttons and place them further up on the shoulder to give more head space.",66374,4
66374,"Overall this is exactly what I expected in this order, but there are gold little buttons on the jacket that can brake easily.",66374,4
66374,The supplier also ships 4 extra buttons in case they do.,66374,4
66374,This jacket also has 2 zippers on each side of the torso/front body area for customizing your look.,66374,4
66374,In this product picture it is unzipped.,66374,4
66375,Ordered it for a friend who wears specs.,66375,4
66375,He did look better and good deal for Gucci.,66375,4
66376,My son wanted these shoes so badly and we are not disappointed.,66376,4
66376,"Are they the best shoes you will ever buy for your kids-no, they are not real leather, but they are holding up really well for the money.",66376,4
66376,"The lights are great, the kids love them.",66376,4
66376,I would definitely buy these again for my son.,66376,4
66376,"They are fun, good quality and arrived earlier than noted.",66376,4
66377,Runs tight but very sexy looking.,66377,4
66377,Bought large-he wears a medium in the tight breathable boxer briefs.,66377,4
66377,I washed on delicate & hung dry before wearing.,66377,4
66378,Super cute with a fun tank underneath.,66378,4
66378,"Wrinkles a bit easily, but still cute.",66378,4
66380,Fits great and was very comfortable.,66380,4
66380,Due to a surgical procedure I have to wear these for the entire day.,66380,4
66380,I was extremely pleased to have gotten these great bras at an even greater price!,66380,4
66381,They look and feel good.,66381,4
66382,I like this OK.,66382,4
66382,The color is very washed out - not bright purple as I thought it would be.,66382,4
66382,Nice fabric and well made,66382,4
66383,"I liked it, it wasn't that long but that was fine.",66383,4
66384,Fits smaller than expected but still fits and it's cute.,66384,4
66385,I knew buying this dress that the size Large would be a possible issue for me based on other reviews.,66385,4
66385,"I expected it to be a mini-dress as I am 5'10"" tall but that was ok for me and fit as so.",66385,4
66385,"The problem was with my athletic broad shoulders and arms being too tight and leaving my narrow 29"" waist baggy.",66385,4
66385,"Well the waist fit almost perfect.. barely clung to my waist line, just a bit loose.",66385,4
66385,"The shoulders and arms....  arms were tight but did stretch to fit, shoulders also stretched to fit but I could not  zipper up the approx.",66385,4
66385,"8"" long zipper on the backside without a risk of busting the zippers as other reviews have done.",66385,4
66385,You need to have some one zipper you up if it fits you that tight or it will break!,66385,4
66385,Not the strongest looking zipper but the construction of the dress was very well put together.,66385,4
66385,"I actually wore mine backwards, lol.",66385,4
66385,Funny thing was that it is symmetrical front to back minus the zipper.,66385,4
66385,This eliminated extra force on the zipper but I left it undone regardless as it looked sexier that way.,66385,4
66385,Not that you need to as the chest area is completely sheer anyways and will give everyone a nice show so if that's not your goal than plan to wear a bra or similar under the dress!,66385,4
66385,I will post a pic shortly,66385,4
66386,"I am enjoying the hat, soft and fits well.",66386,4
66386,Now I need it in black.,66386,4
66387,It appears to be nice looking but runs way on the small size.,66387,4
66387,My son usually wears Xl and the 2X was too small :(,66387,4
66388,Wish it had more pockets inside.,66388,4
66388,My son loves it!.,66388,4
66389,But very nice quality!,66389,4
66390,The bow on the back came off after one wash but it's still a cute shirt!,66390,4
66391,Somewhat too big but pretty,66391,4
66392,This wig had sufficient hair that it doesn't show my scalp or the netting.,66392,4
66392,"I wish it had more hair, but for the price, it was well made.",66392,4
66393,I love it alot!,66393,4
66393,"But beware, if you have a larger neck, the chain will be on the small side.",66393,4
66393,"A Choker should not actually feel like your being constricted, which mine did.",66393,4
66393,And it actually broke trying to take it off.,66393,4
66393,I had to add more chain to make it fit properly.,66393,4
66393,"My only complaint is that the chain really should be longer, and please be catious if you have a thicker neck.",66393,4
66393,But other than that it is made of good material and the bell stays on great!,66393,4
66394,"While these do provide great arch support, they have not helped to heal my plantar fasciitis.",66394,4
66395,I ordered this for a costume and it's really nice but It slips really easily.,66395,4
66395,Definitely not made for heavy wear.,66395,4
66395,the snaps are a little hard to attach to stockings but its still pretty good.,66395,4
66396,Wore this dress to my baby shower.,66396,4
66396,It is an extremely beautiful and versatile jersey knit dress.,66396,4
66396,Very flattering for any body type.,66396,4
66396,"Only real issue was the dress did have to be trimmed at the bottom, as there was LOTS of extra material",66396,4
66397,Good to accessorise your outfit if you need to transform your office attire into evening attire.,66397,4
66397,Keep this in your purse just in case you need it.,66397,4
66397,It looks quite impressive for the price.,66397,4
66398,"I bought this in a Large Womens for my mom, but didn't realize the women's cut was more fitted and ended up too tight for her.",66398,4
66398,"Nobody's fault but my own, just be aware of it if you like the traditional t-shirt cut to order it in a Men's.",66398,4
66398,"I ended up buying her a Mens Large, and that fits as expected.",66398,4
66398,The shirt is well made and looks great!,66398,4
66399,"I really love the design and it is well made
It is just a little smaller than I expected and the shoulder strap witch is removable keeps popping off.",66399,4
66399,But it does have the small Handel's.,66399,4
66399,I get lots of complements when I use it!,66399,4
66400,These socks are ideal for lightweight travel.,66400,4
66400,"They take up minimal space, and dry in a few hours.",66400,4
66400,"But, one of the two pair developed a ""run"" the first time I wore them.",66400,4
66400,The other pair has performed fine in 5+ uses.,66400,4
66400,They look like dress socks and seem to stay up without much sliding down the ankles.,66400,4
66400,"Pros: lightweight, space-efficient, very quick to dry, look fine with a suit or jeans.",66400,4
66400,"Cons: durability questionable (one failed on first wearing), no cushioning, synthetic fibers",66400,4
66401,Nice for the price.,66401,4
66401,It needs a little more insulation.,66401,4
66401,Lets a little wind blow through it.,66401,4
66403,"Kids pajamas are supposed to be snug fit, and I'd say this one falls into that category.",66403,4
66403,"It's not too snug, though, and my girl is not complaining about anything like that.",66403,4
66403,I think sizing is accurate.,66403,4
66403,And who doesn't love Hello Kitty?,66403,4
66405,Nice hat for the price.,66405,4
66405,Not a big hat wearer.,66405,4
66405,Very large for my head.,66405,4
66405,I don't think my head is small so I would rate this hat as running a little large.,66405,4
66405,"Not huge, but for bigger heads.",66405,4
66405,Seems like a decent straw hat but I'm nowhere near being someone that knows what I'm talking about when it comes to these hats.,66405,4
66405,I just bought it to keep my face from getting sun during radiation therapy.,66405,4
66406,I actually really like this shirt!,66406,4
66406,"I wear it bike riding bc it is so bright orange, which is kind of also what I don't like about it... otherwise nice cut, nice sew job without visible flaws and lays nice too.",66406,4
66406,It's a win but maybe I'll look for another color.,66406,4
66407,Great as a gift!,66407,4
66408,Standard brand that is built with high quality.,66408,4
66410,Like coz it fit great .my daughter was so happy with this dress,66410,4
66411,This dress fit great!',66411,4
66411,Loved it  I'm 5'9 179lbs and this dress definitely was a head turner!!,66411,4
66412,Perfectly functional and what I wanted.,66412,4
66414,"Warm, soft and fuzzy",66414,4
66415,"Good quality.. Mabe a bit too big, but ok",66415,4
66416,"I've bought two of these coats, one for my Mom and one for me.",66416,4
66416,We love this coat!,66416,4
66416,Warmer than it feels and have received so many compliments on it.,66416,4
66416,It's like wearing  a very good looking comfy blanket.,66416,4
66417,It's light and easy to carry.,66417,4
66417,"Not fitted at all, so it feels pretty big if I'm not wearing a second coat or sweatshirt underneath.",66417,4
66417,"There is plenty of room if you want to wear a thicker coat under, though.",66417,4
66417,"Wish it had pit zips and that it adjusted on both sides at the bottom, not just one, otherwise it's a great deal.",66417,4
66417,"Waterproof, although the I haven't warn it in really heavy rain yet.",66417,4
66418,The sleeves seem oddly short for such a long piece and it would be nice if there were at least straps to tie it closed.,66418,4
66418,I'm debating if it's worth altering since I don't expect to wear it much as is but the quality seems decent.,66418,4
66418,I should have paid closer attention to the details before buying.,66418,4
66419,"This product is as described, looks like photo shown and fits well ..",66419,4
66420,CUTE OUTFIT ORDER A SIZE BIGGER IF YOU HAVE HIPS AND A BUTT.,66420,4
66421,"Good quality, super soft",66421,4
66422,It runs a bit small..,66422,4
66422,I'm still very satisfied.,66422,4
66422,I love the artwork.,66422,4
66422,"The fabric the artworks on collects dust, lint, and hair easily.",66422,4
66422,But I don't mind.,66422,4
66422,"Wasn't expecting how it was made and fitted though, but as long as I can wear it, be comfortable, and it doesn't shrink and ruin the artwork when I wash and dry it.",66422,4
66422,I give it a four.,66422,4
66422,My new favorite shirt though.,66422,4
66423,It's a great dress.,66423,4
66423,The reason I gave 4 star is because the sizing is bit off and I wish they had more options for other sizes.,66423,4
66423,I will absolutely purchase the other dresses if it is available.,66423,4
66423,"Not, I am 5'2 and weight 250 Ib and it fits but little bit tight in the stomach area.",66423,4
66424,Needs a zipper instead of buttons.,66424,4
66425,Barely use it but it fits perfectly!,66425,4
66429,Very well designed with plenty of storage.,66429,4
66429,"I also am concerned about the phone sliding out of the pocket, though it is snug when I fill the clutch up with my stuff.",66429,4
66429,If it seems loose in the future I will probably sew in a strip of velcro or something to keep the pocket closed.,66429,4
66430,I love how they look and feel my only complaint is the g-string is a little to small for me.,66430,4
66430,Around the waist fits fine,66430,4
66431,It's really cute but thin and almost looks like it's been used.. You get what you pay for but its not bad.,66431,4
66432,"Had to buy it in large because it was way to small in medium, always get the next size up.",66432,4
66433,A bit too big and can be a tad itchy.,66433,4
66434,too expensive for a hat,66434,4
66435,Order a size a little large!,66435,4
66435,otherwise these overalls are great!,66435,4
66435,"Theyre a little short though, no matter what size.",66435,4
66436,"It looks just like the picture, fits well",66436,4
66437,as shown in picture but top is a bit squarish instead of round curving.,66437,4
66437,but very solid and good for price.,66437,4
66439,The bra part of it comes a little wrinkled but isn't as noticeable when wearing it.,66439,4
66439,Super cute and vibrant colors!,66439,4
66440,"It fits perfectly, and i wear it all the time",66440,4
66441,No problems with it,66441,4
66442,"Nice shirt, decent quality, lightweight",66442,4
66443,Colour of handbag is exactly as seen in photo.,66443,4
66443,A little smaller than I expected but still useable and cute!,66443,4
66444,"Unique bracelet, cool fastener.",66444,4
66445,I really like the dress.,66445,4
66445,It's gorgeous and fits like a glove.,66445,4
66446,This is a nice top.,66446,4
66446,"BUT: I ordered a XL, a size larger than I usually buy, as I wanted it to flow loosely.",66446,4
66446,"I felt it was not loose enough, so returned for an XXL!",66446,4
66446,"The sleeves, as usual, are longer than they need to be, but they look fine snugged up.",66446,4
66446,(The brown is too much on the purplish side & didn't match any of my brown pants so I went for the black Tie Dyed to be on the safe side.,66446,4
66447,This is a really cute hat!,66447,4
66447,I get compliments alllll the time!,66447,4
66448,"semi clear looks better on luggage, less tacky than all clear ones.",66448,4
66448,Only order set to use the hand carry only.,66448,4
66448,"Found useful at security check xray conveyor belt, easily clean off dust and gooey black tar from belts.",66448,4
66450,What do u expect for the price.,66450,4
66450,You get what you paid for.,66450,4
66451,Pretty scarf and excellent price.,66451,4
66451,"Would have given five stars except delivery time was very long, plus I ordered the white scarf and got a cream-colored one.",66451,4
66451,"Still pretty and close enough not to bother to return, but not what I ordered",66451,4
66452,Worked well for our party!,66452,4
66453,It is very good quality product.,66453,4
66454,This necklace got here in exactly two weeks!,66454,4
66454,I got so happy when first saw it!,66454,4
66454,(: the chain felt a bit delicate when I first opened the clasp so that I could wear it but other than that it's a good necklace!,66454,4
66454,I've gotten lots of compliments on it and people do not believe me when I say that got it under four dollars.,66454,4
66455,Haven't actually used it yet but the purse looks awesome.,66455,4
66455,Can't wait to try it out,66455,4
66456,"Nice shirt, but long.",66456,4
66457,Beautiful blouse but runs very small.,66457,4
66459,Small glasses with distortion free lens...not so dark you can't wear them grocery shopping or the like.,66459,4
66459,The bifocal lens at the bottom of the glasses is just the right position and size.,66459,4
66460,Really like this necklace.,66460,4
66460,I get lots of compliments on it when I wear it.,66460,4
66460,Only suggestion is: I wish they made the chain a little bit longer.,66460,4
66460,"Feels like it sits too high, and I don't have an unusually large neck or anything.",66460,4
66460,Really cute and would recommend.,66460,4
66461,"Cute dress, fits well.",66461,4
66461,The material isn't great.,66461,4
66461,It will be great for weekends or very casual outings.,66461,4
66461,"Comfortable and breezy material, but thin and obviously polyester.",66461,4
66462,Looked & fit well.,66462,4
66462,The sequins did seriously chafe me under my arms after an evening of partying.,66462,4
66463,I bought to use the pendent only but even the chain is of good quality.,66463,4
66463,And they make good charms for bookmarks.,66463,4
66464,"Super cute, but the sizing is weird.",66464,4
66464,"The torso section seems too short and too wide, and the feet are huge.",66464,4
66464,"As a result, they fit my baby now based on his torso size but the legs seem a bit long.",66464,4
66464,"Also, he tends to get a bit sweatier in these because the fleece doesn't breath as well as cotton... so I use these sparingly for when we're in cooler situations.",66464,4
66465,Really cute bathing suit!,66465,4
66465,"Fit is slightly small: ordered large, usually wear a size medium.",66465,4
66465,"The color is really light pink, almost a neutral color, as pictured",66465,4
66466,So much better than regular mittens.,66466,4
66466,Stays on all day.,66466,4
66467,"These are my favorite patterned socks, except they are a tad bit on the short side.",66467,4
66467,Somewhere between Crew and Ankle socks.,66467,4
66467,I wish they were just a little longer and more of a crew sock.,66467,4
66467,"Otherwise, they are good quality fabric and really cute with my nursing uniform and shoes",66467,4
66468,Very soft and stretchy.,66468,4
66468,The size was perfect.,66468,4
66468,Wish the panel for the c section was larger.,66468,4
66468,Cam only tolerate them for a short time.,66468,4
66468,Maybe once I heal more I can wear longer.,66468,4
66469,"Since other reviewers said this runs large, I ordered a medium and it was about right.",66469,4
66469,"I would consider myself to be a long-torso person, and the top of this is still a bit too long for me.",66469,4
66469,"I wish there was a good way to make it a bit shorter so that it doesn't bunch up and create the illusion of tummy rolls, which I have recently worked pretty hard to eliminate!",66469,4
66469,"Overall, I have made the fit quite good, but I did remove a piece of elastic from the inside of the back of the skirt that was about 6 "" long so it pulled the skirt to the point of being so tight it hurt.",66469,4
66469,Removal of that piece and the skirt hangs very nicely and the torso fit pretty well.,66469,4
66469,"The top part is definitely designed for a well-endowed person, so I had to take in a few inches there as well.",66469,4
66469,"The belt was a bit tight, so I moved the Velcro over to make it fit.",66469,4
66469,"The cape Velcro was positioned weird so that it scratched my neck when attached, so I moved  one piece 90 degrees to the other so that the neck attachment actually forms a ""V"" point, which I believe is how it is supposed to look.",66469,4
66469,"I am currently shopping for some boots to wear because the boot covers are a bit of a joke compared to the rest of the costume, which is pretty decent quality.",66469,4
66469,"Overall I do like the costume, but I would say that chances are quite slim it will fit anyone perfectly right out of the package.",66469,4
66469,"My top is the fuzzy covered foam material, and the skirt is a shiny polyester.",66469,4
66469,"I did buy some biking-type shorts to wear underneath for comfort, with the blue and white star pattern than matches almost perfectly.",66469,4
66469,"The skirt is a good length, but still a bit short for a 50 year old woman going out in public.",66469,4
66470,My God daughter loves them!,66470,4
66471,Funky stretch to the shorts but fit okay,66471,4
66472,"The red was a little pale, but it fit as expected.",66472,4
66473,This photo is not the same print as I was sent.,66473,4
66473,It's similar in color but the flowers aren't roses and they are all over the dress not just the bodice and hem as depicted.,66473,4
66474,"I love the looks of these, but the were a bit large around the waist.",66474,4
66474,Although they do have a draw string so that solved that problem.,66474,4
66474,The length is perfect.,66474,4
66474,"Pockets are very small, but not a real problem.",66474,4
66474,Fabric is a bit thin but not see through or hasn't ripped at all.,66474,4
66474,Got compliments on these.,66474,4
66474,"I would order again, just one size smaller.",66474,4
66475,"Expected it to fit different based on picture, but still would recommend",66475,4
66476,Does run a bit small.. Maybe it's junior..,66476,4
66476,I got a large when I usually wear s/m..,66476,4
66476,I'm 5'3.. 140 athletic build..,66476,4
66476,It fits great and has become one of my favorite.. Only complaint is one of the snaps fell off very early on and needed to be replaced...,66476,4
66477,"Not sure if the fit is exactly to size, as it is snug, but I read the other reviews and ordered a size up so it fits my daughter just fine.",66477,4
66477,Only complaint I have is that she shiny fabric has dulled rather quickly after several wears and washes.,66477,4
66478,Finally a long enough robe.,66478,4
66478,Could be a little softer but is soft enough,66478,4
66479,"I got this, and couldn't be happier about how cute it is, though, the belt was what stops it from being 5 stars, as it was significantly looser than it needed to be.",66479,4
66479,"I fixed it by alternating it with a black belt with a bow I had, that looked pretty much the same, and fit snug, but for other people, it could be troublesome, as it is what completes the dress.",66479,4
66479,"I suggest to buyers simply adding extra holes to the belt if needed, since it is totally worth it to wear this dress.",66479,4
66479,"I got a small, and the dress looks like it would be a tight fit, but the waist is actually elastic, allowing for people just a bit larger to fit if necessary.",66479,4
66479,"I typically get small sizes in the US, and I still had space left in the dress (but not too much that it made it too loose).",66479,4
66480,I have had one of these for several years.,66480,4
66480,My only complaint is that it does not seem to be made as well.,66480,4
66480,but overall very soft and comfy,66480,4
66482,LOOKS LIKE WHAT I WANTED.,66482,4
66482,HAVE NOT USED YET.,66482,4
66483,Bought as a gag gift and my friend loved it.,66483,4
66484,It was cute but too big.,66484,4
66484,I guess I'll save it for next summer.,66484,4
66485,"I ordered a medium as I like my pajamas a bit on the roomy side, I'm a size 6.",66485,4
66485,"These are a bit small, short in length and tight.",66485,4
66485,The fabric is nice and they seem well constructed.,66485,4
66486,Quality for the price.,66486,4
66487,Pretty but on the smaller side,66487,4
66488,Kind of sheer and long for me but really cute-love the popping colors,66488,4
66489,matches the dress it was ordered for.,66489,4
66490,Item was as described,66490,4
66491,Love this skirt and the rhinestones on the right front and back pockets.,66491,4
66491,I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because of the inconsistency on the length of this skirt in comparison to the other Style J skirts I have ordered.,66491,4
66491,"This skirt is 5"" longer than the other skirts.",66491,4
66491,This skirt is ideal if your are tall.,66491,4
66491,Love the fringe on the bottom but guess it will have to go to when I hem it.,66491,4
66492,Smaller than expected but fit.,66492,4
66492,Belt will not work for a large so I gave that to my daughter.,66492,4
66494,I purchased these for my twin goddaughters.,66494,4
66494,They were perfect fit according to their Mom.,66494,4
66494,She was especially please in the quality and texture of the fabric.,66494,4
66495,"The large fit as expected, I returned the medium because it was on the smaller size.",66495,4
66495,Break in this polyester and it'll be very nice.,66495,4
66496,I recently bought the LV Neverfull MM with the rose ballerine interior and was worried about the inside becoming dirty or stained over time.,66496,4
66496,Problem solved with this purse organizer.,66496,4
66496,"I bought it in lavender, which looks like a solid color in the photo, but just an FYI, the trim is a slightly darker purple color.",66496,4
66496,The extra jumbo size is definitely the way to go if you want a snug fit.,66496,4
66496,It fits nicely without being too tight or having to struggle to get it in and out.,66496,4
66496,"I have to admit that the Neverfull is the largest bag I own, so I didn't buy this organizer with the intention of transferring it from bag to bag.",66496,4
66496,"That said, I can certainly see how easy and convenient it would be.",66496,4
66496,The only thing I wish was different is the structure to the side of the organizer.,66496,4
66496,"As you can see in the photo there is a sort of ""wave"" that happens due to how it's packaged flat and (in my case) slightly bent.",66496,4
66496,But I think overtime it will loosen up and it doesn't really bother me that much.,66496,4
66496,You can also try to round out the sides by putting a flat shaped object in the side pocket (like a phone).,66496,4
66497,The dress is very cute.,66497,4
66497,I got a lot of compliments.,66497,4
66497,The only down side is that some of the seams were frayed when I got the dress.,66497,4
66498,My wife loved them.,66498,4
66499,Can't wait to use it this fall.,66499,4
66500,very cute and washed nice but somewhat smaller than expected.,66500,4
66501,the color of the polo shirt shown here is one step down when i received the actual polo shirt.,66501,4
66501,Anyway still a polo shirt to have.,66501,4
66502,Just what my daughter was looking for.,66502,4
66503,I'm 5'0 and 120lbs and it fits me perfectly!,66503,4
66503,I wouldn't recommend it for anyone bigger than me!,66503,4
66504,great for Elvis fans!,66504,4
66505,Fits well looks good,66505,4
66506,fits nice for the size as suggested,66506,4
66507,The breast area was too big for the size purchased.,66507,4
66508,"I intended to use this as a swimsuit top, but there is no lining whatsoever.",66508,4
66508,"The cups (although they aren't really cups, just the part where cups would be if it were a bra lol) are much smaller than pictured.",66508,4
66508,"It's still very cute, but I'll have to alter I before I can wear it.",66508,4
66508,Good for the price and shipping was incredibly fast!,66508,4
66509,Fit pretty well but a little too roomy.,66509,4
66509,The denim was very substantial.,66509,4
66509,Over all I'm pleased.,66509,4
66511,A bit small across the chest.,66511,4
66511,I still love it.,66511,4
66512,Bought them to take on vacation so I wouldn't break or lose my RayBans.,66512,4
66512,Now I wear them every day while on the road for work and keep my other pair on my car.,66512,4
66512,Great glasses for the price.,66512,4
66513,i love this case so much and it fits my 5c but its not made for a 5c.,66513,4
66513,its definitely for 5/5s.,66513,4
66513,the volume buttons don't line up correctly so its really touchy.,66513,4
66514,"Really like the shirt but it was to small,I'm thinking about ordering a larger size",66514,4
66515,"The zippers needed to be waxed because they were tight, but otherwise I am liking this bag very much.",66515,4
66516,Exchange for larger size was easy but price increased significantly .,66516,4
66516,Exchanges should be even in my opinion.,66516,4
66516,"Product was nice, very soft.",66516,4
66517,It was a gift for my daughter,66517,4
66518,"I really like these shoes, but the zippers dig into my achilles causing a nasty blister!",66518,4
66518,Hope they break in quickly.,66518,4
66520,"Product as advertised, I am using them in a pair of boots, so far so good.",66520,4
66521,I have bought several suit by this manufacturer.,66521,4
66521,I take water aerobics classes 3 times a week.,66521,4
66521,Water has salt and chlorine.,66521,4
66521,This suit will last for about a year.,66521,4
66521,Then material at seams get thin.,66521,4
66521,I have been swimming for about 3 years .,66521,4
66521,This is my 4th suit!,66521,4
66523,Great shoe for the beach.,66523,4
66523,They breath well and fit as expected.,66523,4
66523,A great purchase that arrived quickly,66523,4
66525,"For the price discount, you can't go wrong.",66525,4
66526,This is a very cute and well-made swimsuit.,66526,4
66526,It's just too small!,66526,4
66526,"We ordered a 2T for our 25-month-old, and it's too short in the torso for him.",66526,4
66526,We should have ordered one size larger.,66526,4
66527,They fit snug and stay together well in between layers.,66527,4
66527,They have been keeping my hands warm working in cold weather.,66527,4
66528,This shirt is really nice.,66528,4
66528,The only thing is that the sequin on the shirt comes off so you just have to be very careful.,66528,4
66529,Order a couple of sizes up.,66529,4
66529,"It is pretty, the color is more towards a light pink.",66529,4
66530,So I'm giving it 4 stars for right now.,66530,4
66530,Because I haven't worn it long enough & I obviously haven't washed it yet either.,66530,4
66530,I actually really like this product.,66530,4
66530,The package arrived wayyy before the delivery date I was given ( by like a month) & the package arrived undamaged.,66530,4
66530,The shirt itself was soft to touch & very soft on my skin.,66530,4
66530,It fit literally exactly as shown.,66530,4
66530,I have the thick thighs & big butt.,66530,4
66530,I orderd a large & it fit perfectly.,66530,4
66530,As it being to tight around the thighs for some women..,66530,4
66530,I think this particular shirt is made for the right size thighs.,66530,4
66530,"So if yours are bigger then average, then it might be uncomfortable for you.",66530,4
66530,"& if your super skinny & not as curvy, the shirt won't fit exactly how you want it to.",66530,4
66530,"As for the buttons, many reviews said they popped off & ripped instantly...",66530,4
66530,The shirt isn't thick material.,66530,4
66530,"So when your snapping of the buttons, don't literally rip them off.",66530,4
66530,I also read that a bracelet was supposed to be included as well.,66530,4
66530,I did not receive one.,66530,4
66530,Overall I'm happy with this purchase.,66530,4
66530,Just an fyi:if your taller then 5 ft I would try a size bigger might fit better.,66530,4
66530,But I honestly think this shirt was made for little people (like me ) & I love it.,66530,4
66531,the shirt is lovely and feels nice.,66531,4
66531,after reading the other reviews I bought a large instead of my usual medium and  it fit perfectly.,66531,4
66531,I plan to but in different colors and patterns.,66531,4
66532,This was a gift- well recieved,66532,4
66533,"These are cute necklaces and inexpensive, I got the red and black ones.",66533,4
66534,"I was looking for a ""Hawaiian"" shirt that wasn't too ""Hawaiian"".",66534,4
66534,The pattern is very subtle.,66534,4
66534,"It fit a little larger than expected, but I have not washed it yet, so probably will be fine.",66534,4
66534,"There were some loose strings at the seams; I cut them and there doesn't seem to be a hole, so it's okay.",66534,4
66535,The chain broke right after it was put on.,66535,4
66535,Replaced with a dog tag chain.,66535,4
66535,Works perfect that way.,66535,4
66535,I was happy for the price I paid even with the chain breaking.,66535,4
66536,Based upon reviews I ordered a med vs a small for my daughter and it definitely fits like a medium.,66536,4
66536,She's 5'4 130 pounds and the small wouldve pry been perfect,66536,4
66538,These little socks helped prevent some nasty blisters.,66538,4
66538,I just wish they were roomier.,66538,4
66538,I really had to stretch them to get them on.,66538,4
66539,Very comfortable when dry.,66539,4
66539,A bit sticky when sweating.,66539,4
66539,"Thought they would wick away moisture like Duluth Buck Naked underwear, but not as effective.",66539,4
66540,I love the price and quantity for these and the different variety.,66540,4
66540,Much better than what I was expecting.,66540,4
66540,I haven't worn them often because they are slightly bigger than my normal piercing and for some reason I was only able to get one in.,66540,4
66540,"When school is out and I don't have 10 minutes to get ready in the morning, I look forward to wearing these often!",66540,4
66540,"At first, it was confusing like, how to open them, but I quickly learned and then it wasn't so bad.",66540,4
66540,I love the colour and sizes and they don't hurt.,66540,4
66540,I haven't had a problem with them breaking.,66540,4
66541,"Beautiful fabric, thick material and an awesome purchase for the money (assuming you can get it by way of Amazon Prime, that is.",66541,4
66541,I had mine in 2 days).,66541,4
66541,But definitely size up!,66541,4
66541,According to the seller's measurements I should wear a small/medium; I bought an XL and it fits well but is still a little short in the torso.,66541,4
66541,I'm only I'm 5'5!,66541,4
66541,I definitely don't see this being long enough in the middle for anyone taller than that.,66541,4
66542,These are larger and stickier than others have bought in the past tho seem quite sturdy and should last well.,66542,4
66542,"For a bra-hating person, they are the perfect solution (unless you need some uplifting!).",66542,4
66542,The first time it was almost painful removing them but at least they won't fall off (like some older ones did).,66542,4
66545,"Product arrived on time and looks good too, but the bells came off when opened.",66545,4
66546,I revieved my refund from the seller.,66546,4
66546,I love the dress.,66546,4
66546,Its true to size and I recommend to buy from this seller.,66546,4
66547,"This is a very feminine, pretty blouse.",66547,4
66547,My only complaint is that it is dry clean only.,66547,4
66547,"Other than that, I love it!",66547,4
66548,"But I ordered a medium & its way too big, I tried reading the reviews before deciding on the size but I am returning for a small.",66548,4
66548,I am 5'4 & 120 pounds & a 34B.,66548,4
66548,the medium top fit a little big but the bottom was WAY to big on me so hopefully the small will be perfect!,66548,4
66549,Fixed my issue immediately and wanted to insure my happiness as a client.,66549,4
66550,"its slightly tight on me in the chest and kinda short, like an XS.",66550,4
66550,"but good quality, could pair with leggings or dark tights.",66550,4
66551,They are like Yeezys and very cool wearing them in public!,66551,4
66552,I like this shirt I got the largest size they make and it fits fine.,66552,4
66552,I am not offended by this shirt and think it's cute.,66552,4
66552,I took off one star because I it's a shirt not a sweater,66552,4
66553,Says United but not Manchester.,66553,4
66554,Well made; not flimsy.,66554,4
66554,Great design with clear lines and bright colors.,66554,4
66554,Only drawback is that it's a round design on an oval buckle.,66554,4
66554,"My preference would've been that more of the buckle would be covered by the design, but the black background of the buckle helps to hide that minor ""flaw"".",66554,4
66557,Worked out perfect for my daughters prom dress.,66557,4
66558,Went well with my wedding attire.,66558,4
66558,"Not sure why there is a ""fit"" rating for this.",66558,4
66559,A little bit scratchy for me but pretty enough to overlook that.,66559,4
66559,I bought several pairs as gifts.,66559,4
66560,I am a size 10 - 12 and usually buy medium tops.,66560,4
66560,The chart says a size 10 should order and extra large.,66560,4
66560,Since I usually wear medium and the chart says xl I went with a large.,66560,4
66560,The large top is a little too big.,66560,4
66560,I plan to exchange for a medium... should have stayed true to my size.,66560,4
66560,"The misleading size chart is the only reason I gave it 4 stars, otherwise, i LOVE the look of this top.",66560,4
66560,It is perfect top for work and date night (I would never wear it as a dress as it is too short).,66560,4
66560,I think is made well and I highly recommend it....stay true to your size.,66560,4
66561,"I'm 5'5, 134lbs, 36D bust, and I ordered a medium.",66561,4
66561,The dress is very beautiful.,66561,4
66561,Very thick quality & the overall fit was great and as expected.,66561,4
66561,"It's a bandage dress and its supposed to be tight, so I'm not sure why other reviews complained about this.",66561,4
66561,This dress is just not for me.,66561,4
66561,I think I'd definitely be too self conscious wearing it.,66561,4
66561,It's a head-turner for sure!,66561,4
66561,I ordered the light purple and the color was just like the picture showed.,66561,4
66561,Others had stated theirs was almost pink.,66561,4
66561,That was not the case for me.,66561,4
66561,This is a beautiful dress if you want a show stopper!,66561,4
66562,I really like this swimsuit.,66562,4
66562,The bottoms are a bit small and the top is a bit big.,66562,4
66562,Still looks great though.,66562,4
66562,It will just make you more motivated to get your butt in shape.,66562,4
66563,"I love the light blue color I received/purchased, it is so soft but I can see where it's not too durable.",66563,4
66563,"Please remember that the stuffing is NOT included, which is fine and is listed in the description; I'm pointing it out for those who overlooked that.",66563,4
66564,"Not for  water,  more as a cute novelty.",66564,4
66565,"It is a an attractive ring, but not as brilliant as described in previous reviews......wouldn't fool anyone even at a distance...",66565,4
66566,Only complaint is color is VERY different than picture.,66566,4
66567,This is a lovely sweater and I gave it to my husband for his birthday.,66567,4
66567,I should have ordered a size smaller than he usually wears as this is too big.,66567,4
66568,Just what I wanted.,66568,4
66569,It fit pretty well but there is almost too much fabric between her legs and causes her to look like she has camel toe because  it gets bunched up.,66569,4
66569,Does show some butt check.,66569,4
66569,Top fits very well.,66569,4
66569,I will have to buy some different bottoms.,66569,4
66569,"Had a TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE smell when I took it out of the package!",66569,4
66570,Short but I love it.,66570,4
66571,The heel slips down sometimes when wearing lose shoes.,66571,4
66572,It's a nice dress.,66572,4
66572,A little bit large fitting though.,66572,4
66573,I was pleasantly surprised that these are slightly decent quality.,66573,4
66573,I got them to spruce up photo shots I'm taking if nail art I'm doing.,66573,4
66573,These are just right for the job.,66573,4
66574,"Its an ugly sweater, what would you expect ha ha.",66574,4
66574,Only thing I didn't expect (even though it lights up) is the huge battery pack and gobs of wires.,66574,4
66574,Its akin to being connected to an EKG.,66574,4
66575,Just perfect for my baby,66575,4
66576,This hoodie arrived quickly which is always great.,66576,4
66576,At first I was surprised how small it appeared.,66576,4
66576,There is only one size.,66576,4
66576,"The material is soft and stretchy and I ordered this for the handy pockets in the front (for keys, etc) while running.",66576,4
66576,Im 5foot 2 and 112lbs.,66576,4
66576,This hoodie fits (close to the body not tightly) and feels good on.,66576,4
66576,Im not certain how it would fit for a larger sized person.,66576,4
66577,"This is a fun options for night light, or just light effects.",66577,4
66578,Very light and stylish.,66578,4
66578,Used them when surfing and they did exactly what they are supposed to do.,66578,4
66579,I bought this for my 7 year old to complete her costume.,66579,4
66579,It was huge for me but we will add a few touches to make it fit smaller.,66579,4
66579,We are going to try to either add elastic or Velcro.,66579,4
66579,Otherwise this product for her costume.,66579,4
66579,Its soft and plush like a teddy bear.,66579,4
66579,I am happy with the purchase.,66579,4
66581,My arch was too high on top to wear but well made and I love the brand,66581,4
66582,My son loves these.,66582,4
66582,"Compared to Vans, definitely hold up as well, and are well made for half the price.",66582,4
66582,"In the future, I will opt for DC than the other.",66582,4
66583,Great buy and it worked perfect for what I needed it for.,66583,4
66583,I will wear it agian,66583,4
66584,"I ordered these as a gift for my brother, we loved them!",66584,4
66584,They are really pretty and they look exactly like the ones in the game.,66584,4
66584,"I'm giving this four stars, because the box was a little damaged, nothing outrageous but I think that maybe a little bit of bubble wrap would make a difference.",66584,4
66587,I like them - they are soft just put in a dryer if you wear then a second time without washing - they get stretched out,66587,4
66590,"This dress looks just like the picture and is adorable on, but it was WAY SMALL.",66590,4
66590,I gave it to my friend and it looks great on her.,66590,4
66592,"cheaper material than I thought, but they fit well",66592,4
66593,Hey no one forgot I was there!!,66593,4
66594,the design is printed on and the fabric is thin but it is worth the price.,66594,4
66595,I bought this for one of my daughters.,66595,4
66595,It fits snug which is great for keeping the beach sand away from sensitive skin.,66595,4
66595,It's lightweight material best for summer swimming.,66595,4
66596,I got this for a Christmas gift.,66596,4
66596,I think it will fit a 4 yr old boy for a couple years.,66596,4
66597,"Made in Pakistan, thin material, but perfect for seasonal wear.",66597,4
66597,It is a tiny bit larger which is great for wearing over a sweater.,66597,4
66597,The shipping was very fast even with post office.,66597,4
66597,I will more from this company,66597,4
66598,"Very roomy but, not over sized.",66598,4
66598,Good fit and covers well to keep you dry.,66598,4
66598,"However, if it's hot and humid you will sweat a lot for this shell does not have any vents!",66598,4
66599,"My daughter was two weeks early, 6lbs 9oz and this cap barely went/stayed on her head.",66599,4
66599,"It was adorable and obnoxiously cute, as intended, but a smidge more fabric would have allowed us to feel it wasn't constrictive on her head.",66599,4
66600,nice  for  the  price  thanks,66600,4
66601,"The product is great, I have a citizen watch and if it is completely drained and I want to wear it on a cloudy day a have a problem.",66601,4
66601,This Solar Charger can get it charged enough to be wearable in one hour and a half to two hours.,66601,4
66601,It can fully charge in about six hours.,66601,4
66601,Plastic could be made better.,66601,4
66601,Can be powered by USB or two AAA batteries.,66601,4
66601,I would buy again.,66601,4
66602,"Lost the top screw within the first couple days of wear, luckily I had a blue top laying around from one of my old belly buttons.",66602,4
66602,"It has not fallen off since, definitely a beautiful design and color.",66602,4
66603,My boobs are too big....,66603,4
66603,The bottoms fit perfect but My boobs spill out of the top.,66603,4
66604,Priced high but nice product,66604,4
66605,This dress runs very small.,66605,4
66606,The color is hard to wear some thing with it but jeans.,66606,4
66606,Fits good and is really long.,66606,4
66606,I like the beads that are around the neck.,66606,4
66606,Makes it lood dressy.,66606,4
66608,Great worout option .. good value,66608,4
66610,I have a Titin weighted compression shirt in addition to these shorts.,66610,4
66610,"I bought these products because I had been hitting the wall in terms of my PB circuit times for the trails/mountains I run, and I was looking for a way to gain more speed.",66610,4
66610,"My plan was to train with the added weight and try to drop to my old PB WITH the weight, then run without the weight on race days.",66610,4
66610,"The results of this have been nothing short of spectacular, and both Titin products work great, but in terms of bang for the buck, I think the shorts do more for me based on my primary application despite being lighter than the weighted shirt.",66610,4
66610,A slightly more detailed analysis of that follows.,66610,4
66610,"While you can add more weight with the shirt than you can with the shorts, the weight placement on the shorts is more targeted and makes activities that involve running or climbing stairs quite a bit more difficult than just adding more weight to carry.",66610,4
66610,"You're carrying about 1.7lbs (3 gels) around your mid thigh per leg in addition to the gel that is carried higher and closer to your hip, so every time you lift your leg to step, you're lifting that extra weight before pushing off.",66610,4
66610,"1.7lbs may not sound like much, but after a few hundred stairs, you absolutely feel it.",66610,4
66610,"In a few hundred more stairs, you start thinking fantasizing about taking the shorts off and burying them.",66610,4
66610,I mean that in the best way possible.,66610,4
66610,"But when I run races without the weight, I feel like I'm running on the moon.",66610,4
66610,It's amazing how much lighter and more explosive you feel when you do the same activities without the weight that you'd been doing to train with the weight.,66610,4
66610,"If you already have the Titin compression shirt, I still highly recommend the shorts.",66610,4
66610,"Depending on your application, you may benefit from the lower center of gravity that the shorts provide.",66610,4
66610,"The shirt alone can make you a little top heavy, although that may be exactly what you're looking for to enhance your workout.",66610,4
66610,"In any case, I can't think of a workout that would NOT be enhanced by these items.",66610,4
66610,Both the shirt and the shorts fit well and keep the gel weights pretty firmly in place.,66610,4
66610,"I trail/stair run in both of these products, and the weights do not bounce or take on a life of their own.",66610,4
66610,"That was a real concern of mine before spending the serious dollars that these products cost, but Titin seems to have solved that problem.",66610,4
66610,"While the shirt system has an extra compression shirt that helps keep the weights secure, I just wear normal workout shorts over the Titin shorts, and it feels just fine.",66610,4
66610,"The shorts have a belt mechanism up top to keep them from falling down, and it actually worked surprisingly well.",66610,4
66610,"I'm normally a men's medium for things like shorts and underwear, and the medium-sized shorts fit me perfectly.",66610,4
66610,So why not 5 stars?,66610,4
66610,"Just a few reasons:

1.",66610,4
66610,Inserting and removing the gel weights is quite a hassle.,66610,4
66610,That's in part just the price you pay for the weights being held so securely in place.,66610,4
66610,"Still, in Titin's 2.0 version, I'd like to see weight pockets that were just a little easier to manage, possibly with wider openings and some kind of fastener or flap to close when the weights are in.",66610,4
66610,"The weights are a much bigger pain to insert into the shirt, however.",66610,4
66610,"The weights themselves are also not particularly washable, and trust me, they are going to get quite sweaty.",66610,4
66610,"The gels are coated in some kind of lycra-like fabric, and I've yet to find a really effective way to clean them.",66610,4
66610,"They don't smell bio-hazard awful yet, but I feel like they may someday.",66610,4
66610,"These shorts are expensive, and there's not much about them that seems to justify the cost.",66610,4
66610,"They are shorts with pockets and a basic belt, and weights are just some kind of gel that probably cost $0.50 to make.",66610,4
66610,They are not spun from spider silk or designed by Jony Ive.,66610,4
66610,"The quality is fine, but still, the price point is perhaps a bit high for most people.",66610,4
66610,"Similar things might be said about other ""simple"" fitness products however.",66610,4
66610,"I'm looking at you, TRX.",66610,4
66610,"In any case, the shorts are significantly cheaper than the shirt, so if you are only going to buy one or just want to try it first, maybe the shorts are the best way to wade in.",66610,4
66611,"I like the shirt, and it arrived quickly, but it is nowhere near being true to size.",66611,4
66611,I ordered a XX-Large and the shirt that came is equivalent to a U.S. medium at best.,66611,4
66611,"So sad because, as I said, I really like the shirt...",66611,4
66612,"This hat is HUGE, but good quality!",66612,4
66613,"The fabric is beautiful, the medium was too small through the bust line and shoulder.",66613,4
66613,"Would have exchanged for a large , but they were out of stock.",66613,4
66614,"Im 5'4"", 125lbs and I ordered a size medium.",66614,4
66614,"Fits as it looks in the photo, I usually wear small but I think if I had ordered a small it would be too short.",66614,4
66615,I loved how it was flowy.,66615,4
66615,But I had a little too much room in the top.,66615,4
66615,Everyone said I looked great in it.,66615,4
66615,I had to get the largest size due to me being hippy.,66615,4
66615,But well worth the buy.,66615,4
66616,"Nice to find the same pair, albeit different color, of Nike Exofit mid workout shoes on amazon.com.",66616,4
66616,"I used to wear these to walk/workout/light running back in the 1980s when these first came out, and they were/are extremely comfortable and provide a stable support system to the foot.",66616,4
66616,"Not for heavy-duty running or jogging, but just fine for general wear and working out (weight training, etc.).",66616,4
66617,Looks nice wth my sleeveless shell.,66617,4
66619,"It's super soft, and great quality.",66619,4
66619,"It does run a little short on the torso length, but it's not too noticeable.",66619,4
66620,The medium is a tad smaller than expected though...or I'm bigger than I thought :-),66620,4
66621,"A good hat for the sun, I'm just breaking it in now but in a couple of months I may have more to say.",66621,4
66622,I like these except the flare at the bottom.,66622,4
66622,But I took a small white thread and pin tucked the sides and they look cute.,66622,4
66622,Love the guaze for summer.,66622,4
66623,"My grandson thought it was too plain, so I  returned it.",66623,4
66624,In transit for return as too small.,66624,4
66625,"Great outfit , especially for price.",66625,4
66626,Heel and arch are super comfortable.,66626,4
66626,Shoe was squashing my toes a bit so that part was uncomfortable even though I went half a size up so they do slip off a bit.,66626,4
66626,Not as comfortable as some other heels I have in that aspect but hoping I just need to break them in a bit.,66626,4
66626,"Also, shoes not as black as they appear in photo.",66626,4
66627,"Super cute, super cheap can't complain about it.",66627,4
66627,However it isn't exactly the most well made item (hence the price) I tore it twice just putting it on.,66627,4
66629,"Great for the under $5 price, and a hit with the 10 year old Minecrafting crowd.",66629,4
66630,VERY cheaply made product but for the price that's kind of what I expected.,66630,4
66630,The bar is something you could bend in half.,66630,4
66630,It is hollow on the back.,66630,4
66631,I'd have preferred a little tighter knit but its a really nice sweater just the same.,66631,4
66631,"If you like the looks of this item, buy it.",66631,4
66633,"Bullko Men's Retro Pin Buckle 7060 Genuine Leather Belt

I like the belt.",66633,4
66633,Glad I made purchase.,66633,4
66633,This is the real deal belt.,66633,4
66633,It can be squeaky when moving while sitting around but that's what leather does.,66633,4
66633,"Belt does wear where it bends around the buckle ... wear as in color fades a little, but only a little.",66633,4
66633,It adds character to this belt.,66633,4
66633,I like the thickness filling in the belt loops a bit more.,66633,4
66634,I love this dress!,66634,4
66634,It's can be casual or dressy.,66634,4
66635,Sister wanted and she looked very odd with them on.,66635,4
66635,Just not her thing....she went through a hipster phase.,66635,4
66635,Didn't break to my knowledge.,66635,4
66635,Looks to big to be real.,66635,4
66636,This dress is really cute!,66636,4
66636,But you absolutely need a high waisted belt to wear with it.,66636,4
66636,"I'm 5""6 and it's not as short as shown in the picture.",66636,4
66636,It's a good length.,66636,4
66637,Just a Nice clean hat....looks great and good material,66637,4
66638,I love the shoes but there too small im sending it back and buying the same pair in a different size,66638,4
66639,I'm using this for a Freddy Krueger costume.,66639,4
66639,I think it looks perfect for the costume.,66639,4
66639,It could use a band so that it fits more snuggly on the head.,66639,4
66639,For my purposes it's excellent.,66639,4
66639,It fits very well on top of my mask.,66639,4
66640,Shirt arrived in good time.,66640,4
66640,"After washing it, it held it's color & shape.",66640,4
66640,"I am a medium size, but sadly this is too small.",66640,4
66640,"I am 5'4"", 130lbs, and this shirt is too small, especially in the arms.",66640,4
66640,I highly recommend ordering a size up.,66640,4
66641,Yes fit well and comfortable.,66641,4
66642,Fits perfectly and I like the material!!,66642,4
66643,Fits a little small but love the design.,66643,4
66644,A bit more rigid than I would have liked but I understand that it's what makes it less likely to break.,66644,4
66645,"I love this shirt, the material is SO soft.",66645,4
66645,"It runs a bit small, so unless you like your clothes pretty tight, go a size up.",66645,4
66646,decent quality for the price.,66646,4
66646,gets the job done,66646,4
66648,The head bands were a little larger than I expected but they are very cute!,66648,4
66649,I love the back of the top piece on this swimsuit.,66649,4
66649,"The top is amazing (a little sideboob shows, but not too much to be noticeable).",66649,4
66649,"The small was pretty perfect for me ( 5'4, 115 pounds).",66649,4
66649,The bottoms are extremely small though.,66649,4
66649,"They still fit, but shaving is pretty necessary.",66649,4
66649,The bottoms do cover everthing.,66649,4
66651,I love these leggings!,66651,4
66651,They are so comfy & buttery soft!,66651,4
66651,I would give 5 stars but I  think it's a stretch to call these plus size.,66651,4
66651,I am 6-8 petite pants.,66651,4
66651,I ordered these based on other reviews.,66651,4
66651,"I don't like my leggings really tight, so these were perfect.",66651,4
66651,I guess high waist means not low rise.,66651,4
66651,These hit me right at the waist.,66651,4
66651,They run very small.,66651,4
66652,Very cute for the price,66652,4
66654,These are very appealing and pretty.,66654,4
66655,I will wear it with pride!,66655,4
66656,"Pros- great price, comfortable, fit well, and I especially love that they are a little longer (i'm tall so capris always end up bunched just below my knees).",66656,4
66656,Con- They WILL show sweat.,66656,4
66656,"I'd wear them to yoga or around the house, but if you are going running or doing heavy cardio in warm weather, be aware that you will be showing some serious swass.",66656,4
66657,"I bought these glasses for a halloween party, and they were pretty darn cool.....until they stopped working.",66657,4
66657,"After approximately 1.5 hours of use, the light went out and never came back on.",66657,4
66657,"I immediately thought the batteries died, so I replaced them with new ones I had with me, but that didn't rectify the problem.",66657,4
66657,"I visually inspected the wiring and the neon piping, but there was no obvious damage or loose parts.",66657,4
66657,"The red light on the battery pack lit up with each press of the button as I toggled through the lighting options (solid, slow blink, fast blink), and seeing as though the batteries and battery pack were working, I concluded that it was a wiring issue likely stemming from dancing.",66657,4
66657,"I contacted Amazon about the problem, whose outstanding customer support issued me a refund upon receipt of my glasses.",66657,4
66657,"I rated 4 stars because the glasses were of good quality, and were what I expected based on videos and pictures I viewed prior to purchase.",66657,4
66657,"One thing I DEFINITELY advise, is to order the clear lenses if wearing them in a low light setting, you'll be glad you did.",66657,4
66658,"Bought XL for 5'5"" 135 lbs.",66658,4
66658,I looks great though.,66658,4
66659,Would have given the item a five star except I ordered a size bigger than usual because I'm larger up top (40DD) and the xxl top of this suit is is still to small :(  I'm a 14 on the bottom on a good day and 16 on a bad day and the xxl bottoms fit great,66659,4
66660,a little high on the sides,66660,4
66661,"Bought it for a ""crazy cat lady"" costume for work.",66661,4
66662,Liked the product but it is larger than the size you choose so you may want to chose the next size smaller than the actual size you need to order,66662,4
66663,Used these for sons swim lessons and they worked like a charm.,66663,4
66663,Just be sure to order a size up they run kinda small!,66663,4
66663,Fits nicely overtop swim diaper.,66663,4
66664,Very soft and comfy.,66664,4
66664,Dress it up or dress it down.,66664,4
66665,"These are very comfortable leggings, and I also really like the depth of color.",66665,4
66665,"I usually wear a size 12, so I was concerned that these would be a bit snug for being one size fits all.",66665,4
66665,"I feel like there's a little too much room yet in the waist area- I was concerned about them falling down, even though they didn't in actuality.",66665,4
66665,If there is one negative it is that these are definitely leggings to be used as tights- NOT a pair of leggings that one would wear as yoga pants or for lounging around the house.,66665,4
66665,The material is too thin to be worn without something covering the panty area.,66665,4
66665,"They worked great underneath the shirt dress I wore them with, and I'm considering puchasing a second pair in a different color.",66665,4
66666,If you are traveling by plane this back pack is actually the right height and width for a carry on.,66666,4
66666,":) Try not to fill it too much because it will be hard to get it in to the over head compartment, but with a little pushing and shoving you can get it in the compartment.",66666,4
66666,Also try and put all the items that air port security will want to look at easy to get to.,66666,4
66666,I was searched three times on my flights to Israel and had to repack my back pack all three times.,66666,4
66667,Order a size up.,66667,4
66667,The 6mos fit a 100 (3months and change) days baby just right.,66667,4
66667,Best used in an air conditioned or cool environment.,66667,4
66667,Fabric doesn't breath at all.,66667,4
66668,Look good arrived on time.,66668,4
66670,"I ordered this hat as part of a Halloween costume, which is good because it was mailed in a bag with no protection at all.",66670,4
66670,It arrived with the bag torn and the hat crushed and bent.,66670,4
66670,"The material is easily reshaped, but the dents in the top portion in the hat will never completely come out right.",66670,4
66670,"Also, the hat is small for me, and most ""one size fits all"" hats normally fit me just fine.",66670,4
66670,"Also, the hat is not ""floppy"" as it is described.",66670,4
66670,The material is fairly stiff.,66670,4
66670,"The hat does look good and in its somewhat beat up condition, it is perfect for my costume.",66670,4
66670,"But if you are looking for a fashion hat to wear,  this hat probably wouldn't work for you since it isn't mailed in a box to protect it.",66670,4
66670,I imagine that every hat that they send out arrives in a similar state as mine did.,66670,4
66670,"If you are looking for a good looking hat to go with your costume, and don't mind that it arrives flattened, this is a good deal.",66670,4
66670,The hat look good and the price is right.,66670,4
66670,*Update: I received an email from Elenker shortly after posting this review.,66670,4
66670,They apologized for the crushed condition my hat arrived in and offered me a full refund as well as saying that they would recommend a change on how this hat is packaged for mailing.,66670,4
66670,I declined the refund since I do intend to use this hat as part of my Halloween costume and I wouldn't feel right taking a refund on a product that I am using.,66670,4
66670,"However, the fact that Elenker contacted me right away and offered a refund is a big plus for me, so I am bumping this hat up one star because the company is responsive to their customers needs.",66670,4
66671,"Too small, but gave it to my niece who likes it.",66671,4
66671,Looks real cute on her.,66671,4
66672,"I did not keep them, the design was clunky and they were sent in wrong color.",66672,4
66672,But the footbed is the same as several others that I get and works wonders for high arches.,66672,4
66673,"Some of the stitching is meh, but overall satisfied!",66673,4
66674,The shoes fit well in the arch area.,66674,4
66674,"They are a little wider in the toe area of the shoe, you feel like you have a lot of room.",66674,4
66674,"This does not make the shoe uncomfortable, just had to get used to it.",66674,4
66675,Tight in shoulders a bit but still fits great.,66675,4
66675,I got a medium and am 5'8 and 140 and it fits just how I'd want it.,66675,4
66675,I was worried it would be way short but it wasn't.,66675,4
66675,It didn't go all the way to the floor though.,66675,4
66675,Looks how it's pictured,66675,4
66676,I purchased this in a size L for my daughter to wear to a 50s party.,66676,4
66676,It was a jacket a polka dotted neck scarf.,66676,4
66676,"She's 5'1"", about 125 lbs and It fit just right.",66676,4
66676,We probably could have gone a size up for the baggy fit but this was just right.,66676,4
66676,"When ordering, you will need to decide if you want a little extra room or not.",66676,4
66676,The quality was good for a costume but that's all it was--costume quality.,66676,4
66676,It's cute and everyone will know who you're supposed to be.,66676,4
66676,"I was able to iron it on a low setting and we did not experience any of the issues I noticed in other reviews, like threads coming loose or tearing.",66676,4
66676,"For the price and what you'll be using it for, it's a good deal.",66676,4
66676,"I would personally suggest going up a size no matter what, because you'll be wearing a shirt under this and that may affect the fit.",66676,4
66677,My husband loves the movie.,66677,4
66677,He started laughing so hard when he opened the gift.,66677,4
66677,The material is soft and the color is bright.,66677,4
66678,"This outfit is very cute, especially if your child loves tutus.",66678,4
66678,It held up but the tutu has these floss like strings that are coming out of the layers.,66678,4
66678,We had to cut some off so that they wouldn't get pulled out.,66678,4
66678,"I believe if they get pulled out, it will ruin the tutu.",66678,4
66678,"They are all over, so little hands can easily start pulling on them.",66678,4
66679,need dryer to shrink,66679,4
66680,i'm not sure i'm cool enough to wear these in public.,66680,4
66680,"comfortable, convenient and classic.",66680,4
66682,"This jacket is new so I've only been wearing it a couple days now but today was 32 and with a wind chill so a cutting breeze of course and it wasn't coming through the jacket on my walk, it was only piercing my face, and legs that were exposed with cotton garments or no garments.",66682,4
66682,So far I am happy with it.,66682,4
66682,I went with a much larger size because fitted coats always seem to run very small but this one is true to size so it's too big for me (due to my own fault) but I am going to be layering under it so it'll work!,66682,4
66682,Def a good coat.,66682,4
66683,Considering the low price the suit was well-made.,66683,4
66683,I will have to see how long it lasts but so far so good.,66683,4
66684,"Although I absolutely love this product, I did buy the wrong size.",66684,4
66684,They are way to tight around the bottom two straps which go between your bum and the beginning of your leg.,66684,4
66684,"So in short, I weigh 160lbs.",66684,4
66684,"and i'm 6 foot tall, with a 30in waist.",66684,4
66684,So if i was to buy this product again i would personally buy at least a large.,66684,4
66684,"This product actually has a comfortable sized contoured pouch which is some what hard to find in foreign underwear, typical of underwear found on Amazon.",66684,4
66684,"Also I found that this underwear, provides just enough black materiel to also cover your bum hole which makes it not feel like a thong.",66684,4
66684,"So in all I personally love this product, but if you have a 30 in.",66684,4
66684,"waist or a round bubble but, please buy yourself a large or extra large just because I wouldn't want your legs to fall asleep, trust me.",66684,4
66685,It's not too big or too small,66685,4
66686,The length of a suit is short.,66686,4
66686,"Especially, if you adult never keep in mind
I bought 12 size..",66686,4
66687,"So cute, my little man is ready for summer parties.",66687,4
66689,It did shrink on delicate setting on dryer first time I washed it.,66689,4
66690,Smaller than I wanted but I still love it!,66690,4
66690,"I have an iPad Air 2 so I can't fit my tablet like the picture suggested but if you want a small purse with a nice, long and comfy crossbody fit, you've found a great option.",66690,4
66691,I ordered this for my 7 year old daughter.,66691,4
66691,My daughter is petite and skinny and so it was maybe too large for her.,66691,4
66691,The dress though is beautiful.,66691,4
66691,She wore it at a wedding and she got lots of compliments !,66691,4
66692,Perfect for everyday use.,66692,4
66692,"Fabric is not see through, but has a very low back, so not appropriate for your typical bra.",66692,4
66693,"There is an extra piece of material in the front over the chest area which is confusing as to why it's there, however, I still really like the shirt.",66693,4
66694,"I do enjoy the fabric, I like how thin it is.",66694,4
66694,I also love how the symbol is actually apart of the hoodie rather than just an iron on or a stitch on.,66694,4
66694,It came in almost a week earlier than expected.,66694,4
66694,"The only thing displeasing about this product is, the hoodie was NOT the exact color.",66694,4
66694,"Yes I received a green, Choromatsu, hoodie, but instead of being a very olive color, it came out to be a neon green, almost borderline yellow.",66694,4
66695,Just gave it my daughter and ordered an XL for me.,66695,4
66696,"I wouldn't consider them toddler gloves, maybe 1 1/2 to 2 year old tot.",66696,4
66696,Good thing I have two toddlers and this fit the youngest.,66696,4
66696,Otherwise good quality and warm.,66696,4
66697,"It's a lot smaller than we had expected, so if you need room it doesn't have a  lot.",66697,4
66697,"Not a ""normal"" size backpack.",66697,4
66697,"But otherwise a great backpack, great colors and details.",66697,4
66698,Looks nice but the white anchor looks like it's going to fade after a wash.,66698,4
66699,Very cute... so many compliments .... the ears are adorable the dress makes you feel girly..... you will be happy... but Bobbie socks and Mary Jane ... as I did ..... cute,66699,4
66700,"Its a very well made bag, good quality in the materials and the finish, mi wife like very much.",66700,4
66702,I am really enjoying this wallet!,66702,4
66702,"I was hoping to store a bunch of my loyalty shopper cards, but some of the side pockets (by the cash compartments are just too narrow for some of the slightly larger cards.",66702,4
66702,The leather has also gotten a bit scratched from day to day use.,66702,4
66703,I just received this today.,66703,4
66703,The colors are very pretty!,66703,4
66703,I've been looking for something like this that wasn't to expensive and good quality and this was  it for sure.,66703,4
66703,The reason this has received only four stars was because of the gold chain.,66703,4
66703,It was very short and hard to clasp.,66703,4
66703,Instead of making this a huge problem I am just going to buy a longer one somewhere.,66703,4
66703,The purple one is slightly lighter in color but I actually like it.,66703,4
66703,The clear one has a crack inside of it and I expected it to be more whitish but it was actually completely clear which was a slight disappointment.,66703,4
66703,The pink one was gorgeous.,66703,4
66703,"Here are my best liked to least liked: pink one, purple, clear",66703,4
66704,I love these leggings.,66704,4
66704,My one issue with them is that I had to have the waistband fixed because it was really harsh and cut in a lot.,66704,4
66704,"It was easy enough to fix, though, so now I'm just in love.",66704,4
66704,"They're polyester, so don't expect to be able to wear them during cold weather.",66704,4
66704,"However, they're pretty, they're comfortable, and worth it for the price.",66704,4
66705,"Beautiful pair of earrings -- I just wished it was a little daintier, they were actually quite large - about half an inch square (didn't look carefully at the pic so I didn't expect it).",66705,4
66705,They have quite some weight to it and the crystals don't look cheap.,66705,4
66705,"Overall, I still like it -- I just wish they'd make a smaller, daintier pair.",66705,4
66707,I got this for the hemline feature.,66707,4
66707,It's a great turtleneck and it's soft.,66707,4
66707,The item arrived quickly and in great condition.,66707,4
66708,Daughter loved the material and was insane about the print.,66708,4
66708,"I liked the realistic look, and it's easy to clean.",66708,4
66709,"A little scratchy/itchy, but cute.",66709,4
66709,"Looks a little boxy on me, but it may just be my frame.",66709,4
66710,I was a little worried about ordering this because it was so cheap but I'm glad I did.,66710,4
66710,It looks very nice and I think that it will look great with my weddig dress.,66710,4
66710,$2 is way better than $150 for a veil.,66710,4
66710,Now I won't be upset if I don't wear it if the wind is bad.,66710,4
66711,When I usually get my daughter an adult large and it's usually a little big iPod her.,66711,4
66711,"Once one, it is a bit snug around her stomach.",66711,4
66711,It is a nice costume otherwise.,66711,4
66713,"a little bigger than expected, but is beautiful all the same",66713,4
66714,Normally wear a medium.,66714,4
66714,The shoulders fit me in xl.,66714,4
66714,I understand some of the comments about not fitting like the model.,66714,4
66714,Try tucking some fabric under the waist band for less of a pooch.,66714,4
66716,Gift for friend; very nice.,66716,4
66719,Came in a day earlier which was great.,66719,4
66719,Although it didn't match the picture exactly but I am still very happy with the product.,66719,4
66719,I would advise you to go 1 to 2 sizes up if your looking for an oversized kimono the large was an OK size but should have gotten an extra large.,66719,4
66720,Just like the one that wore out.,66720,4
66720,Zipper goes on them.,66720,4
66721,"Other than the top is a little boxy, almost as if it's wider at the top than bottom.",66721,4
66721,"But, I can live with it.",66721,4
66721,Great for the price!,66721,4
66722,Very pretty and good quality,66722,4
66723,I like this product but I have thicker thighs so it was tight around my legs.,66723,4
66723,After wearing it a few times it seems to be better but there is not much stretch at all in the legs.,66723,4
66724,I'm using it for a photoshoot so I didn't mind the thin fabric.,66724,4
66724,It price was great and perfect for what I needed it for.,66724,4
66725,"Not very realistic but I've used it for 3 halloweens now, fun product.",66725,4
66726,really cute but just slightly to small for my neck,66726,4
66727,It is such a cute little outfit.,66727,4
66727,I just love the design and the fabric.,66727,4
66727,The only reason I gave it four stars is cause it's a bit on a small side.,66727,4
66728,"Like this top, a bit flimsy though.",66728,4
66728,a little too see through.,66728,4
66729,"Got it quick, shorts ""tight"" in the crotch but def worth it to me",66729,4
66730,"Okay so I read the reviews on this and everyone said it ran extremely small, or that it was for boys and not men.",66730,4
66730,"I'm 5""9 180 pounds broad shouldered.",66730,4
66730,The size I NORMALLY go for is medium to large.,66730,4
66730,I bought an XXL taking everyone's word on it.,66730,4
66730,The thing was pretty big.,66730,4
66730,Very loose just looked bad.,66730,4
66730,"I returned it and went for an XL, it fit a little better I could probably go for a large.",66730,4
66730,Keep in mind if you are looking to buy that it is a SLIM FIT.,66730,4
66730,So if you are overweight the shirt more than likely will 1.,66730,4
66730,Not fit or 2.,66730,4
66730,Make you look bigger than you are.,66730,4
66730,"Someone said the shirt was like a paper material, its not.",66730,4
66730,Its very light cloth excellent when the summer hits.,66730,4
66730,I am very content with the shirt and will likely be buying another one!,66730,4
66731,Looks just like photo.,66731,4
66731,Clasp broke after first wear and now pops open,66731,4
66732,Somewhat small and shrinks a bit after washing but still nice top.,66732,4
66733,A little aggressive cleat for turf but does the job and really enjoyed playing in them,66733,4
66734,"Very comfortable dress, however the arms and chest were a bit too tight.",66734,4
66735,Got it for my daughter but the strap is entirely too long for her.,66735,4
66736,"These are very comfortable, with soft leather, nice grip and flexible soles!",66736,4
66736,My biggest complaint is they are very wide and the velcro strip is too small to tighten them as much as he needed.,66736,4
66736,"If your son has wide feet, buy them!",66736,4
66737,It perfectly fits on my hand and is very light so I don't feel it on me.,66737,4
66737,Its a nice bracelet to have it on all occassions whether formal or social.,66737,4
66737,I would recommend it to everyone who are not afraid of wearing attractive jewelery.,66737,4
66739,Great dress but the arms are a little tight.,66739,4
66740,Not big enough to hold my first grader's books.,66740,4
66740,"Then again, I live in the caribbean so maybe we use more books..",66740,4
66740,The little accesories on the zips keep falling off also but all in all a very girly/ princessy bag,66740,4
66741,"Beautiful dress excaltly like the picture, very finest but mine unfortunately had a stain on the back which I think came from the gold, but besides that it was beautiful, I love it",66741,4
66743,Was a little disappointed to see one had a hole in it after 1 wash and 1 wear.,66743,4
66743,We live in sub zero temps and these are nice to send baby out in for the day.,66743,4
66743,Not as high quality as Carter's but a good buy plus cute prints.,66743,4
66744,Overall a great shoe.,66744,4
66744,They do run a little on the small side and a little narrow also.,66744,4
66744,Should have gone with at least a half size bigger.,66744,4
66744,Although still quite new the quality seems reasonable.,66744,4
66744,The detail in assembly however could have been better as excessive glue is visible on many of the seams.,66744,4
66745,I'm sad that I have to return this because I loved it on the model!,66745,4
66745,"Based on the way it fit me, I'm guessing the model is wearing a size or two bigger than what she normally wears.",66745,4
66745,"I ordered the large, it fit but it didn't fit how a kimono should.",66745,4
66745,"I'm 5'4"", 170lbs, and a 38dd for reference!",66745,4
66745,Still giving 4 stars because the quality was good.,66745,4
66745,The sleeves did sit a little higher up on my arms too.,66745,4
66745,Closer to the elbow.,66745,4
66746,It was comfortable and easy to breastfeed in.,66746,4
66746,"I wore it in the hospital, I am not normally a nightgown type person but wanted something to keep me covered while getting around in the hospital.",66746,4
66746,I would say it was a bit tighter than I had hoped but it did the job and I was able to feed the baby and keep covered!,66746,4
66747,"I love these, but I wish they had made them stain/water resistant.",66747,4
66747,They discolored and stained so fast.,66747,4
66748,Just too big otherwise I liked them!,66748,4
66749,I can see my little one growing into them.,66749,4
66750,This suit is really cute on!,66750,4
66751,These are very cute and soft.,66751,4
66751,"The only thing is after you wear them for a few hours, they start to hurt your head a little.",66751,4
66751,"Other than that, they are great<3",66751,4
66752,Very cute but seem very big for the size,66752,4
66753,"Needed a Bridal Shower Dress that was a lighter color, but not white
2.",66753,4
66753,"Fit Perfectly; ordered a size 2 and it fit exactly well with no adjustments

66753,"Beautiful jewel work, unique pear shaped jewels

66753,"I loved it, and everyone loved it too!",66753,4
66753,"Shipped in a good time
8.",66753,4
66753,"Cones with extra beads

Cons
1.",66753,4
66753,"Biggest con was that the some of the jewels were falling off, right when I ordered it and pulled it out of the package there were a lot of beads falling out from the bag.",66753,4
66756,It's a bit small but otherwise I liked it!,66756,4
66756,Cutouts in the back are cute.,66756,4
66757,Arrived much earlier than expected....two weeks earlier.,66757,4
66757,Was looking for a hat to wear for rainy weather when running.,66757,4
66757,It is thin with mesh on each side.,66757,4
66757,"I think it will serve much better as a summer cap to keep the sun off my face, yet not smother my head due to thick material.",66757,4
66758,I LOVE the Tokidoki brand!,66758,4
66758,I have all the badge reels and now these scissors!,66758,4
66758,"They don't stay shut very well, the screw holding them together is somewhat loose and difficult to tighten.",66758,4
66758,"However, they do work well for tape and corrugated tubing.",66758,4
66759,"Nice shirt , it's more of a fitted size , tight on the sides",66759,4
66760,"Very flattering, slims out your stomach area.. im overall happy.",66760,4
66761,Cheaply made but only ordered for one time use wear.,66761,4
66761,"If you are tall, be prepared it is cut high on the sides.",66761,4
66763,"Cute, but a little cheaper made than expected.",66763,4
66764,Told them my measurement came out good.,66764,4
66764,Everything fit and looked good.,66764,4
66765,"Pros:  perfect fit, light weight

Cons: collar flips up occasionally",66765,4
66766,"Kind of bug eyed big,,,but stylish and cute....i will.wear a few times and give away too big on my head.....but love the color and quality",66766,4
66768,"Very cute, looks just like the pictures.",66768,4
66768,I ordered an size larger then I usually wear and it fits perfect.,66768,4
66768,Not skin tight but fitted and comfortable.,66768,4
66768,It's thin but I was looking for a lightweight hoodie so for me it is perfect.,66768,4
66768,Would've given 5 stars but some stiching came loose after one wash.,66768,4
66768,I washed it in a delicates bag but i think I might hand wash it from now on so it will last longer.,66768,4
66768,But I still plan on ordering more colors!,66768,4
66769,Does what I needed.,66769,4
66769,To use under summer tunics.,66769,4
66771,Super cute but a little short...,66771,4
66771,"I am 5'8"" and it cut off at my shin.",66771,4
66772,Daughter used them for the first half of her pregnancy and they were great,66772,4
66773,"Bright yellow, fits true to size!",66773,4
66774,"Wasn't exactly what I expected, but have had many compliments on it.",66774,4
66777,"It a lil snug in the arms, but everywhere else fit well and hid the dreaded muffin top.",66777,4
66777,But I wear this blouse  with my leggings!,66777,4
66777,"so, I'm happy with my purchase, and the price was right!!!!!",66777,4
66778,Very pretty for the price.,66778,4
66778,"I am a 34B and it was surprisingly tight in the chest for me, so I sent it back.",66778,4
66779,"Everything is perfect, but I wish I could remove the drawstring in the pants.",66779,4
66779,It's attached at the back.,66779,4
66779,"It makes the waist too tight, but everywhere else, including length, is perfect.",66779,4
66781,My son wears 10-12 in regular clothes.,66781,4
66781,"These ones were to fit 9-11, they are way too small for him and he only weighs 68 lbs, but he is tall.",66781,4
66783,Great price for the product.,66783,4
66783,The only reason this didn't get 4 stars is because the remote control can be tricky to use.,66783,4
66783,"Otherwise, when it works... it works great.",66783,4
66784,"They are a little slippery and hard to stay on, but still like the product.",66784,4
66785,"it is really nice , only wish it was a little bigger.",66785,4
66786,bright colors and nice top,66786,4
66787,"I dressed it up for work, and wore it walking about on vacation.",66787,4
66788,Love the material and the price is nice,66788,4
66789,"Fit as expected, comfortable!",66789,4
66790,Really pretty but seems cheaply made.,66790,4
66790,"Also, it is a sheer material.",66790,4
66790,I had to buy a slip to wear under.,66790,4
66790,Despite this it is really Pretty!,66790,4
66792,Very pretty and perfect for office.,66792,4
66792,The material is not great at washing though.,66792,4
66792,"Washed it 1 time in the washing machine and 3 times hand wash. Won't last long, so I bought 3 more :)",66792,4
66793,This will be a wonderful shirt for after I have our little girl!,66793,4
66793,It is attractive and functional.,66793,4
66794,"Nice small bag for carrying some papers, small note pad, and an ipad in.",66794,4
66794,"If you looking for something to carry binders, multiple large folders, etc, this isn't the bag you want.",66794,4
66794,Seems well constructed and sturdy.,66794,4
66794,"Been using the bag now for about 2 months and only downside I have noticed is the material it is made of, has not softened up yet.",66794,4
66794,"If left in an awkward position for an extended period of time, it will bend to that shape and you have to straighten everything back out.",66794,4
66795,"very pretty, is a bit more dressy than a usual t-shirt",66795,4
66796,A cheap way to make any outfit tied together.,66796,4
66796,The black will go with any black jeans and perfect to make your girly outfit look more tom boyish.,66796,4
66796,I like the look of the hats as it is more feminine than that of a normal baseball cap .,66796,4
66797,This peacock charm necklace is lovely; the colors are nice.,66797,4
66797,It was a big hit as a gift.,66797,4
66798,Nice but tight around the neck for larger men,66798,4
66799,"snug fit, still keeping",66799,4
66800,Super cute I got the all black one.,66800,4
66800,It's not the most sturdy and the zippers seem breakable af but you get what you pay for.,66800,4
66800,Exactly the right size and pretty much exactly like the picture.,66800,4
66800,It smells like fishy or something but I put fabric sheets in it and it's going away.,66800,4
66800,All in all I love it,66800,4
66802,Wish they made this in cotton!,66802,4
66803,Thanks for a good product,66803,4
66804,"bigger than I expected but no big deal, I like big sunnies.",66804,4
66804,"They're comfy and cute, I would definitely buy them again!",66804,4
66806,great for the price!,66806,4
66807,This dress was great for a game day.,66807,4
66807,"I usually wear a 4/6 and I think I could have even worn an XS in this but the S worked, just a little loose.",66807,4
66808,I've had them for a couple of weeks and seem to be made well.,66808,4
66808,I like the larger lenses.,66808,4
66811,It was very nice!,66811,4
66812,Just my size and good fabric.,66812,4
66813,A bit too short.,66813,4
66814,"Really nice shoes, but not wide enough for my feet.",66814,4
66815,sizes are just a little large,66815,4
66816,Nice looking piece overall for the money.,66816,4
66816,"Nothing super fancy, and so far holds up great.",66816,4
66817,The zippers and pulls are strong and it seems to be well made.,66817,4
66817,Time will tell how well it holds up.,66817,4
66817,For right now it is great.,66817,4
66818,Great graphics excellent colors but does tear in the crotch area.,66818,4
66818,I reinforced the stitch and no problems.,66818,4
66819,"Excellent quality, sturdy, very large brim and crown.",66819,4
66819,This is the hat if you want shade and to protect you face.and neck.,66819,4
66819,"Unfortunately, brim was bent almost beyond re-shaping because of flimsy inappropriate packaging.",66819,4
66819,Pillow packing does not protect this kind of hat from getting squashed.,66819,4
66819,"In addition, brim was over-bent to fit in box.",66819,4
66819,Good hat but very disappointed I how it arrived,66819,4
66820,Just what we needed,66820,4
66822,Love it for some reason it makes me look like a have a really tiny waist!,66822,4
66823,Stone are very nice.,66823,4
66824,A very cool shirt to wear when you go out anywhere,66824,4
66825,Little snug but a really neat shirt,66825,4
66826,Love this dress and would have given it a 5 star rating but I was not happy about how high the elastic band sat.,66826,4
66826,In the photo it seemed as though the placement where the top ended and the skirt began was at the waistline but it actually sat about 4 or 5 inches above that.,66826,4
66826,"All that being said, I would purchase again.",66826,4
66827,"Overall, good for the price.",66827,4
66827,These types of crop tanks in yoga studios or other stores cost close to twice or three times as much.,66827,4
66827,"Pros-
Fits like a sports bra, material is stretchy, comfortable

Cons-
Stitching is not the best, runs a size small",66827,4
66828,Thought these would he more temporary however they turned out really well.,66828,4
66828,I like them after you wear them for a while they will bounce back to half their size when you take them off.,66828,4
66829,These are great toe socks so that I can wear my fitflops even in the winter.,66829,4
66829,"I only wish they came in knee socks, and were a bit thicker!",66829,4
66830,"nice product, well delivered.",66830,4
66831,"it was suggested that you order a size larger than dress size, but it would have fit better if dress size was ordered it's okay because it's a coat",66831,4
66834,"Cool hat, it keeps the sun off my face and neck like I was hoping.",66834,4
66834,But it is too small.,66834,4
66834,I usually wear a 7 5/8 or a 7 3/4 baseball cap size and I can barely fit this thing on my head.,66834,4
66834,I am wearing it on the top of my head where my hairline meets my forehead and it is working out.,66834,4
66834,I'm hoping it will stretch out or I may get a haircut.,66834,4
66834,Other than that is worth the $19.,66834,4
66834,**update** after wearing in 7 times it is stretching out and fits much better.,66834,4
66835,It was form fitting but very comfortable and glad that it had some spandex in the material.,66835,4
66837,Beautiful dress just runs way too small!,66837,4
66837,I originally bought it for a very petite 12 year old however I end up giving it to a 6 year old,66837,4
66838,I'm a 34b and ordered a large it fit in the arm And chest area but it was kind of loose fitting at the bottom.,66838,4
66838,Perhaps after a wash it will shrink some.,66838,4
66838,Keeping my fingers crossed.,66838,4
66838,Not bad for six bucks though.,66838,4
66839,I absolutely love this sweatshirt.,66839,4
66839,It's incredibly warm which is exactly what I was looking for.,66839,4
66839,I went off the reviews and saw people wrote that it ran small.,66839,4
66839,"I'm a pretty slender person, 5'5 and normally wear small clothing so I went with a small.",66839,4
66839,I'm wishing now I went with XS because I like my  sweatshirts to be tight on me.,66839,4
66839,"This one fits kind of odd, it's got a lot of room in the body but the arms are very tight.",66839,4
66839,It has the fleece all through the arms which is why it's a little tight there so wearing long sleeves makes it a tiny bit too tight honestly but I think with wear it will work it's way out.,66839,4
66839,All in all I am happy with it!,66839,4
66840,"Comes unassembled, you get several yards of satin ribbon and then the actual beaded and jeweled piece you see in the picture.",66840,4
66840,When ordering it doesn't tell you  that you will have to finish it yourself.,66840,4
66840,Has very vague directions on how to finish it.,66840,4
66840,It is lovely but needs much better directions.,66840,4
66840,"Matches my gown perfectly, and a good thing that I sew or I would have no idea what to do with the two pieces.",66840,4
66841,"Great price, cheap buttons",66841,4
66842,"Nice looking dress but way too small, I wear an 8 but ordered a 10, it barely went over my hips which are only 35, order a bigger size.",66842,4
66842,"Returned the dress but had to pay $34 in shipping charges to China, I was only reimbursed for the price of the dress but at least it was credited in a timely manner.",66842,4
66843,"Its very pretty and made of nice, soft material.",66843,4
66843,It clung to my body more than I expected.,66843,4
66844,I was super excited when I received my waist trainer in the mail!.,66844,4
66844,"At first, I thought it would be too small, however after clipping the piece together, it was not bad at all.",66844,4
66844,"However, it did not cover my entire abdominal region.",66844,4
66844,"I was expecting for it to fit long wise, however I have learned how to put it on to where it fits.",66844,4
66844,"Over all, I do really like this product!",66844,4
66845,Just a little itchy because it's lace.,66845,4
66845,But looks and fits well,66845,4
66846,"I love the shirt but for a large, it was way too small.",66846,4
66846,"Too bad, this was ordered as a gift and I don't have time to send it back and get a larger size.",66846,4
66848,I loved the look of this dress in the pictures.,66848,4
66848,I'm having to get it tailored quite a bit though.,66848,4
66848,"I knew I'd have to but to get it looking like the pics, expect to spend $300+ in the tailoring.",66848,4
66848,but I was very happy with the quality and the design.,66848,4
66848,"once it is done, it will be gorgeous",66848,4
66849,Nice fitting comfortable hat.,66849,4
66850,"First pair I bought stuck great, second pair i bought has not been stinking as well.",66850,4
66851,"Impressive engineering design, for sure, to assure leak-proof function and for easy fill up with wide mouth.",66851,4
66851,"Unfortunately, my sesame seed oil, after a week in the bottle, has developed ""rubber"" smell from the material of the bottle!.",66851,4
66852,The balls are so tightly on I can't get them off.. but everything seems nice for the price,66852,4
66853,"Bought this as a gift, they said they liked it",66853,4
66855,I believe I'm just in between sizes it's a little snug but I almost bet the next size would be too big got lots of compliments I weigh 276 pounds and I felt it accentuated the right parts and covered the right parts very pleased,66855,4
66856,It's a nice little pendant.,66856,4
66856,"It is very small, a lot smaller than I expected.",66856,4
66856,"The chain is not the best quality, but the pendant is what's important.",66856,4
66856,The glowing blue heart is the coolest part.,66856,4
66856,"Keep in mind it is a blue glow in the dark material, it will not glow if it doesn't get charged by light.",66856,4
66856,"Overall, it's a neat little pendant that most Zelda fans will like.",66856,4
66856,"Even if your not a fan of Zelda, the glowing heart is still cool.",66856,4
66857,Beautiful dress but sleeves were to tight,66857,4
66858,I purchased size 8/medium but it's running little bit large.,66858,4
66858,Color and overall appearance is very decent,66858,4
66859,"It's a great product; however, I wish it was a little bit bigger...",66859,4
66859,I'm 5'9'' 150 lbs.,66859,4
66859,The head still fits well but feels small.,66859,4
66861,"She liked it, for the cost and quick shipment it is a nice dress, light and comfortable and looks nice for a summer dress.",66861,4
66863,This is a very beautiful piece of jewelry.,66863,4
66863,It accents any outfit.,66863,4
66863,Wear it for all occasions.,66863,4
66864,I ordered a size medium.,66864,4
66864,I usually wear a size 6 in tops.,66864,4
66864,This shirt fit fine.,66864,4
66864,"It was a little long(I'm 5'9), but I just folded it under.",66864,4
66864,It was a little big and I I lost my shape a little by wearing it but I'm okay with that.,66864,4
66864,I wore it with a black t-shirt under it to work.,66864,4
66864,This shirt definitely require that something is worn underneath.,66864,4
66866,I prefer the brand Aetrex but they cost twice as much so these are a good value.,66866,4
66867,"So far, so good.",66867,4
66867,They've helped when working in New York City.,66867,4
66867,They adjust in the back and the ear portions are big enough to fit over my beats wireless earphones.,66867,4
66867,"A bit of a tight fit, regular earphones would fit more comfortably.",66867,4
66867,"I complaint and if I wear my coat hood as well, then I am cozy.",66867,4
66868,"These socks were great fitting, and very warm.",66868,4
66868,"We don't get bad winters here in NC, so when my daughter needed boots, she wore her rain boots with these for extra warmth.",66868,4
66869,I really like this shirt.,66869,4
66869,It's very cute and comfy.,66869,4
66869,"It's not quite as long as the picture makes it appear, but it's still really nice.",66869,4
66870,Shipped in a timely manner.,66870,4
66872,I bought it for work and it has great stretch to it and looked cute with wedges.,66872,4
66872,I used the size chart they provided and went with a Large since I am a 12.,66872,4
66872,It fit as expected and had great stretch.,66872,4
66872,I did not give it five stars because the arms were a bit snug.,66872,4
66872,But I just stretched them a bit and problem solved.,66872,4
66873,I like them but wear a pair of underwear under them as the seam splits my 'parts' up the middle and that looks a bit unsightly.,66873,4
66873,"other than that, I really like the fit and style.",66873,4
66875,These are very comfortable and fit nicely.,66875,4
66875,Lots of pockets (on the backside and legs) I like them for a change from jeans,66875,4
66876,"Nice shirt, order a size up from your normal size.",66876,4
66878,Nice skirt for work or play.,66878,4
66880,"Great socks, fit well, great price",66880,4
66881,This is so cute and made a great gift.,66881,4
66881,The only issue I had with it was that I wish it were made of a softer material.,66881,4
66882,Thicker material than I thought.,66882,4
66882,Pocket and bow is black not blue which is slightly a bummer.,66882,4
66883,Nice shirt and will buy more like these,66883,4
66884,I like the case works great in the dark.,66884,4
66884,But horrible protection for the phone.,66884,4
66885,The coat fit as expected.,66885,4
66885,"It is a very nice coat, a few complaints though.",66885,4
66885,First if you have medium to long hair there is a button on the back of the coat you will have to cut off( it located about the upper middle back.),66885,4
66885,It is very VERY easy for your hair to get caught and tangled around the button.,66885,4
66885,My other complaint is the quality.,66885,4
66885,I did notice some of the white lining in the coat was showing in a few areas.,66885,4
66885,It was easily fixed but still for the price I wish I didn't have to.,66885,4
66886,"It's a little longer, and a little heavier than I thought it would be.",66886,4
66887,Have had this for about a year.,66887,4
66887,I love the removable hood.,66887,4
66887,Lots of pockets for carrying crap.,66887,4
66887,"Two things prevent me from giving it five stars:
1.",66887,4
66887,"It has the appearance of oiled/waxed cotton, but it's not - it soaks up rain pretty quickly!",66887,4
66887,"But it's not advertised to be rainproof, so I cannot complain too much.",66887,4
66887,One of the pockets developed a small hole within a week.,66887,4
66887,"My wife sewed it right up, and it hasn't been a problem since.",66887,4
66887,"That being said, I like the jacket enough that I may just invest the time to wax it myself.",66887,4
66888,I love the dress but the skirt was extremely long and I'm 4'8 what i should have did was have the skirt alternated but I'm still going to wear it to my prom this saturday,66888,4
66889,Too tight for my wrist,66889,4
66890,"very nice, its a keeper",66890,4
66891,Love the print on this dress and the fabric is soft and not see through.,66891,4
66891,Its perfect for summer.,66891,4
66891,I bought the smallest size and expected it to be a little big due to the reviews.,66891,4
66891,"I am 5'-1.5"" and 108 lbs.",66891,4
66891,"and I had it shortened about 2"" to above my knee.",66891,4
66891,The arm openings are a little big but I plan on getting a pretty lace strapless bra that will look okay if a bit shows.,66891,4
66891,I am happy with the purchase and so is my husband!,66891,4
66892,I look this shirt for the most part.,66892,4
66892,"The sleeves are slightly too short & I was hoping it would cover a little more of my torso , it's stopped above my belly button & I was looking for something that would cover my belly button.",66892,4
66892,For the price though?,66892,4
66892,I would order another one.,66892,4
66893,Very cute top; easy care too.,66893,4
66894,I can fit 3 bottels of wine in here with room to spair.,66894,4
66894,I keep it in the car for an activity bag.,66894,4
66895,Normally I would have ores a xl but after reading the reviews it made me believe that I would need to order the xxl.,66895,4
66896,Fit well and is well made.,66896,4
66897,THIS BAG SURPRISED ME.,66897,4
66897,"ITS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE, NOT TOO SMALL, NOT TOO LARGE, JUST RIGHT.",66897,4
66897,"I ALSO LIKE ALL
THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE COMPARTMENTS.",66897,4
66897,"I NEED THEM, KEYS, TISSUES ETC.",66897,4
66897,SLOT INSIDE FOR YOUR CELL PHONE.,66897,4
66898,I'm usually a medium but the top part was a bit small...so if you're bustier around c to d cup I suggest you take a large..otherwise was a very sexy swimsuit,66898,4
66899,A lot of compliments on these glasses.,66899,4
66900,"This little card wallet is fine, if you have plenty of room in your handbag.",66900,4
66900,"But it's really too big for a small bag, which is what I was looking for.",66900,4
66900,"It was just as described, with plenty of pockets for cards; just a little too much for the size of my bag.",66900,4
66901,The only issue is that the box they come in is a little too small store them when not in use.,66901,4
66902,I was looking for things that would make traveling easier.,66902,4
66902,This product looks like it will fit the bill.,66902,4
66902,I think a lot of my problem with traveling is how I pack.,66902,4
66902,This product shows how to fold items on a plastic board that fits nicely into a pocket.,66902,4
66902,"Once you follow the easy instructions, you simply stack and then close the Velcro lined sides.",66902,4
66902,This ensures a snug fit that will help keep your clothes neat and tidy.,66902,4
66902,I tried a few items and they held up well.,66902,4
66902,I think this will make it possible to bring clothes other than standard cotton knit.,66902,4
66902,"If I do not have to iron, I will definitely bring more ""dressy"" blouses.",66902,4
66902,This is also great when my husband travels and needs to take his dress shirts.,66902,4
66902,So glad that I got this product and can't wait to travel again.,66902,4
66902,I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,66902,4
66903,Definitely a lot of options.,66903,4
66905,What can I say.,66905,4
66905,Fit nicely good material.,66905,4
66906,But the shirt run small,66906,4
66907,Got it as a gift for my lil bro and he loved it.,66907,4
66909,I've had and worn this consistently for a month.,66909,4
66909,"It has survived pool water, ocean water, and the daily grooming process (soap, lotions, etc) without me having to take it off.",66909,4
66909,Only taken off once after getting a pedicure and leg massage because the closure hook stretched unhooking the chain.,66909,4
66909,I pressed the s hook back together and haven't had any other issues.,66909,4
66909,The chain is great.,66909,4
66909,Hasn't faded or affected my skin in any way.,66909,4
66909,The silver color on the beads is fading which is why I give this anklet 4 stars instead of 5.,66909,4
66910,I got an XL and fit a bit small but still doable,66910,4
66911,"These shoes were great, and my son loves them!",66911,4
66911,They came on time & they were a great price .,66911,4
66911,"the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they were just a tad bit large, but its fine because he will have room for his feet to grow in them.",66911,4
66912,"Very nice, basic blouse.",66912,4
66913,"It runs a bit small, I got a medium should of got a large.",66913,4
66914,"Make my feet sweat for some reason...not very breathable, but very comfortable and good quality.",66914,4
66915,"Much shinier than expected, but they are comfortable and fit well.",66915,4
66917,Cute in the picture but in real life the pattern reminds me of prison clothes!,66917,4
66917,4 stars since fit and quality are decent.,66917,4
66917,Not sure if I'll ever wear this out but I'll keep it!,66917,4
66918,Cute dress but the bust area is small.,66918,4
66918,"I'm not a big chested person but, like many, have grown with pregnancy.",66918,4
66918,The chest area of this dress does not have enough room.,66918,4
66919,Fits good for the price.,66919,4
66919,"I am 135lbs, 5'5, and a DD.",66919,4
66919,"I ordered a medium, ot fits good.",66919,4
66920,The rest remains to be seen.,66920,4
66921,Well it is a hat!,66921,4
66922,Very feminine but returns are not something that you want to deal with.,66922,4
66923,The shirt was a little more $ than I wanted to spend.,66923,4
66923,But the shirt quality is good.,66923,4
66923,The letters are paint not embroidery.,66923,4
66923,One letter cracked and I have worn them each once.,66923,4
66923,Shall see how they look after two washings.,66923,4
66924,"The product is nice, but it did not fit me.",66924,4
66924,I had to order a larger size.,66924,4
66926,"Love this top it is really cute and made of thick material I am a 34DDD and got a size medium, it isn't as stretchy as you would think so the letters are starting to crack but with my band size didn't want to risk going up to a size large.",66926,4
66926,Other than the letters love this top !,66926,4
66927,Well made but a little tight,66927,4
66928,"Great bag, high quality materials and construction, looks exactly like the picture.",66928,4
66928,"Only draw backs are that it is rather small, which I expected, but it's kind of stiff so not a whole lot can be carried in it.",66928,4
66928,"With my wallet, cellphone, chapstick and mini planner in it, I can just close it.",66928,4
66928,"Tried to fit my keys inside, but there was no way.",66928,4
66928,"Also, the strap is on the thin side, but I've gotten nothing but compliments for it.",66928,4
66928,"Also, it's funny to hold it up next to my black cat  it looks like her!",66928,4
66929,This is a great handbag-the perfect size!,66929,4
66929,the only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the inner zipper for the middle pocket does not close properly.,66929,4
66929,"But otherwise, I love it!",66929,4
66930,Beautiful dress and fit just as expected.,66930,4
66930,However I feel you really have to have some kind of curve to your body to bring out the beauty of the dress  I don't and just felt like I did the dress no justice lol I saw reviews with heavier woman wearing it and they rocked it so it's not about being skinny or not it's just about making sure you have the body to accentuate the design of this dress.,66930,4
66930,Unfortunately I had to return it :( Quality is great.,66930,4
66930,Heavy material intricate design looks a lot more expensive that what was paid.,66930,4
66930,I pay attention to detail though and there was one black stone in a sea of crystals that peeved me.,66930,4
66930,I wonder if these dresses have small minute flaws and are sold for a cheaper price to other sellers.,66930,4
66931,Bought these for my mother.,66931,4
66931,"She loved them, but she is very short and the bottoms had to be shortened.",66931,4
66931,Otherwise the style and color were perfect for her.,66931,4
66932,It's a nice shrit!,66932,4
66932,"When I opened it,  it smelled.",66932,4
66932,"However,  it's from the traveling.",66932,4
66932,"Wash it, it be fine.",66932,4
66932,Sleeves to me seem long and I don't have short arms.,66932,4
66933,You get what you pay for and then (a little).,66933,4
66933,"It's a nice dress, coloring is a bit off and you can tell the fabric is cheap.",66933,4
66933,"The clasps look like they could fall off with some heavy wind, but if you belt it with a nice belt and maybe attach new clasps I think it would be great for a baby shower or something similar.",66933,4
66933,I'm 5'5 and 125 pounds and a medium fit really well!,66933,4
66934,Good fit and we'll made.,66934,4
66934,I ordered mine a bit large.,66934,4
66934,It was still a bit tricky to get on when I was super pregnant.,66934,4
66934,Great for a curvy figure.,66934,4
66935,Very comfortable and fit as expected.,66935,4
66935,"After first wash in a gentle machine and air drying, one pair had a couple of threads come loose, but the rest are fine so far.",66935,4
66935,True to color and look exactly as pictured.,66935,4
66936,This is very helpful when first starting to grow and needing help with your regular pants.,66936,4
66936,"It's pretty comfortable, too.",66936,4
66937,Really cute cover up.,66937,4
66937,Would be a cute dress with a slip underneath.,66937,4
66937,Sadly it is just too large for me.,66937,4
66937,Would look great on a talker or larger girl.,66937,4
66937,The lace detail is so pretty.,66937,4
66939,"But it was a tight fit for my boyfriend, But he loved it.",66939,4
66940,kinda small but cute styling took like month to get it,66940,4
66941,a bit dark and skew to vision,66941,4
66942,"I like the fabric, design and color.",66942,4
66942,"I'm 5'8"" and 145lb and the medium shirt is too short through the torso even without a big prego or post-baby belly.",66942,4
66942,It's stretchy but doesn't feel like it will hold the stretch and keep from riding up in belly/waist as things grow.,66942,4
66943,"Love them, will order more....",66943,4
66944,"Hi, a very nice warm scarf.",66944,4
66944,very nice scarf .,66944,4
66944,"UPDATE 12-30-16 , I've been using more this year and i'm glade i have it .",66944,4
66944,very warm and light .,66944,4
66945,My son loves the way they look.,66945,4
66946,Shoes were a little big on our toddler.,66946,4
66946,"She wears an 8, but these fell off of her.",66946,4
66946,Will save for future use.,66946,4
66947,Few strings here and there I cut off.,66947,4
66947,"Can't beat it for the price and it's only
For special wear.",66947,4
66947,His school pictures came out great :),66947,4
66948,Nice pair of pants I bought for hiking.,66948,4
66948,"They are about 3 inches too long for me (5'4"") but I like the fit and everything else about them.",66948,4
66949,It is a nice pocketbook it is very roomy inside enough to carry what ever you want my iPad even fits in nicely.,66949,4
66949,The quality is good it does not look cheaply made.,66949,4
66949,The outside zipper pocket is great for even an iPone 6s.,66949,4
66949,The zipper that closes the main compartment  is a little rough closing at times but has not been a real issue.,66949,4
66949,Overall it was a good buy.,66949,4
66950,fit was good just bit small in chest area.,66950,4
66951,Great support but I still feel a little bulky wearing it.,66951,4
66952,Yes.its a lovely bag and holds a lot too,66952,4
66954,I like these legging I'm 210 5'7 and they fit well on me and are thin but not see through.,66954,4
66954,They do stretch out a little but not enough to be falling off or anything.,66954,4
66954,I love the skull and roses theme too!!,66954,4
66954,I would recommend these to a friend.,66954,4
66955,Better then I thought it was going to look.,66955,4
66955,Did loose the knife though,66955,4
66956,"Nice a little see thur, But Cute Summer Outfit.",66956,4
66957,It's really cute and looks great on my charm necklace,66957,4
66958,Not a bad sock is not the ones I have been looking  for but will fit the bill until I find the ones I really want,66958,4
66959,I am currently 32 weeks pregnant & bought this for nursing so I am not planning to wear it now.,66959,4
66959,It does not fit comfortably over my belly so I can't anyway.,66959,4
66959,It should be fine post partum as it fits perfectly through the bodice.,66959,4
66959,The elastic stretches nicely to allow nursing.,66959,4
66959,I like the length; neither too short nor too long.,66959,4
66959,The fabric is a nice thickness.,66959,4
66959,It is cool & breathable but not see through.,66959,4
66959,My only reason for not giving 5 stars is because it is advertised as a maternity nightgown & it strains over my current bump.,66959,4
66960,"These are cute, the toes are a little narrow with very little stretch and the are kind or short in length.",66960,4
66960,They ARE cute and come in a 6-pack.,66960,4
66961,Not easy to fill the lighter.,66961,4
66962,I am not a tall person and this dress i think is made for tall woman.,66962,4
66962,I don't have problem about the fitting but i need to cut the length because it's way to long for a 5'2 ft. like me.,66962,4
66962,I ordered the size large.,66962,4
66962,Luckily i know how to sew so i don't need to pay other people to cut the length of this dress.,66962,4
66962,This dress is perfect for spring.,66962,4
66962,"Disclaimer
  I bought this dress and paid full price.",66962,4
66963,"Runs 2 sizes to small, but great quality.",66963,4
66964,Very pleased with my purchase for a bed bound friend in nursing home.,66964,4
66964,I want the exact same thing in different colors.,66964,4
66964,"I have not
Washed it yet but the quality of the material looks and feels so good and size as expected .",66964,4
66964,I only see product in pink.,66964,4
66964,I am going to research Amerimark for white,66964,4
66966,I love this costume!,66966,4
66967,"Beautiful hat, order a xxl and is a bit snug but I'm sure it wiil stretch a bit.",66967,4
66968,"Cute but a little big, baggy on the bottom.",66968,4
66968,I am a s/xs,66968,4
66969,This blouse is really cute and pretty versatile.,66969,4
66969,I usually wear it by layering under a spaghetti-strap floral dress for a kawaii look.,66969,4
66969,"I have not worn it to work yet, simply because the blouse is quite sheer.",66969,4
66969,"Pretty much all of my bras (including nude and white bras) are visible through the blouse, so I would have to layer a cami underneath if I wanted to wear it with a skirt.",66969,4
66969,"This is the main drawback for me because I wanted to wear this solo in hot weather, but what is the point if I have to wear another layer with it?",66969,4
66969,The cut of the blouse is quite generous too.,66969,4
66969,"It is not a tight fitting blouse at all, but I think that is supposed to be the style.",66969,4
66969,"Overall, I'd recommend as a layering piece.",66969,4
66970,would have given this product 5 stars but I have only had it a a little over a week so cannot say anything about durability.,66970,4
66970,The only problem I have had is being asked why I have a cigarette case!,66970,4
66970,The case is good looking and holds a reasonable number of cards.,66970,4
66970,I would not like it any thicker.,66970,4
66970,It appears to be well made.,66970,4
66970,Delivery was very quick.,66970,4
66970,Amazon packaging was excessive.,66970,4
66971,"Very beautiful outfit, but it's a little big for the size of 18mos.",66971,4
66971,I would buy it again but a size smaller,66971,4
66972,I actually was pleased enough with the first extra extra long tie that I went back and bought a second one.,66972,4
66972,"I'm not super tall, but I have a long torso and am a bigger (round) guy.",66972,4
66972,These are the first ties that I have found that go all the way down to the belt line AND I can tuck the back of the tie into the tie loop.,66972,4
66972,"Something I have not been able to do for a long, long time.",66972,4
66972,"In my opinion, these ties don't look high-end, but they do the job.",66972,4
66973,Very sexy bathing suit but it does run small.,66973,4
66973,I'm 5'5 and weight 145lb and ordered a medium.,66973,4
66973,It fit well but good thing because I don't have big boobs..,66973,4
66973,If you're a person that does..,66973,4
66973,I recommend going 2 size up.,66973,4
66975,"I like them, they just look alike Chistian Dior Technologic sunglasses",66975,4
66976,Hoodie w extra room,66976,4
66978,This item was purchased for a 1970s interactive play which is scheduled for August.,66978,4
66978,I  wish I could give this item 5 stars.,66978,4
66978,The fit is perfect but this item is made for a much taller person.,66978,4
66978,I am 5'3 wearing platforms and they are still too long.,66978,4
66978,I will alter pant legs and use fabric to make a headband.,66978,4
66978,I will have to wear dark hose because the garment is thin.,66978,4
66978,Color and style is just what I was looking for.,66978,4
66979,"The stitching at the top is questionable but for under two dollars, it's worth it.",66979,4
66980,Surprisingly soft and flattering for a novelty tank.,66980,4
66981,"Excellent quality, however the fit was a bit small for my face.",66981,4
66981,I still consider them to be one of my all time favorites.,66981,4
66982,Very nice look and doesn't appear to be a conceal carry bag when looking at it and my pistol fits nicely going into the specially built pouch area.,66982,4
66982,However that said their design could seriously use some improvement.,66982,4
66982,"When my gun is in there it wants to tilt down because the lining isn't sewn to the outer purse ""leather"".",66982,4
66982,Additionally if I was looking for a quick draw it wouldn't work for the same reason and this also causes the gun to hang up on the material when coming out.,66982,4
66982,I'm going to secure mine myself and also line the pocket with a hard plastic to facilitate it holding position better.,66982,4
66983,"This runs small,i'm 5 3 140,and it just fit's me.",66983,4
66984,"Cute, get lots of compliments but sort of heavy on my neck.",66984,4
66984,Can't wear all day but perfect for a special outfit.,66984,4
66984,Looks great with several tops and colors.,66984,4
66985,Very bright colors but runs small.,66985,4
66985,Great with shorts on the beach.,66985,4
66986,This is my very first corset and for a first it was excellent.,66986,4
66986,I'm very happy and I figured it would run a little small because I didn't know exactly what size to order.,66986,4
66986,Also it doesn't work too well with larger breasts.,66986,4
66986,Especially if it is you're waist isn't proportional to your chest.,66986,4
66986,So if you have a smaller waist with a large chest area order a size bigger.,66986,4
66986,Otherwise very amazing and great for the price.,66986,4
66988,I bought this to wear during a mud run race.,66988,4
66988,The shirt worked great for the race and the color looked nice.,66988,4
66988,The material wicked away the sweat during the race and kept me cool.,66988,4
66989,I ordered a large because I read that it runs small...I normally wear a medium and it fits great.,66989,4
66989,"I'm 5'8"" and the length is fine",66989,4
66990,I need to buy another one because I scratched one of the lenses already.,66990,4
66990,I like the shape.,66990,4
66991,I am 6ft tall and 155# I ordered an XL because I saw that it ran small from other reviews.,66991,4
66991,the top fits really nice but the bottoms are sooo awkward.,66991,4
66991,They are too small and the hole between the 2 side bands is really weird.,66991,4
66991,It's like a little place for my hip fat to smush through!,66991,4
66991,The bottoms don't really cover my butt very well either.,66991,4
66991,I will just be wearing another matching bottom that I have from another suit.,66991,4
66992,CLEVERLY EXECUTED FOR HOLDING SMALL BOTTLES OF TESTING MATERIAL AND SLATE.,66992,4
66992,"IF I CAN THINK OF ANOTHER REASON I NEED ANOTHER BOX OR TWO, I'LL BE BUYING MORE.",66992,4
66994,This tank was too small for my husband.,66994,4
66994,"It's very simple - no markings or brands shown anywhere, just plain yellow.",66994,4
66994,"It just runs small, so be aware of that.",66994,4
66994,"Material is cotton, so it will also shrink even more after you wash it.",66994,4
66994,I would get a size larger than you normally wear.,66994,4
66995,They were smaller than I expected but look just like the picture so I'm not too disappointed.,66995,4
66995,The earrings stay on and don't hurt my ears.,66995,4
66995,"They aren't heavy and the paint hasn't chipped or worn off yet, so overall, I'm satisfied.",66995,4
66996,wish it was one size larger because it is so cute.,66996,4
66997,If you have a short torso this shirt is for you.,66997,4
66997,"I, however, have a taller torso so this shirt is very short on me.",66997,4
66997,"It fits me width wise, but not in length.",66997,4
66997,"High quality image, though!",66997,4
66997,A very cute sleeveless shirt.,66997,4
66998,My bf finds them very attractive so I've ordered them in most colors & I wear them all the time!,66998,4
66998,Contours to my body very nicely but still very comfortable!,66998,4
66999,Wore it for my birthday and I was super fly,66999,4
67000,Size was a little small but otherwise a nice hat..,67000,4
67001,it's a great case I got the 'Chill Pills' everything looks fine and dandy for now I just got it today it's like 20 days early so that's awesome !,67001,4
67001,super snug perfect fit.,67001,4
67001,I feel like buying this case is a hit or miss you'll probably luck out and get a good quality one but s*** always happens.,67001,4
67001,definitely read the review for the one you specially want.,67001,4
67002,Sister in-law loved it.,67002,4
67002,Only complaint is that it came in an earring case.,67002,4
67002,Had to cut that off before wrapping.,67002,4
67003,looks cute fits great.,67003,4
67003,fits like i though it would and looks super cute,67003,4
67005,"Seam in the center looks funky, but I love the look!",67005,4
67006,This one is actually functional.,67006,4
67006,I was using similar design in smaller size and became very frustrated with it.,67006,4
67006,"Only negative, if all slots are filled with credit cards, it is too tight.",67006,4
67006,I use every other one and it closes fine.,67006,4
67006,Nice to have bright colors to locate easily in a handbag!,67006,4
67006,I'd buy it again.,67006,4
67007,Will get a size lsrgrr next time..but overall nice,67007,4
67008,Comfy and quick fit for the wifey.,67008,4
67008,Love watching her walk around the house with this on.,67008,4
67009,little narrow for 3E but will work,67009,4
67010,"Nice material, very tight.",67010,4
67010,"One size fits all, but extremely snug and I am a size 6-8.",67010,4
67012,"great item if you're a boondocks saints fan, lighter than I expected but nice none the less",67012,4
67014,Larger than I expected but still fits very well in my small purse.,67014,4
67014,"Love the color, works great for me, suits me just fine.",67014,4
67014,If I ever wear it out I would purchase it again.,67014,4
67015,I like my hats very much but it si a little loose on my head.,67015,4
67015,It looks well made and the classic look never goes out of style.,67015,4
67016,I really like these!,67016,4
67016,I think my only critique is that I wish they were shorter - they're almost the length of shorts vs underwear which is what I was wanting.,67016,4
67016,"But, still very very cute.",67016,4
67017,Good quality for the price.,67017,4
67017,We were pleasantly surprised.,67017,4
67018,"My son is 3 years old, fits him good but the sleeves are long but we knew that would be the case since its for ages 4-6, he will just grow into it.",67018,4
67018,"The material is good, it doesn't feel cheap.",67018,4
67018,Were happy with the purchase.,67018,4

67022,Love the mixed colors.,67022,4
67023,"My daughter loved it because she loves the movie, but I thought it fit smaller than expected.",67023,4

67023,"Glad I did, otherwise it would have been too tight.",67023,4
67023,But she's happy with it!,67023,4
67025,I've been wearing these for two weeks now through about thirty racquetball games.,67025,4
67025,"They fit great, have good grip, and are comfortable with the cushioned socks I wear.",67025,4
67025,"They do have a unique square looking toe which was unexpected, but not noticeably different in fit or performance.",67025,4
67026,As a Rockwell Retiree always looking for memorabilia.,67026,4
67027,Bigger than what I expected but well made.,67027,4
67028,"I'm a 32-24-36, the top was wrinkly,  probably because of shipping, it came with a bottom so I was really excited I thought it was just the top!",67028,4
67028,Bottom was snug because I have a big butt.,67028,4
67028,Over all you get what you pay for.,67028,4
67028,I wear 34b in bra.,67028,4
67029,"It seems a little small for a newborn, we got a couple cute pictures in before it would slide up and eventually off.",67029,4
67029,"Keep it around for a little, it fits better as they grow a little and I enjoy getting some use out of it.",67029,4

67034,"Very nice hat, looks good with my short hair.",67034,4
67034,Will be nice for sunny days out.,67034,4

67036,I usually by muisol dresses xxl and they fit perfect.,67036,4
67036,Bought a xxl in this dress and its too big.,67036,4

67037,Runs small but very good quality.,67037,4
67038,I really like this!,67038,4
67038,"However, I have thick thighs (though nothing unusual) and so the leg openings were too tight on me.",67038,4
67038,The high waist is super flattering and cute and unusual.,67038,4
67038,"I am 5'4"", 185 lbs, size 14, curvy/round, I got 2XL which fit everywhere except the thigh/leg openings.",67038,4
67038,I would suggest one size up (two sizes if you have big thighs).,67038,4
67038,"I got this to wear to an adult themed party, which it would be super cute for except two things:

1 - leg holes way too tight for comfortable wear even for an hour or two
2 - my larger read end ""spills"" over the bottom straps under the rear, hiding them, making it look like I'm just not wearing anything from behind.",67038,4
67038,Thicker 'straps' or fabric areas under rear in back would improve this.,67038,4
67039,"this hat is not oversized, at all, but I like how its fits.",67039,4
67040,wish they were polished,67040,4
67041,Love my necklace makes me look mysterious,67041,4

67042,"I'm a curvy gal with healthy hips and thighs, and didn't have a problem with the legs rolling up like other reviewers noted.",67042,4
67042,"I prefer swimdresses, since I have two small kids and don't always have the time to change in/out of my own swimsuit after swimming without someone running away from me.",67042,4
67042,I can put a towel on my drivers' seat and don't feel underdressed walking into a store or running errands before/after swim time.,67042,4

67042,I have now worn it a few times and have received many compliments on it.,67042,4
67042,"The stitching doesn't stretch super well, but doesn't seem to be coming undone.",67042,4
67042,"If it lasts through the summer, it's definitely worth the price!",67042,4
67043,Just looking at the picture I bought this thinking it'd be a regular necklace pendant size.,67043,4

67044,I got exactly what I paid for.,67044,4
67044,It's see through due to the material type but it fits fine.,67044,4

67046,Love that this supports Bernie's campaign,67046,4

67048,The size L fits like a size L should.,67048,4
67048,"I couldn't order a M because they were out of stock, but I figured the L would fit correctly since everyone was complaining about these things running small.",67048,4
67048,I had to pin it and tie it to get a slimmer fit from it.,67048,4
67048,"Also I will note that the color ""brown"" is inaccurate.",67048,4
67048,"I went based purely on the pictures, which show gold filigree and navy.",67048,4
67048,Gold and navy is a more accurate description.,67048,4
67048,There is no brown in this whatsoever.,67048,4
67048,"That said, if you use your eyes, you won't have a problem.",67048,4
67048,"I actually knew I wanted gold and navy, and the images portrayed exactly what I received.",67048,4

67050,I ordered a M and it fits well.,67050,4
67050,"I'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs.",67050,4
67050,I prefer things more fitted so if you're similar and like it looser go with a L. I'm glad I didn't listen to other reviews about it being small.,67050,4
67050,I have issues with flowy shirts with my body type.,67050,4
67050,Anything clingy tends to accentuate my mommy of 4 tummy (no thanks!).,67050,4
67050,This one is actually pretty good as it is tighter up top to my natural waist to give me some definition.,67050,4
67050,It is a little longer in the front than the back.,67050,4
67050,I wish it were more even since it doesn't cover my bum unless I keep pulling it down.,67050,4
67050,"I'm not sure why this shirt didn't get better reviews, I really like it and I'm picky.",67050,4
67051,I bought these for my 4 month old son (who is now 6 months old.),67051,4
67051,I really like them.,67051,4
67051,They are cute and fit well.,67051,4
67051,The material is very soft.,67051,4

67059,"Runs a little small,like a top shirt rather then a dress,but I do like the fit",67059,4
67060,Greta piece of luggage!,67060,4
67060,It was a gift for my son and he loves it.,67060,4
67060,Light weight and durable!,67060,4
67061,"Everything is fine, but the color is too bright for wine color.",67061,4
67061,I wanted a little darker.,67061,4
67061,Other than that it is a beautiful hat.,67061,4
67062,"Ok, so the dress as a whole fit beautifully, and I love the fabric and color.",67062,4
67062,"HOWEVER -- the amount of fabric allotted to cover the boobs would have been skimpy for an A-cup, let alone a pregnant woman.",67062,4
67062,I ended up just cutting out the tag and wearing it backwards.,67062,4
67063,Be nice to have intructions operation and settings,67063,4
67064,I ordered these leggings for a Halloween costume.,67064,4
67064,They did the trick and were a wonderful orange-red color.,67064,4
67064,The material is VERY stretchy and comfortable to wear.,67064,4
67064,My only issue was that the leggings were a little baggy for me around the ankles.,67064,4
67064,I typically wear a size small.,67064,4
67064,However since I wore them with boots the sizing was not an issue.,67064,4
67064,Plus having prime delivery was a definite plus.,67064,4
67065,I had an issue with the first (the light didn't work) but they replaced quickly,67065,4
67066,"The top is gorgeous, but it fits somewhat larger than expected.",67066,4
67066,"As a 40DD, I ordered a 14 and had to wear it on the tightest loop and still wished it was a bit tighter.",67066,4
67066,The bottoms fit true to size.,67066,4
67066,I wore it to the beach and everything stayed put in and out of the water.,67066,4
67066,It's a very sexy bikini---the hubs loved it!,67066,4
67067,Got a hole after a week and had to stitch up.,67067,4
67068,"It was transparent, and I cut off the little pom-poms that were on the sleeves.",67068,4
67068,It's so sort I wouldn't wear it even as a mini dress.,67068,4
67068,"I'm 5'4, 145 lbs., and got a medium.",67068,4
67068,"I don't mind the transparency, a tank top fixed that, but the length was my main issue.",67068,4
67068,"It goes past my stomach, but it might as well of just been a long blouse.",67068,4
67068,I had wanted to wear it with skinny jeans and boots.,67068,4
67068,"Over all it's still cute, and it fits as a blouse.",67068,4
67068,I like it as an outfit maker with a jacket.,67068,4

67069,Order  another one in brown.,67069,4
67071,If you have a skinny wrist it will fit.,67071,4
67071,Very nice leather and stitching.,67071,4
67072,Had surgery few years ago and doctor recommended I use this.,67072,4
67072,They helped with the healing and I liked them because the material is not hot.,67072,4
67073,Roomy and comfortable but not too big at all.,67073,4
67073,Really like this shirt.,67073,4
67074,Although I love this purse the weather is great it's a little bit heavy for me when my all my items are in the purse,67074,4
67075,Clamps will leave marks on light colors.,67075,4
67077,Just what we wanted.,67077,4
67078,Fit small and definitely shrink with washing.,67078,4
67078,Ordering up a size might be advisable.,67078,4

67081,I need to return it.,67081,4
67081,The arms are to short for me.,67081,4
67081,But it looks like a great coat.,67081,4

67083,Have received tons of complaiments.,67083,4
67084,Takes 2 hands to remove a card but it is the smallest mini-wallet that Ive ever seen.,67084,4
67084,10 credit cards max.,67084,4
67084,"If you're looking for a small flat wallet, i haven't found one better than this.",67084,4
67085,"This is a cute, comfortable top, great with leggings.",67085,4
67085,"I'm 5' 1"" and it comes a couple inches above my knees.",67085,4
67085,"The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the arm holes are big enough to show the sides of my bra, basically restricting it to casual use with a sports bra.",67085,4
67086,Cute dress but the slits are high,67086,4
67087,The jacket is a litlle long unlike the model.,67087,4
67088,Liked all the colors,67088,4
67089,This was nicer than I had expected.,67089,4
67089,My son loves it,67089,4

67091,Its decent quality for the price.,67091,4
67092,"Love these pants, great for the week-end.",67092,4
67093,too long should have petite sizing avaliable,67093,4
67094,Free Peopke never seems to disappoint.,67094,4
67094,I generally wear a small in shirts and ordered that size in this style.,67094,4
67094,"Had they offered an extra small, it may have been a better choice.",67094,4
67094,"The shoulders of this style are somewhat large, but the rest fits perfectly.",67094,4
67094,"I am keeping the shirt as it still looks good, but I do need to wear a layer beneath it to keep the style a little more modest in the bust.",67094,4
67094,"The lace detail is adorable, and have ordered another in this style in a different color, but found it in the smaller size.",67094,4
67095,Been looking for one of these for a while to fit in my small purse.,67095,4
67096,"I have two sets for winter, and they worked wonders as an under layer during the coldest of days!",67096,4
67097,They are a little thin,67097,4
67098,"This is a very nice, very modest, full coverage swim suit perfect for a larger shape body.",67098,4
67098,I am a size 14 and it covers all I want it to cover but is not too much material.,67098,4
67098,It has boy shorts not bikini bottoms which I also really liked.,67098,4
67098,Would recommend this for anyone with larger shape or looking for modest swim suit.,67098,4
67099,The onesie itself is very soft and feels pretty luxurious but it wasn't as baggy as I expected.,67099,4
67099,The butt zipper part is also more apparent than I would have liked it to be but overall pretty satisfied with the product.,67099,4
67099,No outstanding damage upon arrival and came with a nice note :),67099,4
67100,"I'm confused by the reviews referring to pants here... this is most definitely a top :)
It is defn sheer, which you can tell in the image, but I think it's perfect to hide some flaws while still highlighting your curves.",67100,4
67100,"It is likely to end up rather wrinkled when packed however, so be prepared - I'll probably hang it in the bathroom when I shower once I get to my destination before I can wear it.",67100,4
67100,The extra good thing about this being thin and light is that it will take up virtually no space in my packed bag.,67100,4
67101,Strap broke few months after using,67101,4
67102,I love the colors and fabric but it does run large.,67102,4
67103,The stitching was a little off on the logo.,67103,4
67104,This is the most fashionable jacket ever!!!,67104,4
67104,This is a must have for those who love to be in style!!,67104,4
67104,It runs small however.,67104,4
67104,I absolutely love it!,67104,4
67104,Properly shipped and arrived on time.,67104,4
67106,It's a good quality.,67106,4
67106,I'd recommend this outfit,67106,4

67108,I really like the color and the fit!,67108,4
67109,"Did its job, but broke right after the proposal.",67109,4
67109,"The lights over shoots a little, but still looks great if proposing in a dim light setting.",67109,4
67111,its right for a baby,67111,4
67112,Beautiful color and well made.,67112,4
67112,"But it wasn't big enough for my new 12"" MacBook.",67112,4
67112,Had to return it.,67112,4
67113,Love the feel of this dress!,67113,4
67113,The top portion is rather sheer so I'm going to have a thin liner sewn in and have to have the hip are of the skirt portion taken in as I was sadly not blessed with curves.,67113,4
67113,Minor items considering that the price cannot be beat!!,67113,4
67113,My package arrived in good condition and earlier than expected.,67113,4
67113,I will definitely purchase from this vendor again!,67113,4
67114,It's a nice shirt but its compressed.,67114,4
67114,I usually go for loose clothes not really that bad of a shirt though.,67114,4
67115,A decent crew neck...,67115,4
67115,"I wish I had known what the inside material was like before I bought it as it's a little too fleecey, but it's all good.",67115,4
67117,It came a day earlier.,67117,4
67117,"It fits well except, it's slightly see-through on the bottom half of the dress.",67117,4
67118,Fits great and looks super cute over a bikini.,67118,4
67118,I love how the back is completely sheer.,67118,4
67118,"Gave it 4 stars instead of 5, because it was several loose strings on it.",67118,4
67121,Very cute and I received lots of compliments already.,67121,4
67121,It didn't get 5 stars because both my boyfriend and I had to fight with the clasp for it to open.,67121,4
67122,Great look but build too wide for even normal sized heads,67122,4
67123,A major issue with the bracelet is the clasp falls off easily.,67123,4
67123,Which is super annoying.,67123,4
67123,Otherwise it would have been a 5 star product for me.,67123,4
67124,"Fits like a glove, comfortable, and yet very professional looking.",67124,4
67124,It is very flattering as well.,67124,4
67124,Just what I was looking for.,67124,4
67126,"I don't care for the ""chin guard"".",67126,4
67126,"I hung it up to get the wrinkles out, but I'm going to wash and dry it.",67126,4
67126,I like the black trim.,67126,4
67126,"I appreciate that it is a combination of synthetic and cotton materials (which makes it ""eco-friendly"".)",67126,4
67127,Its great love it!!,67127,4
67128,Ordered a M I usually wear S or XS.,67128,4
67128,Though I was disappointed that it came with a stain on it.,67128,4
67128,It looks better but still there.,67128,4
67129,"Although it is beautiful, it is much smaller than I expected.",67129,4
67129,The watch is approx the diameter of a quarter.,67129,4
67129,It would have been helpful to see a photo of this held in a hand so that the buyer could get a sense of size/perspective.,67129,4
67130,"This is VERY tight, but I think it's supposed to be.",67130,4
67130,"I'm 5'3 130lbs and got a medium, and it's still a little constrictive.",67130,4
67130,"The good thing about it is that it smooths out all your lumps and bumps, like Spanx.",67130,4
67130,"I wouldn't wear this to the office or during the day, but it's great for a party or date night.",67130,4
67131,"I love these don't get me wrong, but it's a bit pricey for 2shirts.",67131,4
67134,I love this sweater.,67134,4
67134,I usually wear a xs or small and this fit pretty much perfectly.,67134,4
67134,"It's pretty stretchy and wide, but short in length.",67134,4
67134,"The only complaint I have is that the sleeves are sewed down on the sides of the sweater, but it's not a big deal.",67134,4
67134,Overall it's very lovely and I've gotten lots of complements on it.,67134,4
67136,"The presentation is beautiful, in the box and the Buddha is better than I imagined.the necklace make it all perfect.",67136,4
67137,Being at an age that I don't want my thighs showing these work wonderful for my aqua therapy.,67137,4
67138,The shirt is really cute.,67138,4
67138,I got a 3x even though I wear either a 2x and 3x depending on the cut of the shirt.,67138,4
67138,"I'm glad I did because although it fits correctly, it is just a tad tighter than I like my tee shirts.",67138,4
67138,"Also for those who like a longer tee shirt, I am 5ft 10 in and the hem of shirt comes to my fingertips.",67138,4
67140,It's a very nice hat for the price.,67140,4
67140,The quality matches the price if that makes any sense.,67140,4
67140,"It does feel a little cheap, but it's a running hat.",67140,4
67140,Not too picky here.,67140,4
67140,It clasps nice on the back and fits well.,67140,4
67140,The inside is made from mesh which sort of looks like the inner brief of a running short.,67140,4
67140,"There is no ventilation on the top though, but that is OK.",67140,4
67140,It's thin enough that the sweat will dissipate in thin air.,67140,4
67140,Grab one for the price!,67140,4
67141,"Bought as a gift for my sister after she saw the one I bought for my mom (different color ) Just the right size for your cards, money , change , keys and a few other small items .",67141,4
67141,Great for running in the store and carrying on walks or out to dinner etc...when you don't need a large purse .,67141,4
67141,"Plus what I liked the most is you can pull it up your arm when walking the dogs  or running  , It has elastic band  to hold in place or you can just carry it like a small cross body bag .",67141,4
67141,They are cute too .Wish the had more multiple color schemes like the one I bought my mother .,67141,4
67142,Unfortunately the XL was too small for me by far so I gave it to my little sister (both chronologically and physically) who states she loves the shirt.,67142,4
67142,It's made out of thin material that looks nice on her.,67142,4
67142,I am a US 16-18 and think this is probably meant for a size 10-12.,67142,4
67142,I hate my upper arms and love the look of the 3/4 length sleeve.,67142,4
67142,"I would recommend buying up a size, otherwise super cute casual top.",67142,4
67143,"I like the color combo, different then what I've seen anywhere.",67143,4
67143,Heavy duty glasses..overall I like them.,67143,4
67144,The bottoms are a little revealing for my 13 year old but she loves the top,67144,4
67145,its a great dress.,67145,4
67145,however when ordering order one size down.,67145,4
67146,I loved this dress!,67146,4
67146,It fits well and is just the kind of dress I wanted!,67146,4
67146,"My only problem was when I washed it, according to the tag, I added in one of those color absorbing clothes and the maroon bleed out onto the white and turned it pink!",67146,4
67146,I will still wear it but super bummed it didn't stay white!,67146,4
67147,I got this in XXL and it's still too small.,67147,4
67147,It would probably fit better if it didn't have so much fluffy insulation on the inside.,67147,4
67147,"I am able to zip it up, but I'm not able to layer underneath it like I wanted to.",67147,4
67147,Order it at least 2 sizes bigger than you usually get something,67147,4
67148,"It's been a year or two, and they still haven't broken (she notorious for breaking sunglasses).",67148,4
67149,It is a great product and works perfectly for most tables.,67149,4
67149,"If the table has a roundd top edge however, it is not able to grip enough of the table surface to hold the purse.",67149,4
67150,Not sure about the zipper it seems to get stuck.,67150,4
67150,But I like the feel and weight of the pants so am keeping it,67150,4
67151,The length of shaft is a little short but it fits and is absolutely beautiful,67151,4
67152,Be cause fit good,67152,4
67153,Nice skirt and material.. should have gotten a larger size,67153,4
67154,Zipper is very difficult.,67154,4
67154,Should go up a size to fit.,67154,4
67154,Sash is disproportionate (needs to be pinned).,67154,4
67155,Used this for my lumberjack Halloween costume last year.,67155,4
67155,It was prop that was pretty easy to carry around.,67155,4
67155,Its about exactly as it is in the picture.,67155,4
67155,The blood looks kind of weird but it doesn't really matter.,67155,4
67156,"As always, doing business with Amazon is just great.",67156,4
67156,I purchased this item from Huangqian and decided that i didn't want it.,67156,4
67156,They in turn told me to keep this item free of charge because returning it would be expensive.,67156,4
67156,This decision was unexpected and a surprise.,67156,4
67156,"The outcome was much appreciated.............thank you again, Huangqian, a great way to do business....Lenore",67156,4
67157,Tight in the arms,67157,4
67158,I like it a lot.,67158,4
67158,I just wish the necklace piece was bigger.,67158,4
67159,They are very comfortable.,67159,4
67159,They ride down a tad bit.,67159,4
67159,They offer no support so  everything shows.,67159,4
67161,"The straps come off from time to time, but they are good because they save time and are easy to adjust.",67161,4
67163,I'm 5 months pregnant and I think it looks good.,67163,4
67163,I have a larger bust though (DD).,67163,4
67163,Will probably need to wear an additional tank underneath for a more modest look.,67163,4
67163,"If you have a smaller bust, probably not an issue.",67163,4
67165,"I was afraid at first the bar would be too short after I read the reviews, but they ended up being the perfect length for me.",67165,4
67165,"The balls were a little bigger than expected, but other than that I'm pretty satisfied with these.",67165,4
67166,The material is nice.,67166,4
67166,It does run a little small.,67166,4
67166,I ordered an XL instead of L and it fits fine.,67166,4
67166,"If you are larger than a C cup,  it may be tight.",67166,4
67166,It's a pretty short that will hold up when washed.,67166,4
67167,"I'm a size 6 in women's shoes, so I got a small in this shoe.",67167,4
67167,"It fit, a little tightly however, but next time I would probably get a medium.",67167,4
67167,It was still comfy since it is a slipper.,67167,4
67168,I've had no problems with these.,67168,4
67168,"The ball on the end could be a little bigger to keep them in, but they are definitely good for the price",67168,4
67169,I am pulling them up throughout the day.,67169,4
67169,Maybe it is my shape that doesn't keep them up.,67169,4
67170,"I wish i could have found one with a better design, but this is a great knit cap.",67170,4
67171,I used the old school button type garters years ago in the service.,67171,4
67171,"These are much better, and work as advertised.",67171,4
67171,The only thing preventing a five star rating is the clips sometimes slip off if I extend my leg fully when driving (clutch work).,67171,4
67172,Just a little short for my taste,67172,4
67173,"I am 5'4, 166LB, bust 36B, I ordered a Large and it seemed a bit loose.",67173,4
67173,"I liked the colors and the style, but it looked a little too cheap for, so I returned it.",67173,4
67173,"That does not change the fact it is still a cute dress, if you're not a picky gal, I am sure you will love it!",67173,4
67174,I love it so much I went back to order another and found them to be priced nearly fifteen dollars MORE than I paid.,67174,4
67174,I'll have to think on that.,67174,4
67174,Nice light (but not too think) 100%cotton.,67174,4
67174,Simple but well made>all the facings are stitched down.,67174,4
67174,Sleeves are nice and loose as described.,67174,4
67174,"If these loungers were priced at $28, I'd be purchasing more .... and giving five stars :)",67174,4
67175,Looks great on the wife!,67175,4
67176,Shorts are very short and show a little bit of butt and the shirt shows some side boob.,67176,4
67177,Fast delivery and is what was described.,67177,4
67178,"Now that Dopp has shaved some excess leather off the dimensions of this wallet, it's probably about the best front pocket wallets out there, and I've tried dozens of them  I carry one card apiece in each of the 3 main slots and 2 in the middle slot, with cash, receipts and some business cards in the large open slot.",67178,4
67178,"You could easily tuck 2 cards each in the 3 main slots if you want to fiddle more with getting them out, and you'd still not have a lot of bulk to this wallet.",67178,4
67178,"The leather is good quality, as is the stitching.",67178,4
67179,"Looking good, I love it.",67179,4
67181,its an ok tank top.,67181,4
67181,Material is a little heavy and hot but i used it as a workout tank.,67181,4
67181,Its pretty cheaply made  but it will serve its purpose.,67181,4
67182,The inside seam is ripping from the zipper the wallet was replaced and I am satisfied,67182,4
67183,Nice hat runs small,67183,4
67184,We have about a dozen of these various masks that we wear for fun.,67184,4
67184,"(my 4 kids and I wear them on family walks lol) Most all of them have visibility issues and are too uncomfortable for any prolonged use, and this one is no different, but hey, they're just for fun, right?",67184,4
67186,Im in the learning process of how and when ro use it...,67186,4
67187,"The neck line is a little larger than I wanted, but love the dress.",67187,4
67187,"Great quality, length,  and fit.",67187,4
67187,I bought it for my mother who normally wears am 18 or 20.,67187,4
67189,aside from the metal oxidizing and turning a brownish color it is really nice I've had it for over 6 months and it still glows just fine important note the material inside only glows after being exposed to light,67189,4
67190,Pretty and as expected,67190,4
67192,starts falling apart after a year,67192,4
67193,"The dress is beautiful, but the fit is a little odd.",67193,4
67193,If I had a longer torso it would probably fit better.,67193,4
67193,I went by the size chart and will need to have it tailored down in the shoulder and bust.,67193,4
67193,"I am 5'4"", 165lbs, 38D and ordered the XL, but the entire top is baggy and unwearable.",67193,4
67193,"That said, it's gorgeous and with some tailoring it will be beautiful and flattering.",67193,4
67194,I loved this shirt when I saw it and had to purchase it for my daughter.,67194,4
67194,My only complaint is that the material is a bit thinner than I thought it would be.,67194,4
67194,It's very cool though.,67194,4
67194,The colors are vivid and it's very unique.,67194,4
67195,This skirt is gorgeous!,67195,4
67195,It looks better in person than the picture and is definitely worth the purchase.,67195,4
67195,I received it very quickly in the mail.,67195,4
67195,I'm so glad I got this skirt,67195,4
67196,"This shirt has the look an feel of an iron-on, and while it survived one accidental trip through the dryer unscathed, I would suggest washing it inside-out and air-drying.",67196,4
67196,"Aside from the printing quality, this shirt looks great and has garnered lots of nice comments.",67196,4
67196,"Shipping is a bit steep, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase.",67196,4
67198,perfect size and nice size is just right for me waiting on the dress to see if it all works!,67198,4
67199,I like this very attractive but the area to write your name and contact details is easily damage.,67199,4
67199,I improvised and use my own cardboard to replaced that part.,67199,4
67200,Really nice but extremely see through.,67200,4
67200,Do not buy if you are self conscious because this dress will show EVERYTHING.,67200,4
67201,I like the style and fabric.,67201,4
67202,"The brim is really long, but the fit is as expected.",67202,4
67203,I am a small before so this time a bought mediums.,67203,4
67203,The pants all fit but now the tops are tight  But I love them so I really can't complain except for that.,67203,4
67204,Little bigger than I expected but still beautiful chiffon like material.,67204,4
67205,These are very fun and I look forward to wearing it!,67205,4
67205,One of the globes separated from the pendant (perhaps in the shipping) but I was able to superglue it back on.,67205,4
67205,Hoping it will hold.,67205,4
67205,This will make me happy being able to take me to the beach just by looking at it.,67205,4
67206,wish they had others colors to buy.,67206,4
67207,I read the reviews & ordered one size up.,67207,4
67207,"I got the L, but I'm normally a M.  I haven't washed it yet, so I don't know how long it will last.",67207,4
67208,The material is slightly see through.,67208,4
67208,With tights it worked Perfectly!,67208,4
67210,OK for a tee shirt.,67210,4
67211,"Wish they had a little more support/cushion, but I love everything else about them!",67211,4
67213,This ring is extremely cute and a good fit.,67213,4
67213,The wire is thin so it doesn't bother me too much to wear.,67213,4
67213,The package arrived within only a few days and I haven't had any problems,67213,4
67214,The upper portion fits really well.,67214,4
67214,The shirt is a bit long for me which is the only thing I could pick on.,67214,4
67214,Overall a great print quality and the black provides the perfect contrast.,67214,4
67215,perfect for that special surprise after a night out with the hubby!,67215,4
67215,comfy and love the way they come down lower than most - sexy!!,67215,4
67215,they were a little bigger than the size stated so order smaller.....,67215,4
67216,Cute and I sized up but great fit!,67216,4
67217,Is a great quality....,67217,4
67218,Good quality for the price,67218,4
67219,It's a great ankle bracelet but not for me.,67219,4
67219,I have huge/wide (or chubby) ankles && had to give it to my mother in law :(,67219,4
67220,It takes about 2-3 weeks to arrive.,67220,4
67220,I lost the chain that hangs under the flower I don't know whether that has something to do with it being cheap or me being careless.,67220,4
67220,"Also, The plastic is very fragile as well.",67220,4
67220,But you get what you pay for I guess.,67220,4
67221,This dress was a welcome change for a nursing momma.,67221,4
67221,"The fabric is a little see through on the bottom part of the dress, but was pretty forgiving with hiding the post baby tummy.",67221,4
67221,The top is very comfortable and a cotton stretch material.,67221,4
67221,I would not say it is as easy to nurse in the dress as others but you can make it work.,67221,4
67221,The fabric stretches enough to allow this.,67221,4
67221,Note this is somewhat low cut so either wear a tank or flaunt it!,67221,4
67221,This dress can be worn for both a nursing dress and a regular dress!,67221,4
67222,It says red but in person it's dark pink.,67222,4
67223,On second day..My daughter don't like it anymore...,67223,4
67225,I love the product but it runs small.,67225,4
67228,This was a little big but worked perfectly.,67228,4
67228,The child I bought this for will eventually grown into it.,67228,4
67229,Looks great on my son and fits very well.,67229,4
67230,However the box I received is damaged and it's for a gift.,67230,4
67230,Besides that is worth it.,67230,4
67231,I really liked it.,67231,4
67231,"The button could have been a higher quality, But it really, really runs small.",67231,4
67231,I would say 2 dress sizes too small.,67231,4
67232,"After a week of wearing every day, taking it off at night and getting it wet minimally its still in great shape.",67232,4
67232,They only complaint I have is the edges aren't smoothed and the opening where the stone is hasn't been smoothed and it gets a little irritating to me.,67232,4
67232,Feels true to size.,67232,4
67234,These kept my hands nice and warm while skiing in the cold Colorado mountains.,67234,4
67234,"In fact, they were almost too warm!",67234,4
67234,My hands started sweating when I went skiing on a warmer day (temp was upper 20's F).,67234,4
67234,"Update 2/22/2018:
I lost one glove over the summer and since I loved these gloves (especially for the price) I bought them again.",67234,4
67234,I bought them a few years ago and had no issues.,67234,4
67234,This pair kept my hands fairly warm skiing in 15 F weather even with a strong wind with gusts of 40 mph.,67234,4
67234,"However, I went skiing again 3 days later and my gloves were still wet.",67234,4
67234,"Luckily, even with wet gloves my hands stayed warm.",67234,4
67234,"That night I put my gloves on the heater vent to dry, and 24 hours later they were still wet on the inside.",67234,4
67234,"I don't know what they changed with the gloves so they don't dry, but I did NOT have this issue with the first pair.",67234,4
67234,"I would give 3 stars because they don't dry (I have to throw them in the dryer to get them dry), but since they kept my hands warm when wet I increased to 4 stars.",67234,4
67234,"By the way, they have been in the clothes dryer for 35 minutes and they are still damp on the inside.",67234,4
67234,This is with a nice gas dryer that will dry my jeans in the same amount of time.,67234,4
67234,This is also after 24 hours on a heater vent and I gave up and so threw them in the dryer.,67234,4
67234,"Lastly, these gloves were not even that wet in the first place.",67234,4
67235,If you want trendy great look go for it,67235,4
67236,Nice dress but is a little shorter then I thought it would me.,67236,4
67236,Hits above the ankle.,67236,4
67236,My daughter is on the shorter side so figured the length would be long.,67236,4
67237,"Cute case, love it",67237,4
67239,"I have a smallish head and I was hoping thsee wouldnt be too big, but they're not, they're perfect.",67239,4
67239,Seem like they may be prone to stretching out but that's not too big of a deal if you take care of them.,67239,4
67239,"Good quality, they don't have a cheap feel and for the price I got them for that alone is four stars worth.",67239,4
67239,"They're quality shades buy em if you're questioning it, they're worth it.",67239,4
67239,"Edit: also if you buy these, make sure you wear them in a very sunny area.",67239,4
67239,If it's not bright enough it may hurt your eyes to have them idjus to the contrastING colors.,67239,4
67239,"It's weird, I know, but i had to get used to it.",67239,4
67239,It's not a bad thING necessarily but it took some adjusting to.,67239,4
67240,love the style wish they were darker tint,67240,4
67242,I finally got the right size.,67242,4
67242,The first time I order extra jumbo and it was way too big.,67242,4
67242,I got jumbo to fit my LV speedy 30.,67242,4
67242,I really like it.,67242,4
67242,The material is very good.,67242,4
67242,Make sure you read about the size before you order it.,67242,4
67242,Save time and money on returning.,67242,4
67243,Very comfy and super soft,67243,4
67244,Me and my boyfriend love this.,67244,4
67244,"However, the chains broke, but it may just be because I pulled too hard.",67244,4
67245,I wear a 34D and really wanted this to work for me.,67245,4
67245,Not sure if it's the shape of my breasts or the bralette itself but my tatas definitely don't fit well here.,67245,4
67245,"For such a cheap price though, the quality is great.",67245,4
67246,They get the job done.,67246,4
67246,I use these as shower shoes primarily.,67246,4
67248,"Great underwear, but the price is a bit more than I think it should be.",67248,4
67249,"Like them, just a bit large for women's hands..I feel I have average size.",67249,4
67249,I can fold the tips of fingers over and loose around wrist.,67249,4
67249,Overall I like the color and are warm.,67249,4
67250,"Very silky,  but descent material.",67250,4
67250,It does run very small....,67250,4
67251,Not the warmest long underwear but comfortable to wear all day and a good base layer for those of us that are in doors most of they day and outside some and don't what to get overheated.,67251,4
67251,I have been wearing a pair of these everyday since Dec 15th 2016.,67251,4
67251,I will probably wear throughout the winter.,67251,4
67251,I think for the price and quality you won't be disappointed.,67251,4
67252,I bought this dress to use for a project with fabric paint.,67252,4
67252,It appears to be well constructed but it is a bit thin (and being white a bit transparent) which is my only complaint.,67252,4
67252,It would be a great summer frock.,67252,4
67252,"I'm a shorter gal (5'2"") and it is slightly longer than I expected (mid to low thigh) so taller ladies could still wear this as a dress.",67252,4
67252,"I ordered a size M due to my bust size, but could have gotten away with the small as it does stretch.",67252,4
67252,"Instead, I'm going to wear it with a belt!",67252,4
67252,I would definitely consider buying in other colors-- the sleeves are darling.,67252,4
67253,I wear a medium.,67253,4
67253,"According to the reviews, it runs big...so I ordered a small.",67253,4
67253,"Well, it fit as expected, meaning I should have ordered a medium since that is what the size chart says.",67253,4
67253,The small was way too small.,67253,4
67253,"The costume is really cute though, so I'm just going to return it for a medium.",67253,4
67254,The only thing that would make them better is if they had pockets.,67254,4
67255,Beautiful but extraordinarily tiny sizes.,67255,4
67255,I thought extra large might fit according to their chart.,67255,4
67255,But I don't think even a 2x would be large enough.,67255,4
67255,The sizes are almost more suitable for children,67255,4
67257,These are pretty great.,67257,4
67257,"I hate wearing long sleeve shirts because I always push up the sleeves or pull them way down over my hands, but these have the nice little thumb holes, so I don't feel like I need to mess around with them or worry about stretching out my sleeves.",67257,4
67259,has a nice look,67259,4
67260,I like the briefs but they're too small.,67260,4
67260,I would say to get the minimum one size larger possibly two depending on your body type.,67260,4
67261,"The navel ring itself was longer that I needed it to be, but I haven't had any issues with it.",67261,4
67261,The heart charm did fall off though and I was bummed about that.,67261,4
67262,"Nice quality, seems durable.",67262,4
67263,It was a little weird to figure out how to put on.,67263,4
67263,I wanted something sexy for a night out on vacation with my hubby and it definitely got heads turning.,67263,4
67263,Wore it with a pair of skinny jeans and strappy heels.,67263,4
67263,It is supposed to fit loose around the boob area so it can drape.,67263,4
67263,"Be careful....if you bend over, you will give everyone a show.",67263,4
67263,I highly recommend skin tape to be worn with this.,67263,4
67263,"It fits small around the waste area, but I liked that, as it gave the shirt some form around my hips so it didn't look too slouchy.",67263,4
67264,The fabric is super cute and the shorts fit true to size but the top was to wide around my bust,67264,4
67266,"Fit very well and comfortable, wish legs were had  more elasticity.",67266,4
67267,Looks like a child painted the pretend buttons and accessories.,67267,4
67267,Mask great quality though.,67267,4
67268,They look nice but the hook doesn't work with it.,67268,4
67270,Not as broad as shown in the photo.,67270,4
67270,Disappointed as the size bought did not fit the particular finger for which I wanted it.,67270,4
67270,"Nevertheless, it fit another.",67270,4
67271,"shorter than I expected, but a good shirt.",67271,4
67272,Definitely helping my foot pain.,67272,4
67272,The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it's too early to tell how durable they will be.,67272,4
67273,You may want to consider getting one that cover the back portion of the neck better.,67273,4
67273,"Despite this, this does a great job of keeping my head comfortable in 20 degree weather at night.",67273,4
67273,I cover up to below my bottom lip.,67273,4
67273,"I can still pull it down to show my entire face, but that's uncomfortable after a prolonged period of time.",67273,4
67275,a Little small for what i used to but just lovely !,67275,4
67277,I love the set!,67277,4
67277,It's beautiful in color and has high quality fabric.,67277,4
67277,"I can wear anywhere from a small to a medium in bottoms (5'2, 128 lbs) but since I read the bottoms can run small for people with wide hips, I moved for a larger size and do not regret it!",67277,4
67277,The set is better matching than most Victoria's sets I've bought and I think I will be sticking to this brand for flirty wear from now on!,67277,4
67277,My only complaint is that the bra is a little pokey and scratchy under the arms.,67277,4
67277,"It's not a bra I'd wear everyday to work, but I doubt it was intended to be.",67277,4
67277,Definitely great for a date or a fun night out!,67277,4
67278,The logo should be Silent Service SubmarineS (plural not singular),67278,4
67279,Good product great price,67279,4
67280,The material was a little different that I expected.,67280,4
67280,But it still looks really good on me,67280,4
67281,I wear tank tops all the time here in Hawaii and great buy.,67281,4
67282,Way smaller than the photo shows.,67282,4
67282,Or the phot has an x-small model with a large shirt.,67282,4
67283,They are a little snug but very comfortable..,67283,4
67283,I wear then at the gym and they hold my girls in place..I'm a 34DD had I gone up a size I'm sure they wouldn't be as comfortable..,67283,4
67283,I really like these bra's and the price is even better!,67283,4
67284,"Runs a like big, but very nice received  many compliments.",67284,4
67285,I got these for my girlfriend and she loves them.,67285,4
67285,She is a size xs/s and said she can't imagine them fitting anyone who wears a size much larger.,67285,4
67285,"Her only disappointment was that they are definitely tights, not leggings.",67285,4
67286,These were somewhat large and I used the sizing chart.,67286,4
67286,My daughter loved them but will just have wait to wear them as I felt it was too much hassle to return.,67286,4
67287,These pants are great.,67287,4
67287,Really comftorable and can be worn when going out or when lounging around in the house.,67287,4
67288,The color is a bit more tan than the image.,67288,4
67288,"It is also a bit thin, so I can see the lines of my bra easily.",67288,4
67288,I do like the dress.,67288,4
67288,I wish they had more color options.,67288,4
67289,Works great and looks great.,67289,4
67289,I wish the little arms all folded out together instead of individually sometimes.,67289,4
67289,I am using it to store tank tops on.,67289,4
67290,cute but very faded.,67290,4
67290,"I think my teen will think it's funny, tho.",67290,4
67291,For 9 dollars this is an ok buy.,67291,4
67291,The glasses feel flimsy but thats alright.,67291,4
67291,The glasses came in a box and a bag.,67291,4
67291,The glasses had some dirt but no scratches.,67291,4
67291,Overall looking foward to wearing them out in the sun.,67291,4
67292,"This was helpful in the beginning of my pregnancy so I didn't have to purchase a ton of maternity clothes, this allows you to wear your own pants longer.",67292,4
67293,"Cute, soft and snugly but definitely order two sizes up my son is 7 months i ordered size 12 months and it fits perfect wish I would have gotten 18 months so they can last longer",67293,4
67294,"Excellent quality, looks and feels great, very soft, but way too heavy.",67294,4
67294,"I walk a lot and have additional backpack, so need something more practical.",67294,4
67295,They were exactly what I had expected.,67295,4
67296,"This is a really super cute coat, but was too small for me :( I gave it to my aunt and she loves it.",67296,4
67296,Says it is nice and warm.,67296,4
67298,"Great fit, as expected, looks amazing on our Daughter.",67298,4
67298,"No one else at the pool has this pattern, win!",67298,4

67301,Nice and affordable knock off adidas <3,67301,4
67302,Just didn't like the jeans.,67302,4
67302,Just too many fees when returning item.,67302,4
67303,I really like the fit and the price was great !,67303,4
67304,"I don't know if it's my son or the shirt, but I would order a size up!",67304,4
67305,It is a nice shirt.,67305,4
67305,"Yeah there are some loose threads, but for what I paid, I am ok clipping away a few threads!",67305,4
67305,I may purchase a few more in different colors!,67305,4
67306,Love the print and style.,67306,4
67306,Fits my kindle in the middle pouch.,67306,4

67310,They arrived fast and early.,67310,4
67311,The design is subtly sexy.,67311,4
67311,Does justice to one's figure.,67311,4
67311,I worked with the size chart and it fit well.,67311,4
67311,I'm a bit flat chested so the breast part was a tad too big.,67311,4
67311,It sucks that there's only one hook for bra at the back though,67311,4
67312,Snug fit but good for dancing,67312,4
67313,"Great material, very comfortable.",67313,4
67313,Just a little bit bigger than I read in the sizing.,67313,4
67313,I should have ordered 1 size down.,67313,4
67313,But again very nice shirt.,67313,4
67314,Not stylish by any means....but works perfect for when you go to stadiums.,67314,4
67314,Think plastic so no worries of tearing it.,67314,4
67314,Better shape than most the others like this so you can fit more in it.,67314,4
67316,They tend to come at the neck seam but they are anti-flammable.,67316,4
67317,I am impressed with the overall quality of this bag.,67317,4
67317,"It measures about 12"" L x 18"" H x 6"" wide.",67317,4
67317,"It will fit a 15"" laptop plus many other items.",67317,4
67317,"The bag features a large main compartment which has a padded area for your laptop, room for books and binders, and a small zippered compartment to store pens/pencils.",67317,4
67317,"The second largest compartment is big enough to hold a tablet, small books, and notebooks.",67317,4
67317,The front zippered pocket is pretty deep and could store many items.,67317,4
67317,Their are also two mesh pockets on the sides of the backpack to store water bottles.,67317,4
67317,All of the zippers feature leather pulls and the zippers seem to be good quality.,67317,4
67317,The fabric is cotton canvas and is relatively water resistant.,67317,4
67317,I tested the backpack walking up and down my long driveway while it was lightly raining and all of the contents of the backpack stayed dry.,67317,4
67317,I chose the black color and it could easily work for both men and women.,67317,4
67317,"Pros:
- Cotton canvas is easy to clean and looks nice.",67317,4
67317,- Backpack is large enough to hold many items.,67317,4
67317,- Features a laptop pocket.,67317,4
67317,- All compartments are spacious.,67317,4
67317,- 1 year warranty.,67317,4

67317,"Overall, this is a nice backpack for a commuter or college student.",67317,4
67317,I was given the chance to buy this at a discounted rate in order to test the product.,67317,4
67317,My goal is to help others make informed purchasing decisions.,67317,4
67317,"Thus, my review is in no part impacted by the discount.",67317,4
67317,"If you have any questions, please leave a comment and I will be happy to help answer them if I can.",67317,4
67317,I hope you found my review to be helpful.,67317,4
67318,A little tight in the waist but what do expect for one size fits all.,67318,4
67319,Purchased for a friend and she loves it,67319,4
67322,"Annoying tag on the inside, had to be cut out.",67322,4
67323,Not sure what the picture is - a disposable camera?,67323,4
67323,"- but I'm reviewing the MEIZU BT headphones, which overall are nice.",67323,4
67323,I can't get a real snug fit which means I'm losing some bass.,67323,4
67323,Occasionally the buds won't connect; removing and adding them back does the trick.,67323,4
67324,Great addition to my wedding dress.,67324,4
67325,short were fine but top was too small,67325,4
67326,I really love the color and weight of this tunic top.,67326,4
67326,My only problem came after I washed it and the material began to gap between the sets of buttons.,67326,4
67326,The problem was easily solved by sewing the gap shut.,67326,4
67326,"I'm never going to unbutton the top to take it off, but will remove it over my head.",67326,4
67326,"The label at the back of the neck was rather stiff, so I removed it.",67326,4
67327,"It arrived on time, fits small, a little hard to position, but very sticky and does its job anyway",67327,4
67328,"Nice color, plenty of bling",67328,4
67331,It holds everything I need.,67331,4
67331,Perfect front pocket wallet.,67331,4
67331,You forget you have a wallet in your pocket it's so light.,67331,4
67331,If you're used to a firmer wallet like a leather one then this will take a min to get used to.,67331,4
67331,It's literally just rip stop nylon and nothing but your credit cards to firm it up.,67331,4
67332,Broke very easily but as incredibly easy to fix as well!,67332,4
67333,Super comfortable and super cute!,67333,4
67333,Doublju also makes this same dress in a midi-length with long sleeves and it is just as beautiful and flattering.,67333,4
67333,I wear a small and this fit was true to size.,67333,4
67334,They are comfortable but tend to ride up and bunch up on the legs.,67334,4
67334,Also the gusset parts don't seem to be as large as the quest 2.0.,67334,4
67336,Love it for crawlers.,67336,4
67336,I used it with my baby for 3 months to protect his knees,67336,4
67337,"Much more well constructed than I expected from this price - Although, my daughter did not like the beadwork, and thought it looked cheap.",67337,4
67337,The fit was perfect in a size 2.,67337,4
67337,"The dress, as most formal dresses, is very long, plus has the train, so it ended up being much too long even with 5"" heels on my 5'6"" daughter.",67337,4
67339,I ordered one size bigger after reading the reviews that seem to work out about right,67339,4
67340,Its great material it just fits a little tight and I like flowy !,67340,4
67340,The bow needed to be tacked down on the corners but overall it is very very cute :),67340,4
67341,very cute top but I had to purchase a size up.,67341,4
67341,I normally wear a medium between a size 8 and 10 and I ordered a large.,67341,4
67341,It is very form fitting but material stretches so fits me just fine.,67341,4
67341,The only thing is that there is an under layer that if you don't make sure to smooth it out can make the shirt look a little ruffled.,67341,4
67342,I like the product but I definitely needed to order a size larger.,67342,4
67342,The medium fit like a small.,67342,4
67343,Always remeber that when ordering your size in the us we are LARGER ...the fits is good but could use a little more room !,67343,4
67343,I really like them and will order again from the making sure to size up 2 times more then my size.....Thank you !,67343,4
67344,Keep in mind these have a built-in basket for your cash and prizes.,67344,4
67344,One could argue it feels like a scrotal training bra.,67344,4
67344,Recommended for the newly vasectomied.,67344,4
67345,"Only down side is the clamp feels a little off, almost as if it's stiff.",67345,4
67345,I got it open with care but I'll still have to be cautious.,67345,4
67345,Over all it looks great!,67345,4
67346,"A bit in the snug side, but beautifully made.",67346,4
67346,"I usually wear a size Small, but I'm glad I ordered a Medium!",67346,4
67346,The material is comfy and the lace arm pieces are lovely.,67346,4
67347,Just what the ad said it was,67347,4
67348,"Have only used for a few days, but so far it is great!",67348,4
67348,Material seems sturdy and zippers do not seem cheap.,67348,4
67349,Excellent product for recent shoulder surgery patient.,67349,4
67349,Material is comfortable and breathable.,67349,4
67349,"Zippers are very tiny, so person would need assistance putting on the shirt.",67349,4
67349,"Although it is stated in the directions, you must remember that the zipper opening is from the top down.",67349,4
67349,You cannot separate the shirt to open the arm sleeve unless you match the red marks at the top of the shirt on the shoulder side.,67349,4
67349,Four stars because it is so expensive.,67349,4
67350,"It's very warm and fashionable, but the sleeves are shorter than I'd like.",67350,4
67350,"Otherwise, very comfy and warm.",67350,4
67351,This is really cute.,67351,4
67351,My only complaint is it comes undone easily once it gets just a little loose.,67351,4
67351,I have a few colors.,67351,4
67351,Just make sure to check and keep tight and they are great!,67351,4
67352,Material and color are nice.,67352,4
67352,It has two small pockets (one below each hip) that can accomodate keys or a phone.,67352,4
67352,It is a good value for the price.,67352,4
67352,"I'm a size 6-8 and ordered a M that is not sufficiently tight, but good enough that is not worth returning/exchanging.",67352,4
67352,I wore it this morning and it was fine.,67352,4
67353,I love the design and the work took to make it.,67353,4
67353,But unfortunately the skirt was too small even my girlfriend who is smaller than me couldn't fit it.,67353,4
67354,The quality is good for the price.,67354,4
67354,Very nice but sad that they don't fit.,67354,4
67354,"I'm usually a Large & bought XL, but still doesn't fit.",67354,4
67354,That's why giving it 1 star less.,67354,4
67355,Order a size larger then what they are.,67355,4
67356,Very happy with this.,67356,4
67356,Not only looks great but works great too.,67356,4
67356,Would have liked the handle to be just a little longer so it could be worn cross body.,67356,4
67357,fitted shirt on the large size.,67357,4
67357,otherwise everything else is fine,67357,4
67358,I wish the height was a little larger.,67358,4
67358,Standard site brush and combs barely fit.,67358,4
67358,Could also use a larger hanger hook Hook is very small and does not fit over most towel bars but I was able to insert a larger hook myself.,67358,4
67358,"Regardless of these issues, it is a good quality product and I love the internal pockets that keep my toiletries organized!",67358,4
67359,I'm a US size 10 and the XL fits perfect.,67359,4
67360,love it and get compliments but too big so makes me look frumpy,67360,4
67361,"Champion makes great socks, good weight (thickness) to them, which my husband likes.",67361,4
67362,"My little guy just had a height growth spurt, so I needed the extra length.",67362,4
67362,"I have found with most Gerber clothes I own, however, they do tend to be a little wide.",67362,4
67362,These PJs are VERY warm though!,67362,4
67363,Great top for the money.,67363,4
67363,It came right on time and looks just like the picture.,67363,4
67365,Its very gray and short,67365,4
67366,"I get what some other reviews mentioned about the neck line, but I think you need to understand that it's baggy and shruggy on purpose (at least, in my opinion).",67366,4
67366,"I wanted to wear this as a sweater dress but it's just a tiny bit too short on me (I'm 5'3"").",67366,4
67366,"If you're 5"" or shorter, you could probably wear this as a dress, otherwise it's a cool sweater.",67366,4
67368,"It runs a little small, but stretches.",67368,4
67368,It will make a good slip for a backless dress,67368,4
67369,I use these as insoles for my boots.,67369,4
67369,"I can wear them all day, but sometimes i want to stand at my desk, in which case, i can probably do an hour before i get slightly sore.",67369,4
67369,"A good combination might be these for arch support, and then a gel insole for comfort",67369,4
67370,"Is good for a younger look, for layering over another piece.",67370,4
67370,Have received many compliments.,67370,4
67370,"Is rather cheaply made however, but considering the price...",67370,4
67371,Great purchase the quality of the bag is great ... the price fantastic for the quality....,67371,4
67371,"The only down fall for me is that it only has one compartment no dividers or separator in the compartment, other than that it is great.",67371,4
67371,Colour is gorgeous and matches a pair of boots I purchased via amazon.,67371,4
67372,"Great quality pack, only reason for 4 stars is because it's starting to rip where the straps are attached, but it survived Bonnaroo 2016 with me doing all kinds of craziness... so for the price I'd say it worth it.",67372,4
67373,I'm giving these a 4 star for their cuteness.,67373,4
67373,"I chose them because they had two velcro straps which I thought were important because on so many of these types of kid's shoes, the velcro wears out, peels off or gets enough lint caught in it that it doesn't stick very well after awhile.",67373,4
67373,"So with two, I figured it would stay put better than the ones with the elastic pieces in lieu of another strap.",67373,4
67373,"I also chose these because they had a light in the toe as well as on the heal part, where some styles only had one light in the heel.",67373,4
67374,This is a very nice casual Tee.,67374,4
67374,The quality of this item was more than I expected.,67374,4
67374,"For a good bargin price, no one cant complain :)",67374,4
67375,Great suit for the price.,67375,4
67375,"It is teeny tiny, but perfect for an exotic beach vacation.",67375,4
67376,somewhat smaller than I hope,67376,4
67377,I have almost a pear shape so I wish it was a little tighter....,67377,4
67378,"Its a good value for the price, it does not look expensive and the bottom is larger than the top, and my tummy shows a little on the sides where the shirt comes up, but over all its a nice shirt for hanging out...",67378,4
67379,"It fit as expected, but needed some alterations because the leg straps were very loose...",67379,4
67379,"I ordered a size XS and am 5'2"", 90lbs.",67379,4
67380,"It's very nice, just a bit too small.",67380,4
67381,Really cute dress but I'm returning mine because the top is too large.,67381,4
67383,Liked it but I'm short so sleeves are too long but can put up as shown,67383,4
67384,"Wore them for four days, it's hard to make a review and only wearing a couple days.",67384,4
67384,I believe it is helping my feet.,67384,4
67385,I love this swim suit a lot but it is a little small to where I can't comfortably move as I please sometimes with out it moving and me having to adjust it.,67385,4
67385,I wear a small for everything but if you have a bigger bust but still small I would recommend a medium,67385,4
67386,comes in handy during this typhoon season,67386,4
67387,"Smaller than expected, and not very much support... Super Cute though!",67387,4
67388,Absolutely adore this item.,67388,4
67388,"I will say it's a tag itchy, but not so much so that it's constantly uncomfortable.",67388,4
67388,I usually wear a medium or large and I'm a size 12 so I got the large for this.,67388,4
67389,For the price the fit was great and I can wear for several hours pain free...,67389,4
67390,"My nephew loves it but I brought it big so he can grow into it, the slippers fit a little bit loose but that's how I wanted it since he is still a growing boy",67390,4
67391,"I've had lots of Aloha shirts, first online purchase.",67391,4
67392,"Material is nice, a bit on the heavier side but well made.",67392,4
67392,I ordered a medium based on other reviews...and returned.,67392,4
67392,"5'7"", 27/28 waist, 36C and was just on the too snug side for comfort level.",67392,4
67392,It has a ltitle stretch but feel a ltitle more room would make it more flattering... will be ordering a large to see how that fit works!,67392,4
67393,This is so feminine but unfortunately too small.,67393,4
67393,It's hard to see in the pics but it has a scallop neckline.,67393,4
67393,"I am 5'7"", 155, and normally wear size 12.",67393,4
67393,I ordered a Large and could even zip it.,67393,4
67393,I need to size up 2times.,67393,4
67394,The stone is a little too big.,67394,4
67396,Love the set up of this wallet and the color is beautiful.,67396,4
67396,It does smell a little strange but it wears off.,67396,4
67398,I bought this as a cheap gag gift for my man but I actually like it so much that I wear it every now and then.,67398,4
67398,I would buy this again for another person who wears cuffs.,67398,4
67399,"They are much more translucent than I expected but that is not an issue to me at all, I was happy about that.",67399,4
67399,They are a beautiful blue in the light and true to size.,67399,4
67399,They got to me much sooner than the estimated shipping date which I know has nothing to do with the seller but it was certainly a pro.,67399,4
67399,The only issue I have is that one plug has 2 small bubbles in it and a faint line in the other which resulted in the 4 star review.,67399,4
67400,"Works for dentists' appointments, but it isn't exactly clear.",67400,4
67400,"It's more like white plastic; you can still see it very clearly, so don't buy this if you are trying to camouflage a piercing for work purposes.",67400,4
67400,Review based on use in a lip piercing.,67400,4
67402,"Love the pin, the only downside is the clasp on the back.",67402,4
67402,Seems like it can easily come undone and the pin would fall right off :(.,67402,4
67402,Gonna have to super glue this baby to the back!,67402,4
67403,"If this shirt fit better, I'd have given it 5 stars.",67403,4
67403,"I'm a typical medium, more often an 8 than a 10, but this one is a little snug.",67403,4
67404,Good quality and good design.,67404,4
67404,I bought this shirt for my boyfriend and he love it.,67404,4
67405,"Product was fine, lil snug, asked if there was a larger size, wasn't available",67405,4
67406,I got these pretty little things for my grandaughter beforeshe started walking.,67406,4
67406,They worked perfect for her.,67406,4
67406,I would not suggest for a child that is walking the sole is thin and very lil arch support if any.,67406,4
67407,I bought this for a my little pony/sailor moon crossover cosplay.,67407,4
67407,"I'm going to be Pinkiepie :)

Size ordered: Medium because a lot of the reviews said it ran small.",67407,4
67407,the thing with this skirt is that you need to unzip it all the way and pull it up to your waist then zip it up and pull it down.,67407,4
67407,The shirt does stretch but if you are bigger in the bust it might be an issue.,67407,4
67407,"As for the skirt if you are bigger than me in the hips/waist or taller than me then buy large because its a bit tight but not too bad, it zips up all the way.",67407,4
67407,Its also really short so wear something under it if that's a problem.,67407,4
67407,"Ordered: January 4th
Estimated delivery: February 16th
Arrived: January 21st

My measurements (rough estimate of my measurements but i did do the math so you don't have to sit here trying to figure out measurements in CM)
Bust: 32 inches = 81.28 centimetres
Waist: 28 inches = 71.12 centimetres
Hips: 32 inches = 81.28 centimetres
Height: 5,1 (61 inches inches = 154.94 centimetres)",67407,4
67408,I'd recommend ordering a size up one or two but very cute and very see through.,67408,4
67408,I'd recommend something under this as it is very see through.,67408,4
67409,"was looking for a crew neck,come round neck,looks good,fits good",67409,4
67410,My favorite purchase on here!!!,67410,4
67410,Mine was way too small so I requested a return and received a partial return of funds instead.,67410,4
67410,I then took the dress to the tailors and had it altered to fit.,67410,4
67410,Now I have a skirt that I adore.,67410,4
67410,I would encourage you to order two sizes up.,67410,4
67410,My tailor had to add 4 inches to the waist,67410,4
67411,"its nice, its not red tho more like coral and when I go to a different light setting it looks hot pink lol",67411,4
67412,This dress is such a good staple to have in your wardrobe.,67412,4
67412,"So cute and comfy, you can dress it up or down as you see fit.",67412,4
67412,It fit a little big but still really cute.,67412,4
67413,The band is thin but it's expected from a ring that cost 2.99,67413,4
67414,"They look awesome, they fit great, and they are so comfy",67414,4
67415,Nice quality just had to order two sizes bigger then normal for it to fit,67415,4
67416,It is nice but I don't like the setting!,67416,4
67417,The hat is gorgeous.,67417,4
67417,However it seems a little small.,67417,4
67418,This is a very cute top the only probably with it is that you can see your nipples through the shirt so you might want to wear something to cover them but other than that it's very cute,67418,4
67419,"Bottoms fit perfectly, but the top was a bit too small.",67419,4
67419,Would've given 4 and a half but it won't let me.,67419,4
67419,It came in good timing and everything though!,67419,4
67419,Is there anyway that I could get the top by itself in a larger size?,67419,4
67419,I only tried on the top once.,67419,4
67420,Came packaged in a cellophane bag...had a little trouble wrapping it for Christmas.,67420,4

67421,"Great bag, perfect size to travel, gym , excursion or go to the beach, nice color and material.",67421,4
67422,Fits good just a little loose in the back where the straps are,67422,4
67423,Tight across the bust,67423,4
67424,The price is on point.,67424,4
67424,"They look nice, but I didn't like the small rubbery backs.",67424,4
67424,Other than that they were a great gift for my niece in middle school,67424,4
67425,"nice fabric, great fit",67425,4
67426,It looks expensive and is well made.,67426,4

67427,She loved it and said it was perfect!,67427,4
67428,"The color is as expected, a nice dusty olive green.",67428,4
67428,The material is very decent; I like it.,67428,4
67428,"The size however, I knew would be an issue so I purposely ordered a large.",67428,4
67428,I'm petite 5'3 120 lbs --with a 'not too big not too small' chest and bottom.,67428,4
67428,The large fit perfectly.,67428,4
67428,"If you are smaller than me, this romper will work for you perhaps even in a smaller size, but if you are any bigger than me I would buy with caution...definitely don't get less than a size large!",67428,4
67429,I thought they would be wider but 8.5 is small.,67429,4
67430,item fits somewhat small.,67430,4
67430,"Ordered large, fits  like medium.",67430,4
67431,Nice but I thought it would be bigger.,67431,4
67432,given as a gift,67432,4
67433,This is the second pair of RBX yoga pants I have purchase.,67433,4

67434,"Not very ""tall"" compared to others ordered.",67434,4
67435,"nice party gift for the price, the kids loved them!",67435,4
67436,My 5 year old nephew really likes his lab coat - it was a success!,67436,4
67437,"Color as described and good quality, except that the bow is not attached properly and it threads  are about to cut.",67437,4
67437,"Anyway is cute and soft,  aND had pretty details as the pearls buttons.",67437,4
67438,"I'm 5'6"", 185 lbs.",67438,4
67438,"I'm thick, so I worry about buying ""one size fits all"" sorts of things.",67438,4
67438,But this fits great with plenty of extra room!,67438,4
67438,Can't wait to show it off on my cruise.,67438,4
67438,"I got the white cover up with blue tassels, looks cute but I wish the tassels were as vibrant in person as they were in the picture (they're more of a saturated blue).",67438,4
67438,That's the only reason this gets a 4 out of 5 stars.,67438,4
67438,"Even still, can't complain especially for the price!",67438,4
67440,"Dress is nice, the material is heavy but overall no complaints.",67440,4
67440,I will have the dress altered because it is so large around the waist.,67440,4
67441,It's a nice scarf for the price.,67441,4
67441,"Overall, this product was better than expected.",67441,4
67442,This sweatshirt is awesome!,67442,4
67442,I really love the odd future design my one pet peave is that it is a little small on me I'm a large and ordered an extra large all it needs is just a little bit of stretching and should b good to go,67442,4
67443,The sweater is light weight but will be able to be used in summer and winter months.,67443,4
67443,Is exactly what I expected from this brand (this is Target's Merona brand)  the seller got the sweater off to me very quickly.,67443,4
67443,Would purchase from seller again.,67443,4
67445,My wife ordered this for her mom.,67445,4

67445,She says it fits great!,67445,4
67446,very nice - works great,67446,4
67447,I bought these for a gift.,67447,4
67447,I was expecting to see some green in the stone but the stone looks very clear.,67447,4
67447,I took a picture to show someone the earrings an in the photo I can see a tint of green.,67447,4
67447,They're pretty even though I don't see any tint of green.,67447,4
67447,I'm hoping the person I bought these for will like them as much as I do.,67447,4
67448,Fit was good as it is adjustable.,67448,4
67448,As an African American with very dry hair it does help because I wear it to bed.,67448,4
67448,It is heavy and I would like to have one that is less heavy and shorter as there is to much hanging off my head.,67448,4
67449,The foot fitter tends to slide upward out of the shoe and the taps used to shape the shoe fall out when pulling out the foot fitter,67449,4
67450,"I like the product, but I thought the string would be a little stronger.",67450,4
67451,"Very cute, fits fine, very very thing though.",67451,4
67452,Ordered this for my game room and YouTube videos.,67452,4
67452,Appreciated the decent material and craftsmanship for the price.,67452,4
67452,"The Sega logo is a bit narrower than it should be and isn't as nearly bright as the picture would have you believe, but otherwise it is a solid product that is made well.",67452,4
67452,Not bad at all for the money.,67452,4
67453,I bought these because the price was right.,67453,4
67453,They look very nice and seem to be good quality except one of them came damaged.,67453,4
67453,I decided not to return since the other 5 worked great.,67453,4
67453,The colors are nice and vibrant.,67453,4
67454,"My husband wears a pant size 32, and the costume fit him just right.",67454,4
67454,The material is as expected for a halloween costume.,67454,4
67454,It will work fine for one party.,67454,4
67455,"Nice product, am satisfied with it",67455,4
67456,I wear flip flops more than any other shoes and I break a lot of flip flops.,67456,4
67456,"As far as simple, plastic flip flops go, these seem to last the longest and feel the best to me.",67456,4
67456,They hold their shape very well and have never taken on the imprint of my foot after lots of use.,67456,4
67456,I have broken two pairs of these and it's always the round stopper that holds the top strap to the footing that breaks off.,67456,4
67456,I still choose these every time over other plastic flip flop brands.,67456,4
67457,The dress fits well.,67457,4
67457,It is a hand wash only item.,67457,4
67457,"Not the highest of quality, but it was what I expected for what was paid.",67457,4
67457,I did receive many compliments when I wore it the first time.,67457,4
67459,Only complaint is they are kind of stiff but a really cute boot!!,67459,4
67460,These are so delicate and pretty and the colors were great.,67460,4
67460,My only complaint is the cotton portion of the panty is too small.,67460,4
67461,Pretty solid would give it five stars if it you could effectively hold all the cards and cash per the description.,67461,4
67461,It does not feel bulky in my pocket but you will occasionally tear up a dollar bill or two if you carry more than 7-8 cards and have a small group of bills.,67461,4
67461,"It is a larger clip but it ""will not"" seamlessly hold all that is advertised on the description.",67461,4
67463,Very pretty and arrived very quickly (thank you Amazon Prime).,67463,4
67463,The eyeglass case is well made but it certainly does not hold two pairs of glasses.,67463,4
67463,It will hold one plus maybe some credit cards or a cell phone; something flat.,67463,4
67463,I bought it as a gift for a coworker who likes the pattern.,67463,4
67464,It did not take long for the cover color to start going off.,67464,4
67464,Otherwise it seems to be working fine.,67464,4
67464,The opening and closing mechanic it self seems strong.,67464,4
67465,I said somewhat small because I ordered a xl and received a large.,67465,4
67465,"However though it did fit, luckily.",67465,4
67465,"I do like and think it is very nice, I get many compliments.",67465,4
67466,"I love this pendant, but I wish it was a little bigger so the word would be more easily readable.",67466,4
67466,"It measures one inch across, and features a clear rounded plastic cover on the front rather than a flat one..  Comes with a delicate 24-inch dark-gray ball chain rather than the black link chain shown in the picture.",67466,4
67466,My advice would be to put the pendant on another chain--the ball chain looks like it's VERY easily breakable!,67466,4
67466,"Despite the pendant's small size, it's a cute accessory that I'll be proud to wear!",67466,4
67467,"The product seems well made and is holding up so far taming the belly :-)

thanks, Cliff",67467,4
67468,work and looks just grest,67468,4
67470,Love these shoes great fit and makes it safe for my little one as she walks around in and out of the pool.,67470,4
67471,nice - but label is in an odd location,67471,4
67472,"The material was really great , however the size on the comparison  on the chart is a size up..I bought one before and it was extremely big  n this one was slightly big..by the product is good",67472,4
67473,"They look great, even better using a garter",67473,4
67474,Very cute top i get a lot of compliments.,67474,4
67474,"it fit well I just wish it was a little bigger, so the sleeves could be longer but I have no problems pushing them up.",67474,4
67475,I am a male and I found the 6mm to be a little wide for me - and I am not a small dude with small fingers.,67475,4
67475,"6 foot 1, 250 lbs, and I would prefer to go with a 4mm instead - which happens to be the same size my wife wears!",67475,4
67475,Quality is good though.,67475,4
67476,Absolutely LOVE this out fit.,67476,4
67476,I only gave 4 stars because even after reading the reviews and ordering down a size it was still a little bigger then I would like but it is still wearable.,67476,4
67476,I ordered Red and Blue.,67476,4
67476,I just put in an order for black and white this time in a small.,67476,4
67476,"These will be my go to outfits for a quick, cute, date night, club night etc.",67476,4
67476,LOVE IT AND THE PRICE!!,67476,4
67477,"Beautiful dress, quality is good.",67477,4
67477,"I normally wear a Small (B cup), but went with Medium after reading reviews.",67477,4
67477,"It fit very snug, so ended up with Large to get it to fit correctly.",67477,4
67477,"Very low cut, I stiched the bra area to cut down on cleavage.",67477,4
67478,this is much prettier is person i cannot wait to wear it on my cruise the only down side is that its super long so im going to have to wear a higher sandal but other then that its beautiful tons of room id say go a size down,67478,4
67479,They are kinda wide in the bridge of the nose but omg so different I love wearing them,67479,4
67480,Charm is nice but the picture looked like it was 3 colors.,67480,4
67480,One I received is not.,67480,4
67480,Still nice anyway but not what I expected!,67480,4
67481,Colors are pretty and received many compliments.,67481,4
67481,The lace edge has already frayed.,67481,4
67481,It has been worn and washed once.,67481,4
67482,Like the beautiful picture dress.,67482,4
67484,"Super cute, they feel really durable, bigger than excepted.",67484,4
67484,"Took almost a month to arrive, which isn't ideal..  and 1 of the stones was missing when I received them, not super noticeable, but it still a little annoying.",67484,4
67485,It qaa way to long in the arms and it was to long on him,67485,4
67486,Very comfortable and soft but the size runs a little small which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5.,67486,4
67487,The strap was a bit too long but I expected that from reading the other reviews.,67487,4
67487,It was easily altered and was perfect for a tea party photo shoot.,67487,4
67487,Actually pretty good quality for the price.,67487,4
67488,The hat was a perfect fit...goes so well with my camp purse and my olive green pink shirt from vicky..,67488,4
67490,This is a convenient little bag to fit perfectly under the seat.,67490,4
67490,I was able to get sufficient amount of clothing in the bag for my short trip and not have to pay any luggage fees.,67490,4
67491,Cute for Forth of July and for our cowboy birthday party for big brother!,67491,4
67492,I love the saying and the play...,67492,4
67495,Did not arrive on time but sid dit and look great,67495,4
67497,It's lined and the material is OK.,67497,4
67497,I bought it to sleep in but you can wear it out if you wanted to.,67497,4
67498,Haven't used it yet but seems very sturdy.,67498,4
67498,Thinking about getting my sister one for a Christmas present.,67498,4
67499,Looks great feels great,67499,4
67500,"This product fit as expected but it seemed like the dress, depending on the color are made by different people, several girls and I brought these dresses but all in different color.",67500,4
67500,Depending on the color the embellishment along the waist and how it is made is different.,67500,4
67500,"Some of us would have zipper side, some would have just elastic waist, some had actually rhinestone on the embellishment and some had glue on or sew on sequins.",67500,4
67500,"One girl got the wrong color shipped too her and had to return it and get another shipped to her, in the end it did the job for our event but we do not plan on ever wearing this dress again.",67500,4
67503,The bodice is totally weird.,67503,4
67503,I usually wear an off the rack size 10.,67503,4
67503,"This one fits my waist (30"") but the bust is enormous, has odd cone-shaped padding inside, and the boning protrudes unnaturally.",67503,4
67503,I will have to do some alterations myself.,67503,4
67503,Definitely worth the $45 I paid.,67503,4
67503,"I will fix the weirdness, and I will have a great dress.",67503,4
67503,UPDATE: I must add that this company did kindly notify me and offer a partial refund.,67503,4
67503,They apologized for my inconvenience.,67503,4
67503,"Had this dress been over $100, I would have accepted.",67503,4
67503,"I think the price for this dress is very reasonable, and did not want to accept the refund.",67503,4
67503,"This company showed care and respect for me as a customer, and that should definitely be recognized.",67503,4
67503,I added another star to my review for this.,67503,4
67503,Thank you Grace Karin.,67503,4
67504,This is exactly what I needed.,67504,4
67504,"The T-shirt is soft, washes well in cold water and line dried.",67504,4
67504,I use is as sleepwear or a casual shirt with jeans.,67504,4

67504,These t-shirts are perfect for easy summer wear.,67504,4
67505,Very pretty color ; I'm 5'7'' weigh 149 medium fit perfectly,67505,4
67506,"I love the designs on these bracelets; the only thing I would change is the size of the black part on the ""her king"" bracelet.",67506,4
67506,It's small compared to the size of my boyfriend's wrist - and his wrist isn't all that big - so I think it would look better if it were a little bit larger.,67506,4
67506,Other than that I think these bracelets are great.,67506,4
67507,It did what I was looking for:  a little lift in the right place without looking fake!,67507,4
67508,good fit good price,67508,4
67509,"Very nice suit, just doesn't cover my bust... (36G).",67509,4
67509,Finding one that fits is an ongoing quest.,67509,4
67509,I wish I had fit it!!,67509,4
67509,It is super cute!,67509,4
67510,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because It was not clear that you only get one and it takes a month to receive the product.,67510,4
67511,The aspiring goth in me had to have this septum ring.,67511,4
67511,It looks great and goes very well with lacy black clothes.,67511,4
67511,"However, if your septum piercing is higher up (like mine), and/or if your webbing is a little thick, the clicker is difficult to maneuver on this ring.",67511,4
67511,"It is worth the effort, though!",67511,4
67512,"This is the 3rd watch I've purchased from this company  (megir) the first two got 5stars, the quality that you get with these warches is amazing for the price.",67512,4
67512,This one however has a very light feel to the band.,67512,4
67512,That's my only complaint.,67512,4
67513,Nice fit and fabric is good quality.,67513,4
67513,"It is a little long on me (I'm 5'3"") but other than that it is a nice dress.",67513,4
67514,My son is 5 months old but is very tall and is in 9  month and 12 month sleepers.,67514,4
67514,I ordered the 12 month because gerber has always ran small for all my kids.,67514,4
67514,I was sent an 18 month size instead so is big on him now but he will grow in to them in the next couple months .,67514,4
67514,"no worries, they are very soft and comfy , cant wait till he can wear them.",67514,4
67515,"I ordered a L, wasn't too sure how the sizing would be but I could have probably gotten away with a M. The material isn't the greatest but it's a cute little dress.",67515,4
67515,"I'm 5'6"" and it's a liiiiittle short, probably be best as a tunic but if you do wear it as a dress just make sure there's no wind and you don't bend over!",67515,4
67515,"I got the sky blue color, it's slightly more teal than pictured but still a very pretty color.",67515,4
67516,I'm giving this a 4 star because they shouldn't advertise it on such a young infant.,67516,4
67516,"This hat is far too big for my 18 month old (the child I intended it for), luckily I have a 4 year old who fits into it perfectly.",67516,4
67516,The color is beautiful and the hat is nice and thick.,67516,4
67516,"I'm glad I got it, regardless, but they should show it on a 3, 4, or 5 year old, not a baby!",67516,4
67517,"This was a good fit, I got the XL (5' 6""  160lbs).",67517,4
67517,"Sometimes cup size can be a problem (im a solid D cup), but this had plenty of coverage",67517,4
67518,Has held up longer than any of the other brands I've tried.,67518,4
67518,Also doubles as a pocket mirror intil it becomes covered in scratches.,67518,4
67518,Can old a few bills in a card pocket if folded a certain way (think along the lines of a letter).,67518,4
67518,Almost two years later some of the pockets are starting to tear on the edges.,67518,4
67519,They are a little heavier than some others so they slide out of my daughters thin hair but only after movement.,67519,4
67521,Nice jeans just narrow legs and somewhat short length,67521,4
67522,I really am enjoying wearing these toe-socks.,67522,4
67522,"My toes are somewhat crunched so it is hard to put them on, but once on, they are very comfortable, warm enough but not too warm.",67522,4
67522,I have been wearing them at home and to my Qigong class.,67522,4
67522,"My only issue is that I would like them to reach a bit higher on the ankle, to the lower calf.",67522,4
67523,The shirt isn't bad but the material is very thin and its extremely stretchy.,67523,4
67523,But color wise it's the same that was shown in the picture.,67523,4
67524,Nice fit around my junk but small in waist.,67524,4
67524,I like the support for my testicles.,67524,4
67525,Somewhat small in the arms and a little see through (thin material) but over all a nice shirt,67525,4
67526,"For the price, this can't be beat.",67526,4
67526,"Feels like pretty good quality material, size seems true to size (I bought this for my 3yr old who wears 4-5T).",67526,4
67526,The only issue I have is that the colors on the flag are a bit lighter than what is pictured.,67526,4
67526,The red is more of a salmon red/pink color and the blue is more of a denim blue.,67526,4
67526,"Bought this for my son to wear on 4th of July this year (kind of ironic to have a 4th of july shirt not made in america, but what can I say, the price had me).",67526,4
67526,"This shirt is made in China and is shipped from China, so don't expect quick shipping.",67526,4
67526,"I ordered on May 28th, and it arrived by June 11th, so still not bad shipping time.",67526,4
67527,"VERY NICE SLIPPERS, A LITTLE BIG, BUT BETTER THAN TOO SMALL, AS THE CHINESE MADE SHOES I BOUGHT ON AMAZON....WOULD BUY THESE SLIPPERS AGAIN......",67527,4
67528,See through so be mindful of that.,67528,4
67528,"I'm 110 with 24"" waist, got these for the gym but they're too big.",67528,4
67528,Gonna try to shrink them.,67528,4
67530,Just got the item and I love it.,67530,4
67530,Fits perfect only thing is it smells like u have a pound of rubber on you,67530,4
67531,"4 stars due to late shipping, otherwise it's a very nice half set.",67531,4
67531,I get compliments once I wear them,67531,4
67532,My son just got a new pair of Converse size 3 and I ordered these in a size 4.,67532,4
67532,These are smaller than the size 3 Converse.,67532,4
67532,My son also complained about them being narrow and he does not have wide feet.,67532,4
67532,They are super cute but order up at least a full size!,67532,4
67534,will be buying more soon!!,67534,4
67535,Very comfortable shirt !,67535,4
67536,"I received this shirt on time and I was pleased with the quality of the material, but I will have to layer it since it is a little too see through.",67536,4
67536,"This shirt is cute but somewhat large, which I like but you might want to order down.",67536,4
67536,If they had other colors I would order again.,67536,4
67537,"Was quite wrinkled as it arrived folded up, but it was ok.",67537,4
67538,"I didn't receive any suggestions on how often to wear it and when to wear it, so I looked online and found drastically different suggestions for products slightly similar.",67538,4
67538,I ended up just wearing it a few hours every day for the first hour and found that it really did impact how much I ate for the day.,67538,4
67538,I also jogged with it on and found the jogging easier than usual.,67538,4
67538,"Not sure if these are lasting result of this waist trainer, but I definitely am enjoying it!",67538,4
67539,Super cute top for summer and very comfortable.,67539,4
67539,"If you over ate a little...no problem, this shirt does not hug your tummy",67539,4
67540,Just a little thinner than I expected but still very nice,67540,4
67541,Very feminine but very mainstream America print.,67541,4
67542,But it came with a black smudge on the front.,67542,4
67542,I had to scrub it pretty hard to get it off,67542,4
67543,"Not embroidered, but thats what another review said and I still bought it.",67543,4
67543,It fits nicely and is very soft.,67543,4
67543,Its a Hanes branded Crew Neck.,67543,4
67544,I did my search listing 'women's sweatpants' and this came a little large...,67544,4
67544,I'm sure it's a man's sizing.,67544,4
67544,In fact it slips off my left foot when walking without shoes... bummer!,67544,4
67544,"But it's comfy, pretty blue color (that is pictured) and warm, which is what I wanted.",67544,4
67545,It's very long so we made a bracelet out of the excess and Joe has a nice chain for his wallet.,67545,4
67546,The cup is adorable but big and heavy!,67546,4
67547,Good value for money but I cannot see it!!!,67547,4
67547,When the hand is on any of the lines *I cannot see even with glasses on!!!,67547,4
67547,So perfect for someone with perfect sight but not for anyone shortsighted!!,67547,4
67547,I had to give away...........,67547,4
67548,These are good fitting pants.,67548,4
67548,"I was a little nervous regarding shrinkage based on other reviews, but didn't find this to be an issue.",67548,4
67548,I have black and blue pair - both fit well.,67548,4
67548,I can wear an 8 or 10 in pants.,67548,4
67548,I am 151 and 5'4.,67548,4
67548,The size 8 in these were perfect.,67548,4
67548,"They do have a bit of a 'sheen' to them, but nothing freaky looking.",67548,4
67548,My only complaint - I have washed several times now  (at least 18 times) -  and the elastic threads within the material are actually beginning to stick out of the material.,67548,4
67548,Mainly around the seams of the pants.,67548,4
67548,"I tried pulling them out, but they are within the material itself
 It is VERY noticeable so I now need to wear the pants with long shirts.",67548,4
67548,- but prior to this - the pants were excellent,67548,4
67549,"Great purchase, like that I can fit it under my clothes",67549,4
67550,"Cute, fits a little snug, but great for lounging!",67550,4
67551,"Be warned while this is an awesome necklace, it is quite big.",67551,4
67552,Cute and comfy for my girls.,67552,4
67552,"Nice to have a functioning drawstring, but quite long/large based on amazon size charts.",67552,4
67553,"So, I look at all the other reviews prior to purchasing and decided to give this outfit a try regardless.",67553,4
67553,"For the price, my expectations low to avoid disappointment.",67553,4
67553,"When it arrived, my first impression was that the material was noting like what is pictured.",67553,4
67553,The picture look like cotton/polyester type but the actual fabric is chiffon as it clearly states in the description.,67553,4
67553,So my advise is be mindful of your underwear color choices (strictly black undies only in my case).,67553,4
67553,"The stitching quality was somewhat poor in some areas but again, for the price I somewhat expected that.",67553,4
67553,"I ordered a size XL seeing that most people reported that it ran small, I usually wear large.",67553,4
67553,"When you take it straight out the package and put it on, you'll probably be like WTF is this (the orange look like I escaped from prison)....but after adding some contrast accessories, belting the waist and pinning up the leg ruffles, it came alive.",67553,4
67553,I actually like this lil outfit.,67553,4
67553,Hope this helps :),67553,4
67554,Read product description I thought this was a whole one piece bathing suit.,67554,4
67554,"It is not, just a cover up.",67554,4
67554,Very beautiful though and felt comfortable wearing it as I am on the bigger size of things.,67554,4
67555,Just recieved it today and my daughter tried it on.,67555,4
67555,It fits her perfectly!,67555,4
67555,Although the heart on the headwrap is smaller than pictured.,67555,4
67555,"Other than that, fabric is soft.",67555,4
67555,"Leggings is a little thin, but it's alright.",67555,4
67555,Would recommend this product.,67555,4
67556,It is beautiful and it fits nicely on my daughters ear.,67556,4
67556,The only reason for four stars is that it arrived with one of the pearls loose in the box and I had to get some super glue to glue it back on.,67556,4
67557,"Good looking, but weak chain..pulls apart with a mild tug.",67557,4
67558,A very impressive wallet arrives in some impressive packaging to match.,67558,4
67558,I gifted it to a male friend he thought it was great.,67558,4
67559,"The bracelet is pretty, but the fit was small.",67559,4
67559,"I am very petite and have tiny hands; so, for me to say a piece of jewelry is small, believe that it is true.",67559,4
67559,The bracelet arrived quickly - Thank You!!,67559,4
67559,"However, I had to push the ring flat because it was bent at a point.",67559,4
67559,I have a small child and didn't want to poke his eye out with the tip pointing up like a dagger.,67559,4
67559,I was also able to wear this for about a week before it caught on a counter and broke.,67559,4
67559,"Since I have jewelry making tools and links, I can fix it plus alter it to fit my already tiny hands.",67559,4
67560,I was surprised I liked this as much as I did.,67560,4
67560,I like this brand.,67560,4
67560,Fits nice while covering figure flaws.,67560,4
67560,I will buy this brand again from Amazon.,67560,4
67561,I bought two of these... one for my two year old and one for my six year old.,67561,4
67561,The hat for my two year old was much too big.,67561,4
67561,The hat for my six year old seemed to fit much better.,67561,4
67561,"The ""mustache strap"" kept unbuttoning from the hat, which was frustrating at times, but I do like the concept of this hat.",67561,4
67562,This dress fits so well & looks very professional.,67562,4
67562,The material is great as well.,67562,4
67562,I wish they have more colors.,67562,4
67562,I will buy all of them.,67562,4
67564,Lace 13 was super small- xl looked like a size small.,67564,4
67564,"the first white checked one, however, fit beautifully.",67564,4
67564,Worth the money overall- and shipping took less than a week!,67564,4

At first, I was confused as to what it was when it finally arrived.",67566,4
67566,( Takes about two to three weeks to get to me)  Picture shown and the acual item may be slightly different.,67566,4
67566,It looks just like a bracelet or necklace.,67566,4
67566,I have it on right now and it is quite light and look nice on my foot.,67566,4
67566,"I give a four star rating due to a lengthy shipping process however, product is well made and look beautiful on my foot.",67566,4
67567,The item is beautiful but not what I expected.,67567,4
67567,I believe advertising is misleading.,67567,4
67567,"Item states it's stedl boned, it's not.",67567,4
67567,"I wanted steal boned for very specific reason, which this item is not, even though it's advertised as such.",67567,4
67568,"Cute and comfy, but make sure whatever shirt you're wear doesn't pull up the top layer of lace because the layer of material under the lace and very see through.",67568,4
67569,the print could be a better quality,67569,4
67570,Great buy-puffy so you can stay completely warm,67570,4
67571,Great fabric and color!,67571,4
67571,Looks way more expensive than it is.,67571,4
67571,Would have given 5 stars it is wasn't slightly small.,67571,4
67571,I wear it unbuttoned like a jacket with a tan tank top beneath so it still looks great with my dark blue jeans.,67571,4
67572,These shoes are exceptionally cute and do provide good support.,67572,4
67572,I have planters faciitis and the shoe was great for arch support.,67572,4
67572,I did notice that after wearing them for several hours that my little toe was rubbing on the strap and caused it to turn a little red.,67572,4
67572,"However, they do provide Velcro to make it a little looser.",67572,4
67572,Hopefully this works and I can wear the shoes for a longer period of time.,67572,4
67574,Great to wear when tanning.,67574,4
67574,Shipping was a little slow but overall very pleased with the product.,67574,4
67575,Exactly what I wanted!,67575,4
67576,We are a big fan of Yellow Box flop flops.,67576,4
67576,They last a long time and feel amazing.,67576,4
67576,"These however, seem to be rather loose across the top of her feel.",67576,4
67576,What I mean is they seem to be for a larger maybe wider foot.,67576,4
67576,Never had this problem before.,67576,4
67576,They were a great price and I won't send them back.,67576,4

67577,"Very pretty, but ran a bit small.",67577,4
67577,Not surprised for the price.,67577,4
67577,I was planning on losing a few pounds anyway.,67577,4
67579,can't wait to wear this in Trinidad next month,67579,4
67580,The straps on the bottoms are not as wide as shown in the picture and I felt it was smaller then expected I went with the size chart when ordering.,67580,4
67580,I could deal with the bottoms but too afraid the top will slide off.,67580,4
67580,The quality itself is nice though just watch your curves when ordering,67580,4
67581,"swimsuit looks good on the body, thanks.",67581,4
67582,"It's a very nice dress; however, you need to order at least 2 sizes bigger than what you need.",67582,4
67582,I ended up gifting mine to our babysitter because it was way too small.,67582,4
67583,The product is better than the picture.,67583,4
67583,The blue is vibrant without about being to much !,67583,4

67586,"I am 5'8, 158 pounds, long legs, 34c bra and curvy but not in that ""fat"" way.",67586,4
67586,"The large did not quite cut it as even though it fit, there is a piece of material that is loose and designed to cover you back skin under the lacing in the back.",67586,4
67586,"When the laces are too fat apart, the material will not quite cover your skin and looks bad.",67586,4
67586,I liked the quality a LOT and for that price even more so.,67586,4
67586,"However, it does flatten your boobs somewhat and I want more of that pumped up look.",67586,4
67587,"Can fit iphone6, but barely.",67587,4
67588,Swim suit is nice color was exactly like the picture and it fit nice.,67588,4

67595,I'm 5ft 3 and and 107 pounds.,67595,4
67595,"The  bottom fit perfectly, however the top was very loose.",67595,4
67595,It didn't lay on my chest like it should have.,67595,4
67595,I think it's partly because I'm an A cup and my height.,67595,4
67595,I got a friend to take about 3-4 inches off the back straps and it fits perfectly.,67595,4
67595,The quality is great.,67595,4
67595,Can't wait to wear it!,67595,4

67601,Just what I needed!,67601,4
67601,Just wished it was a little cheaper.,67601,4
67602,"Good quality but unfortunately to large,  will exchange",67602,4
67603,Excellent blue wool cap and a fraction of what I expected to pay for same.,67603,4
67603,It goes well with my pale blue winter coat.,67603,4

67604,The blue is also very vibrant.,67604,4
67604,I can't comment on how this holds up in the wash but so far I'm happy.,67604,4

67605,The orthotics were so thick that I couldn't fit my shoes on my foot.,67605,4
67605,I will be returning and trying the Powerstep SlimFit 3/4 length.,67605,4
67606,It is the look I'm looking for but it is a gift for my mother for Christmas so I will not be able to know how it functions well after December.,67606,4
67606,My mother loves owls.,67606,4
67607,"I had a different one of these I had bought at Walmart a few years back, it was thick and super fluffy then it came up missing.",67607,4
67607,So I began my search for a new one.,67607,4
67607,"The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's not as thick and fluffy as I'd like it to be, but it works...I really like the button at the top that's one thing the one from Walmart didn't have",67607,4
67608,"should work ok, instructions are a little strange as the needle is installed already, but for quick fixes, should work fine",67608,4
67609,Material somewhat cheesy but still a fun hat.,67609,4
67609,Would def purchase again!,67609,4
67610,But they come off after a while as they degrade with wear.,67610,4
67610,"But for the money, they are a good buy.",67610,4
67610,"Would like to be able to get multiples of one size,  as I don't use some sizes.",67610,4
67611,Wonderfully soft and comfy!,67611,4
67612,Only issue is sand collects within mesh and is very difficult to get it out & shorts ride up :-/ but it's gorgeous and I get so many compliments on it!,67612,4
67613,"It is delivered so fast, but it is somewhat bigger that I expexted.",67613,4
67614,"I really love this dress, but it's way too big for me!",67614,4
67614,"Large is the only size available in white so I got it, but a medium or even possibly a small would fit much better.",67614,4
67614,"I guess I'll just keep it, and maybe re-gift it to someone else!",67614,4
67614,"For reference, I'm 5'10 175lbs.",67614,4
67614,"Order down 1 to 2 sizes if you can, ladies!",67614,4
67615,"Fits like a glove, lots of compliments",67615,4
67616,I have big boobs so it is somewhat small.,67616,4
67616,But I love this top and I wear it often.,67616,4
67617,"Should have got a 2XLT, but shirt is comfortable and fashionable!",67617,4
67618,Swim diapers always run small.,67618,4
67618,my daughter wears 2T and I ordered 3T.,67618,4
67618,The 3T fit great.,67618,4
67618,I'd say go a size up and you should be fine.,67618,4
67619,I know I have large calves!,67619,4
67619,Socks are hard to get on but once on are very comfortable.,67619,4
67619,They do just what I need.,67619,4
67619,I am able to wear them about 6-8 hours a day.,67619,4
67619,Then they become uncomfortable just under the knee.,67619,4
67620,I like it but I would have gotten a size smaller than what I was.,67620,4
67622,"Extremely cute, It runs a little small so I would suggest ordering a size larger.",67622,4
67622,But this romper is super cute and I received tons of compliments on it.,67622,4
67622,I would definitely purchase another one (just maybe a bigger size).,67622,4
67623,I love the pattern..this sweater was just not as soft as I'd like it,67623,4
67624,"If you're petite, you will fit into it just fine.",67624,4
67624,"I'm 5'3 and weight about 130, and it fit me like a shirt.",67624,4
67624,The quality is semi decent.,67624,4
67624,The thong that it comes with doesn't even go on correctly.,67624,4
67624,I'll enjoy what I can with it.,67624,4
67625,"My daughter wears a size 4 in big Kids so I got a size 4.5 and they fit as expected, room for growth.",67625,4
67626,It arrived very fast.,67626,4
67626,"I like it a lot and my wife said she really likes it too, looks even better then the picture.",67626,4
67627,Bigger than I thought.,67627,4
67627,Definitely faker than I thought.,67627,4
67627,Other than that it's nice .,67627,4
67628,So disappointed in the smallness of the sizing.,67628,4
67628,"The fabric was a little thicker and richer than other tops I have tried here on Amazon, and I was sorry to have to send it back.",67628,4
67628,The grey was gorgeous.,67628,4
67629,"The scarf is very true to color and design, I just wish it was a little longer.",67629,4
67629,"The only issue I have, and the reason its lost a star, is the metal around the stone is a little jagged and catches on clothing, it should be easy enough to shave down though.",67629,4
67630,"It was a little thight, but quality was perfect.",67630,4
67632,This scarf is soft & well made in appearance.,67632,4
67632,"A bit lighter weight than I expected, but it will still do the job.",67632,4
67632,It arrived quickly & was adequately packaged.,67632,4
67632,I only give it 4 stars because I wish it were a bit heavier in weight.,67632,4
67634,Just be aware that hollow means unlined... You can see straight through the front.,67634,4
67634,Order something like this to go underneath (backless slip)Ayliss Women Sexy Stretch Bodycone Backless Spaghetti Strap Dress Burgundy L https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00W967NRQ/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_k6W5xbAH6RVDJ,67634,4
67635,"beautiful charm, with good workmanship, sufficient diameter to Pandora bracelet.",67635,4
67637,I thought I ordered a large but I actually got a Medium and it fit a little bit loose but still very cute and flattering!,67637,4
67638,Hey are snug and fit good,67638,4
67639,I got this in two colors.,67639,4
67639,"Really cute, but doesn't breathe that well.",67639,4
67639,Not so good for really hot nights.,67639,4
67640,Very comfortable and soft on the inside.,67640,4
67640,My daughter won't take it off!,67640,4
67640,Have not washed it yet so hopefully it will not shrink.,67640,4
67641,Lovely fabric and great fit,67641,4
67642,"If this picture was of me, the socks would go up to the pants, but I know I have short legs.",67642,4
67642,"They're really nice looking, a little tight at the top of the thighs, but otherwise warm and comfy.",67642,4
67643,"It arrived sooner than estimated (by several days), looks good, fits well, and I love how low-profile the buckle is.",67643,4
67644,I'm 5'7 and it hits more mid thigh than lower thigh.,67644,4
67644,But will definitely still wear it.,67644,4
67645,I ordered up 2 sizes from my normal sizing (I'm a medium in the USA) and ordered an XL.,67645,4
67645,Seems to be a good choice especially for the price.,67645,4
67645,I't going to go great in the summer with a pair of jeans and sandals,67645,4
67646,This little magnet makes my life so much easier.,67646,4
67646,I am complemented on it all the time.,67646,4
67646,The magnet is very strong and it helps keep my glasses out of harms way.,67646,4
67648,A Little small buy they look good,67648,4
67649,"Love them, I've bought many pairs just wish the would last longer",67649,4
67651,it's hurt when you wear it for long period of time.,67651,4
67651,but will recommend it ..it does the job,67651,4
67652,These insoles provide really great padding for the bottoms of my feet.,67652,4
67652,They fit very nicely inside all my shoes without having to remove the original insole.,67652,4
67652,The only problem I have is that the arch support is kind of in a weird place on my foot.,67652,4
67652,It supports the arch closer to the heel of my foot when I need support closer to front pad (I wish I knew foot anatomy better to be able to describe this).,67652,4
67652,Overall they were fine.,67652,4
67652,"I probably wouldn't buy these again, but I don't regret buying them either.",67652,4
67653,"I love the rose gold color, and minimalist style, but the font was different (more manly style)than the original picture, and slightly off center.",67653,4
67654,It fits fairly well.,67654,4
67654,The sleeves are too tight but the custom measurements fit me in a custom manner--very nice.,67654,4
67654,I recommend telling them an inch larger in the sleeves.,67654,4
67655,A little bit small and shrinks when washed.,67655,4
67655,But I rarely need to wear something warm here in sunny california.,67655,4
67655,They actuall fit better on my arms to protect my arms from wind and cold but not so heavy that they get too warm.,67655,4
67655,"Seems like they are made for small Asian women so if I were you, get a size or two larger.",67655,4
67655,"The thickness is medium thin, not like the real heavy thick ""leg warmers"" that are out there.",67655,4
67655,"But for the price, you can't beat it if all you want is a little bit more warmth on your legs or arms.",67655,4
67655,They cover my jeans without being over stretched but I am a small person.,67655,4
67656,More cream than white.,67656,4
67656,"Nice top, I really like it.",67656,4
67657,"The 6month, option in the drop down menu, is the 9-18month hat.",67657,4
67657,my 4 month old has a bigger then average head so i ordered that for him.,67657,4
67657,Never the less it still worked out because the adjustment still accommodated to fit his head.,67657,4
67657,I just wished I would have more option on color considering the 9-18 month drop down did have a bigger selection available.,67657,4
67658,just a little thicker than previous ones so I can only wear with limited shoes at hand.,67658,4
67659,"Nice shirt, but I wish the print continued to the back.",67659,4
67660,Kept one for myself and gave two as gifts.,67660,4
67661,"Cute shirt, material is thin, though.",67661,4
67662,Overall great dress for the price...,67662,4
67663,This dress runs small.,67663,4
67663,I would normally wear a large but ordered XL based on other reviews.,67663,4
67663,"I'm 5'5"" and about 160# with D cup girls.",67663,4
67663,"Fabric is nice, soft, not paper  thin.",67663,4
67663,Overall- a good buy.,67663,4
67664,Nice color but the bow was sown on awkwardly.,67664,4
67665,"This is a beautiful top, however the front and back points are off center.",67665,4
67666,"Nice, rather thin hat for the fall season.",67666,4
67666,Feels like a cotton knit.,67666,4
67666,It's a bit slouchy so you can wear it several different ways.,67666,4
67666,"If you have a small head, this might not work for you.",67666,4
67666,My head gets hot with most winter hats so I really like this light weight chapeau.,67666,4
67666,I bought multiple colors to go with my various coats.,67666,4
67667,"it's a bit short in the torso, but the fabric is nice",67667,4
67668,Exactly as we expected.,67668,4
67668,40% less $ than anywhere else we shopped at home and online.,67668,4
67669,"Very cute, sleeves are a little tight other than that very nice",67669,4
67670,I like overall tad big on calves legs,67670,4
67672,Great look and quality.,67672,4
67672,Too tight around the thighs though so I had to return them.,67672,4
67673,The bathing suit looks just as pictured.,67673,4
67673,Very sexy but it runs two sizes too small.,67673,4
67673,I am 5'4'' and 120lbs.,67673,4
67673,"I typically wear a small in tops and bottoms, sometimes medium top because I have a 32DD chest.",67673,4
67673,I ordered a medium based on reviews of other suits by this maker.,67673,4
67673,Should have ordered a large.,67673,4
67673,It is of course tiny in the chest but also in the length and I am not tall!,67673,4
67673,I would definitely recommend the suit but go bigger on size.,67673,4
67674,Looks and feels like the real thing.,67674,4
67674,Great color and texture.,67674,4
67674,My daughter absolutely loved it.,67674,4
67675,I wanted this choker because it looks just like Ariana Grande's choker in her music video for Dangerous Woman.,67675,4
67675,"It isn't the most quality metal on the clasp, so I can't wear it and break out any kind of sweat.",67675,4
67675,The clasp is also not that secure and has come apart a few times.,67675,4
67675,I've been able to pop the links back into place.,67675,4
67676,"Water proof and wind proof are great, but not very good for extreme cold weather in Minnesota.",67676,4
67676,My fingers are freezing.,67676,4
67677,"Delivered on time,,great fit,very comfortable",67677,4
67678,"It looks like the picture, well made and even the color looks awesome!",67678,4
67678,But it is too small for me to wear; like 2 or 3 sizes smaller.,67678,4
67678,I'll have to give it away... not happy about that =(,67678,4
67680,the dress is beautiful sadly it runs small so i had to return,67680,4
67682,"It was just what I was looking for, great for a cheap price.",67682,4
67683,"I am 5.5"" tall, 145lbs.",67683,4
67683,I bought an US M size and fits well.,67683,4
67683,"The quality is okay, material is thin but looks good overall.",67683,4
67684,It's nice pretty and easy to put on.,67684,4
67684,Worth the money but it takes for ever for u to received it.,67684,4
67685,Unfortuantely the length of the swim suit isn't provided.,67685,4
67685,The torso is about two inches too short.,67685,4
67685,It's a beautiful suit but will not work on my 5'5 145lb frame.,67685,4
67685,"I ordered a size XL, which fit perfect everywhere else.",67685,4
67685,I wished this would have worked.,67685,4
67685,"The seller gave a refund, which was much appreciated.",67685,4
67686,Very helpful motivation for my toddler.,67686,4
67686,"He's slender and wears, at most, a 3T (and that's usually for length) but the 4Ts were definitely the right size here.",67686,4
67688,"The small fit my 5'4"" 115 lb girlfriend perfectly.",67688,4
67688,"Skirt is very short and the material is kind of cheap, but it looked good.",67688,4
67689,just what I wanted,67689,4
67690,"Good product, serves the purpose.",67690,4
67690,"Initially could not wear them but for 10 minutes and tried Samurai brand first for two weeks to get my arches acquainted, and then switched to this brand, and have kept them on my sneakers ever since.",67690,4
67692,"Ordered Small ( am 5' 1"" ) nice clothes with the self tie belt..it is figure flattering!!",67692,4
67692,(just need to pin the colar because it has no button),67692,4
67693,"Lovely, though it's a little snug on my wrist.",67693,4
67693,Probably more suitable for a younger or smaller person.,67693,4
67695,"Takes some effort to close them around the nipple, but once on they stay on",67695,4
67696,It seemed a bit bigger in the picture but over all great back pack!,67696,4
67697,"I ordered the purple skirt, size medium.",67697,4
67697,I am 5'3 and it came just above the knee.,67697,4
67697,"The material was really nice, a sort of heavy fabric.",67697,4
67697,"I would have kept it, but the shade of purple was too light for what I needed it for, so I ended up returning it.",67697,4
67697,Returning this product was very easy.,67697,4
67697,I would buy from them again.,67697,4
67698,"They are a nice tight fit, but he says they stretch out a bit as the day goes on.",67698,4
67698,Would love if they stayed a tight fit.,67698,4
67699,"not 'wow' effect, but I cannot say it's low quality
sleeves are long enough for 183cm height but not super-long
it hides your fifth point and looks pretty stylish",67699,4
67700,These are so comfy and look great under long tank tops and/or short dresses.,67700,4
67700,The red color is actually bright red like I was hoping!,67700,4
67700,Great for the price.,67700,4
67700,The only small complaint I have is the rhinestone button..looks a little cheap but I don't plan on wearing these with anything that will show it off anyways,67700,4
67701,I am really enjoying it.,67701,4
67702,"I like the color, size, and lots of pockets.",67702,4
67702,"It's good but not ""extremely soft""",67702,4
67703,"Works just great, and looks great doing it too!",67703,4
67704,I loved it .,67704,4
67704,Got a lot complainment when I wear this .,67704,4
67704,I'm normally a small but I order a medium base on the review and I glad I did.,67704,4
67705,great deal for the price & love the color.,67705,4
67705,I do have narrow feet so I don't know how these will work for most women.,67705,4
67707,Very cute and soft.,67707,4
67707,"However, the stitching on some of the bands was missing on some of the bands that hadn't even been worn yet.",67707,4
67707,So I had to fix them.,67707,4
67708,"Love this bag, just wish that there was a separate hook for the longer strap.",67708,4
67708,It hooks on the handles diagonally so it crosses a little more.,67708,4
67710,Love the color and when I first got it love the fit.,67710,4
67710,Washed once now its two sizes smaller.,67710,4
67711,I always laugh when they say thigh highs because they never are.,67711,4
67711,"I don't think my legs are especially long, especially my calves but yet these always stop right around the knee or just above.",67711,4
67711,"Maybe because I have muscle in my legs, I don't know.",67711,4
67711,"27"" inseam, athletic calves and quads.",67711,4
67713,"I actually really liked this swimsuit, the only thing that was a tad uncomfortable was the bottoms bc they don't have a lot of buttocks coverage.",67713,4
67714,"I had a last minute event, so of course I turned to Amazon to save the day!",67714,4
67714,I was very impressed with this dress.,67714,4
67714,"I'm 5'5"" and I wish it was 2 inches longer.",67714,4
67714,My shoes poked out just a lil too much for my liking.,67714,4
67714,"But besides that, it fit perfectly and the neck-line def turns heads if you are fuller up top!",67714,4
67714,"If I ever need a dress in the future, I would definitely consider this brand again.",67714,4
67714,Just have a steamer on hand as it does arrive too wrinkles to wear straight out of the bag!,67714,4
67715,I was disappointed when I opened it because I ordered white and received a khaki color.,67715,4
67715,That's the only reason I rated it 4 stars.,67715,4
67715,I still thought it was pretty so I started wearing it.,67715,4
67715,It does feel a little tight in the shoulders but I can still wear it.,67715,4
67715,I ordered extra large because of the reviews.,67715,4
67715,I usually wear medium..,67715,4
67715,"Very warm and soft and you can take the liner out if you don't need it, which also makes it perfect as a raincoat!!",67715,4
67715,I have had lots of compliments on it as well.,67715,4
67715,You need this coat..,67715,4
67716,"It is the largest size, but I wish it were a bit larger.",67716,4
67716,Other than that it is great!,67716,4
67717,"It's good material, not sheer.",67717,4
67717,The top is not as snug as if like bit bits not 'too' big.,67717,4
67718,"It's nice, wearable,  but nothing special,  the makers could have smoothed it out better when it came out of the mold I guess.",67718,4
67719,My son needed a bow tie to go with his Easter outfit.,67719,4
67719,I ordered this to match his shirt.,67719,4
67719,It is a darker yellow than I expected but actually blends in with his shirt.,67719,4
67719,It is adjustable and snaps and stays in place.,67719,4
67719,I like how it will grow with him.,67719,4
67719,It is a nice material and well made.,67719,4
67719,I love how nice it looks on him!,67719,4
67720,But the metal rings do leave rust colored stains.,67720,4
67720,Not terrible but it is noticeable.,67720,4
67721,Love this headbands they're very soft and comfortable.,67721,4
67722,Wish it had a zipper closure.,67722,4
67722,But I like the bag.,67722,4
67722,Sturdy and good quality,67722,4
67723,We will see .,67723,4
67723,This is a gift for my grandson's birthday the end of July.,67723,4
67725,"LOVE these earrings but gave them as a gift, could not keep them as they are TOO HEAVY for my ears :(
VERY COOL earrings though!!!",67725,4
67725,"If weight is not an issue for you, then buy these!!",67725,4
67726,Only wish it was 100% cotton or lessor polyester content; great color.,67726,4
67727,"My personal size is between a L & XL and their L fit me fine, thanks to the elastic waistband.",67727,4
67727,"If your waist is greater than 38 (US), go for the XL.",67727,4
67728,My husband really likes the tees.,67728,4
67728,Our only con comment is that they could have been just slightly thicker.,67728,4
67728,They are pretty thin.,67728,4
67729,Sexy look and feel.,67729,4
67729,When I reorder I will go two sizes up.,67729,4
67730,They are ok but rub against skin it almost seemed like they are cricked on the strap section.,67730,4
67730,But overall they are good.,67730,4
67732,Not as tall as I would have liked.,67732,4
67732,It cuts my circulation off under my kneecaps.,67732,4
67733,"Slips extremely easily when putting on, almost need a third hand to set it at the right tension without it slipping back out.",67733,4
67733,Not good for carrying anything clipped onto the belt.,67733,4
67734,"Very good quality,great value.",67734,4
67735,"It fit as expected, perfect for a cozy fall evening at home.",67735,4
67736,"Very cute on my toddler, however one complaint is that the pair we received had a bunch of loose strings hanging off of it that we had to cut off.",67736,4
67736,Almost like it wasn't sewn properly.,67736,4
67736,Not thrilled with the quality of Gerber products.,67736,4
67737,"Love that it is adjustable and hard for baby to remove, but still very lightweight..",67737,4
67738,These are really cute thigh high socks.,67738,4
67738,I ordered 5 pair in different colors including black.,67738,4
67738,"They all feel exactly the same and seem to be made of the same stretchy material, which is good.",67738,4
67738,They don't have any troubles staying up on my thigh though I do wish they would stay 2-3 inches higher.,67738,4
67738,I'm tallish and that's just a personal preference though.,67738,4
67738,"These will be really fun to wear for cosplay, Halloween and at home.",67738,4
67738,"Sadly, I'm a bit old to wear these out in a casual setting, even though I would love to.",67738,4
67739,I ordered these for my Tragus.,67739,4
67739,The 6mm was unfortunately too short so I will be needing to buy the 8mm now.,67739,4
67739,I loved the earrings themselves.,67739,4
67740,Roomy enough for me to wear layers.,67740,4
67740,Love the purple color.,67740,4
67740,Lining is warm andc snuggly.,67740,4
67741,I had read reviews that the shoes ran small and I was looking for heeleys in a small size so it worked out great.,67741,4
67741,They probably fit a whole size smaller than listed.,67741,4
67742,a little too expensive for its qualty.,67742,4
67743,I'm 5'4 135 lbs and ordered a medium.,67743,4
67743,I didn't want my butt hanging out.,67743,4
67743,Small would have fit better in chest.,67743,4
67743,Great buy for price.,67743,4
67744,Wash well we do not put these in the dryer.,67744,4
67745,Creates good looking knots.,67745,4
67745,I have better ties but this is a solid tie.,67745,4
67745,"Good color, good pattern, easy to work with.",67745,4
67746,I love this hat and it was extremely worth the price!,67746,4
67746,"I wasn't sure what to expect for the quality of this item since it was so cheap, but it's really great, warm, and comfortable to wear.",67746,4
67746,It's super cute and I love the big puff ball.,67746,4
67746,"It's a little longer than I expected, so it's sort of slouchy, whereas I had thought the puff would sit more toward the top of my head and be more visible.",67746,4
67746,But it still looks great and has a really vibrant kind of watermelon color.,67746,4
67747,Really nice design and just what I neede to replace my old checkbook cover.,67747,4
67747,"The leather is very still making ut a bit unweildy, but I'm sure it'll loosen up with use.",67747,4
67748,"Was the last sizes, to small",67748,4
67749,"Ok, so I needed a new case and this looked like it would meet my needs.",67749,4
67749,"Pros - price is excellent, it arrived quickly, love the clear display for 3 slots of cards, feels great, looks good, and I like that the bottom is open so charging is easier because phone  doesn't need to be removed from case.",67749,4
67749,"Cons - the part that holds the phone is only sides so it's not a secure hold, the magnet doesn't hold it closed so when I close the cover it doesn't cover the phone",67749,4
67750,"I was hesitant in buying after reading the reviews, but i love these shirts.",67750,4
67750,"They fit as expected, I ordered a 2x and they were comfortable.",67750,4
67750,They are not that thin and perfect shirt to be working out in.,67750,4
67750,"If you want more room, I suggest to buy a size larger than you wear.",67750,4
67751,Beautiful dress - but not for any woman with larger bust size.,67751,4
67752,Excellent leather very soft.,67752,4
67752,Its great to hold 2 passport with no problem.,67752,4
67752,Easy to get into credit card holder and license holder after a few time of use.,67752,4
67752,With extra storage under the side for receipts.,67752,4
67752,Great value for the money!,67752,4
67753,"First day I wore it I was 3 days post partum, it was barley closing.",67753,4
67753,In less than.a week it was too big.,67753,4
67753,It would close & be loose.,67753,4
67753,The sizing is very different.,67753,4
67753,Going to purchase a medium but afraid it might be too small.,67753,4
67753,I wear an 18 in pants but my waist is small.,67753,4
67753,A large lasted me 3 days -_-,67753,4
67754,This looks exactly like the picture!!,67754,4
67754,The only flaws are its size.,67754,4
67754,As you can tell from the pictures the size is smaller than an iPhone 6plus.,67754,4
67754,I couldn't fit the phone fully inside and to give you an example of the height I put the iPhone 6plus beside it as well.,67754,4
67754,It came with all its paperwork.,67754,4
67754,For half the cost of the retail it was well worth it and was delivered before the expected time!,67754,4
67755,Need to order 2 sizes larger than you normally wear.,67755,4
67756,"Great hat, lots of sun procreation, feels sturdy, love it.",67756,4
67757,Great product for great price.,67757,4
67757,"The stone was a little smaller than I wouldve like, but cute delicate sparkle.",67757,4

67759,it is good quality for what it is!,67759,4
67760,I Love this hoodie!,67760,4
67760,It's one of my favorites!,67760,4
67762,"Looked great the fit was awesome, I felt sexy in this dress'",67762,4
67763,Gathered at the top so it bunches up a little at the front.,67763,4
67763,Otherwise I like it.,67763,4
67763,"Crisp, lightweight, breathable fabric that washes and dries with minimal wrinkling.",67763,4
67764,The bag was just as described.,67764,4
67764,It is a soft leather and for the price I am amazed at how nice it is.,67764,4
67764,The only thing that bothers me is that it doesn't stand on its own because it's soft.,67764,4
67764,"I have my Lenovo 13"" Yoga laptop, laptop charger, 3 letter size notebooks and 2 small notebook and there is still a bit of.room to spare.",67764,4
67764,With all this inside I can still zip the bag closed for added security (see picture).,67764,4
67764,The color is beautiful.,67764,4
67764,You can't go wrong with this bag.,67764,4
67765,Clips hold reasonably well and patterns are attractive.,67765,4
67766,Wrong size for me.,67766,4
67766,It actually is too large for a person that wears size 8 and is tall.,67766,4
67767,Runs a little small.,67767,4
67767,Dress is extremely long.,67767,4
67767,"I'm 5'3"" and could easily get 3 or 4 inches cut off and re-hem it.",67767,4
67767,Would order another if they had more colors available.,67767,4
67767,Received it way sooner than expected.,67767,4
67768,These are great clear retainers!,67768,4
67768,You can barely see them while in my cartilage piercing!,67768,4
67768,My only complaint is that you have to trim these retainers because they are super long and will stab your head.,67768,4
67769,"This runs a little small, but other than that it is well made and exactly what I wanted.",67769,4
67769,I would definitely not put it in the dryer for a full cycle to avoid shrinkage.,67769,4
67770,Order 2 sizes over what you need,67770,4
67771,It's great to be able to ordered something online and get its true sized.,67771,4
67773,nice shirt for the hawaiian fridays,67773,4
67775,im normally a size 2x-3x in tops and i ordered the size 6x!,67775,4
67775,i could have went a size down but thats okay ill just keep it or give it away ... this corset is kinda short allso .. the bottom of my belly keep poking out .. wish it was a bit longer,67775,4
67776,somewhat small but cute.,67776,4
67777,"Enjoy fit good BUY
Thx
Light Love & Peace
Rev.",67777,4
67780,Made very well but too big for me,67780,4
67781,The only thing that I did not like about this product was that it did not come with a dust bag.,67781,4
67782,"Gave this a 4...love it, it has lots of space and the outside zippers are very handy but the strap is a copper brown....would have been better if it was all black",67782,4
67785,Cheap sewn incorrectly and to loose in front if ya gotem they gonna be seen in this joke,67785,4
67786,I saw this and had to have it.,67786,4
67786,I washed it and wore it once and the white already started to crack.,67786,4
67786,Other than that I still really like it.,67786,4
67787,It's a nice scarf for the $.,67787,4
67788,Great for racquetball they grip the floor very well and very Comfortable,67788,4
67789,I knew this dress was running small after reading the other reviews.,67789,4
67789,"Usually I wear 8 in dress, got the XL and couldn't have made a better choice.",67789,4
67789,Fits like a glove and very form fitting.,67789,4
67789,Not tight to the point that I can't move around but really embrace your body.,67789,4
67789,I'm a bit curvy on the side so it really shows my figure but again I still have room to move around and feel comfortable so ladies don't forget to order up and you will be very pleased.,67789,4
67789,Can't wait to wear this dress.,67789,4
67789,"Exactly as shown on the picture and quality is very good too, kind of a stretchy material.",67789,4
67790,Gave it 4 stars because the shirt faded ALOT after the first wash and then hasn't faded any since.,67790,4
67791,Looks like the picture.,67791,4
67792,"Nice hat, light weight material, appears to be pretty well made but as stated, it is somewhat large.",67792,4
67793,Only disappointment was the ears didn't want to stand up but flopped over instead.,67793,4
67794,I got a few compliments at work.,67794,4
67794,I wear a 9/10 and got the XL.,67794,4
67795,Bought this for my wife.,67795,4
67796,This was under $2.00 shipped so I didn't expect much but it actually is quite pretty for the low price.,67796,4
67796,The tree of life photo is exactly as pictured and the chain is sturdy.,67796,4
67796,"This is definitely NOT sterling silver or even silver plated but it's a cute, cheap necklace that looks pricier and is fun to wear.",67796,4
67796,"I love jewelry and have so much from very inexpensive to very expensive and I feel less nervous when I wear my cheap jewelry because, if it gets lost, I am not out ,much money.",67796,4
67796,"So when I do casual or active things, I throw on costume jewelry.",67796,4
67796,This necklace was already complimented at a grocery store by a complete stranger.,67796,4
67796,I told her it was under $2.00 and she thought I was lying.,67796,4
67796,This ships from China and takes a while to get here but it came much sooner than anticipated.,67796,4
67796,I gave it 4 stars not because it is super high quality but because it is better quality than expected for the very low price.,67796,4
67797,Fits great on our little ones feet.,67797,4
67797,They don't leave indentations or seem to hurt her feet at all.,67797,4
67797,They work great on wet surfaces.,67797,4
67797,She has worn them several times & they don't seem to have worn down at all.,67797,4
67798,"It was okay, will get the job done",67798,4
67799,"Wish you could fit more cards in it, but I really like it.",67799,4
67801,"After going through several plastic ""resin"" bands that usually crack and break within a year, I have found this band to be very comfortable and durable (so far).",67801,4
67801,"It's hard to find a nylon band that doesn't look tacky or cheap, so this one looked nice enough to not draw attention.",67801,4
67801,My only complaint is that the metal loops that hold the excess strap are not movable.,67801,4
67801,"Since my wrist is small, the excess strap sticks out quite a bit beyond the metal loops and looks really bad.",67801,4
67801,"I added a small black rubber o-ring that I could position where I needed it, and it blends in nicely with the watch.",67801,4
67801,"I'm taking a star off for that, because I would have returned it if I had not found a way to fix it on my own.",67801,4
67802,Does a great job of keeping everything in place.,67802,4
67802,The silicon patch is a little high for me so I have to adjust it every time I pull them up.,67802,4
67802,I wish the waist section was a little tighter.,67802,4
67802,"Still, I noticed my stomach shrinking after the first night of wearing it.",67802,4
67804,"They were what I expected,  but a little small.",67804,4
67805,Loved it however the chain broke only a couple days after we had it.,67805,4
67805,Had to get a replacement .,67805,4
67805,The clock still works and otherwise very cute piece.,67805,4
67806,"The product was too small, but the seller refunded the full price.",67806,4
67807,daughter has a narrow foot--these will work for her costume,67807,4
67808,"Fits as expected, not much left to the imagination, however very comfortable to wear",67808,4
67809,"A little bit larger than expected, but great sizing and adequate number of card slots and space for cash to be kept without having to fold before putting in wallet",67809,4
67810,"Even though I could not wear, I loved this top",67810,4
67811,Looks nice but the elastic slips off easily.,67811,4
67812,I like this piece.,67812,4
67814,Really a great stype bag.,67814,4
67814,There are lots of card holders and just perfect room.,67814,4
67814,The inside feels a little cheap i hope it holds up.,67814,4
67815,We were told at work that we now have to wear red tops 3 days a week.,67815,4
67815,"Well, red is not my color people!",67815,4
67815,This was a nice option.,67815,4
67815,It fit as expected and seems to have the stuff to last.,67815,4
67815,"I received loads of compliments and inquiries ""where did you get that shirt, it's so cute?""",67815,4
67815,"Polka dots can be fun, they do make people happy.",67815,4
67815,Scientists should look into that.,67815,4
67815,The polka dot effect.,67815,4
67815,"So yes, good price good quality and accurate fit.",67815,4
67815,"Bright colors, good buttoning.",67815,4
67815,I don't like it when  the buttons slip out of their buttonholes too easily!,67815,4
67815,"In my opinion, you can buy this with confidence.",67815,4
67816,"Cute and fun, but quite long",67816,4
67817,Good Quality for the price.,67817,4
67818,This hat is great for keeping the sun off my face and shoulders on the beach.,67818,4
67818,Depending on the position of the sun it can almost shade both shoulders.,67818,4
67818,My only complaint is the hat is easily pushed up and/or away in higher wind.,67818,4
67818,The normal breeze on the beach does not affect the hat but large gusts flip the hat up and off my head easily.,67818,4
67818,Using the cord lock does help but does not alleviate the issue.,67818,4
67818,"Other than the wind issue, the hat is great and is exactly what I was looking for.",67818,4
67818,I would recommend this product.,67818,4
67819,It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be.,67819,4
67819,( bigger than a half dollar) Good quality though.,67819,4
67819,"Not sure my son will like the size, but it's very nice looking.",67819,4
67820,The romper was nice.,67820,4
67820,The only negative thing is the lining of it was TOO thin so it itched my skin.,67820,4
67820,I returned due to it being itchy and it was meant for a boat ride in the Caribbean.,67820,4
67820,I would have been an itchy mess.,67820,4
67821,Bought this watch with a wood faced watch from another (more expensive) brand.,67821,4
67821,"Here's why this watch made the team with 4 stars:

Price: If you need a quick synopsis, this watch is worth what I bought it at, $20 - maybe more.",67821,4
67821,"5/5

Looks: Good looking watch.",67821,4
67821,Interior wood grain is very nice with the hands and dials completing a clean look.,67821,4
67821,"My biggest complaint is that the black casing sadly doesn't appear to be wood like other watches (maybe it is but without the grain, who cares) and has MILD paint imperfections.",67821,4
67821,Everything else looks fine.,67821,4
67821,"4/5

Quality: Great quality materials; better than the more expensive watch I bought with it.",67821,4
67821,"Thick black leather straps, seemingly strong crystal, and detailed dial pieces.",67821,4
67821,"4.5/5

Warranty: 1-year from purchase only if it's their fault is somewhat useless.",67821,4
67821,"Watch looks like it was made to last that fine, but in case you get a faulty item I suppose it's something.",67821,4
67822,"Met my expectation, although it was kinda short",67822,4
67823,Mines just arrived it looked great!,67823,4
67824,"I ordered this for my niece for her 10th birthday, to go along with a ""fairy"" photo shoot.",67824,4
67824,"The quality is nice for the price, it came nicely packaged, and arrived very quick.",67824,4
67824,"She hasn't seen it yet, but she is going to love it!",67824,4
67824,It's very whimsical and she will feel like a princess!,67824,4
67824,Fits smaller than normal US clothing sizes.,67824,4
67824,I would order up one size.,67824,4
67825,"It is as described, it is modern and elegant at once.",67825,4
67825,"The material is soft, it will require hand washing to last.",67825,4
67825,I liked how it feels sexy with the open design of the front.,67825,4
67825,I give it four stars because I think the sizes run a little small,67825,4
67826,These are good quality but I felt like they don't hold up well.,67826,4
67826,I kept feeling like the panty hose was falling down and that isn't a comfortable feeling.,67826,4
67826,I am impressed though that so far I haven't had any rips and that's after wearing them a full day at least twice.,67826,4
67827,Bought this for my mom.,67827,4
67827,"Didn't realize it was a very light fabric, looks see-through, but my mom tried it on with nothing underneath (except a bra) and it wasn't visible, so that was good to hear.",67827,4
67827,She loves the colour and said it's very cute.,67827,4
67828,A little small in the bust if you are full fugured in the bosom.,67828,4
67829,"My son is a fan of the game, so I decided to find a shirt for him.",67829,4
67829,I only gave it 4 stars because colors weren't as vibrant as pictured.,67829,4
67829,My son was happy though and that's all that matters.,67829,4
67830,The lenses look very clear and seem to be more robust than the original ones (there is no coating that puts on scratches).,67830,4
67830,"The earsocks (the ones i got) are both ""left side"" peaces!?",67830,4
67830,"They fit well but one peace has the branding in the inner side and the other one on the outer side (and the branding is upside down on both) ... and NO, there is no way to flip or rotate them to solve this!!!",67830,4
67830,Finally thanks for the really fast delivery to the other side of the world ;),67830,4
67831,Fun top but the fabric around the snaps is a little scratchy.,67831,4
67832,The smallest size was perfect for my helix piercing but I have no use for the other sizes.,67832,4
67832,Happy that it came with two of each length so I have a back up.,67832,4
67833,I purchase these for my son whose special needs and is not quite Abel to tie his shoes yet.,67833,4
67833,I've been purchasing these for some years.,67833,4
67833,They are perfect for my special needs son.,67833,4
67834,"These glasses are nice and stylish, and flattering to the face.",67834,4
67834,They are reasonably sturdy and well made.,67834,4
67834,"My only comment is that the reading part of the lens comes up quite high, so there is about a 50/50 split between the reading portion and the plano.",67834,4
67834,"This is fine when you are reading, but it's not as easy to walk around in.",67834,4
67834,"So if you want something versatile, ie a pair of sunglasses to run around in and occasionally read something small, these may not be for you.",67834,4
67835,I love these pajama jeans but they were much too large for me I am just very very petite and so disappointed this is really comfortable PJ jeans would have been had they fit me,67835,4
67836,The shoulder strap was too big,67836,4
67837,I received these nicely packaged.,67837,4
67837,"I do have 20, but one of them is missing a ball.",67837,4
67837,I really did like that color.,67837,4
67837,But the product does seem nice.,67837,4
67837,I got these for my rook piercing.,67837,4
67837,I'll update this when I can change the piercing.,67837,4
67838,hard to get it to look like this out of the package but the net keeps it in place before you wear it,67838,4
67839,"Very nice dress, fit was perfect, top is more cream than white, but will still look nice with about any color coordinating shoes.",67839,4
67839,"Also nice stretch fabric and real lace, good length too.",67839,4

67841,Very nice bathing suit.,67841,4

67845,"Super cute, thin material",67845,4
67846,So far so good.,67846,4
67846,I'm glad I went with small/medium despite the sizing chart.,67846,4
67846,I was 145 pre-pregnancy and I'm currently 176 which states I should get large/XL but I went with small / medium.,67846,4
67846,I expected it to be tighter but is very comfortable.,67846,4
67846,Hopefully it helps tighten me up!,67846,4
67847,Giving 4 stars because it is very pretty and i haven't had any of the opening/closing problems others were talking about but it is much bigger than i expected so it doesnt look very nice on :/,67847,4

67853,it's comfortable and fits great!,67853,4
67854,This product runs small.,67854,4
67854,"It is thin material you will need to wear a cami underneath, but I expected that.",67854,4
67854,All in all for the price I consider it a good purchase.,67854,4
67855,"Heel is just a little too tall for me, but these are really cute boots!",67855,4
67855,Definitely worth it to break them in and get used to the height.,67855,4
67855,"The boots feel well made and like they would last for a while, so I am not complaining there :)",67855,4
67856,Great shirt and so cute.,67856,4
67856,"It fit slightly larger than I assumed it would, but it is such a cute shirt; and I am completely happy with the purchase.",67856,4
67857,Good shirt for the price!,67857,4
67858,It looks exactly like it does in the picture.,67858,4
67858,"The fabric is really thin and there's not a slip underneath, but the color and amount of fabric hides it.",67858,4
67858,"It's super long on me (I'm 5'5) and I had to have my mom hem it, but once she did that I've been wearing it during the warmer months of the summer!",67858,4
67858,I've received numerous compliments on it!,67858,4
67859,This is a great hoodie!,67859,4
67859,It's a bit smaller than expected though.,67859,4
67859,I had to return it because my preggo belly couldn't fit in it lol.,67859,4
67859,I was looking for something baggy enough that I could wear during my 3rd trimester.,67859,4
67859,They gave me my refund no problems!,67859,4
67859,I'd buy from them again for sure :),67859,4
67860,"Appears to be the real deal, with a tag in Arabic characters.",67860,4
67860,"Definitely all-cotton, with the pattern woven in.",67860,4
67860,I expect there are better grades: the fabric this one is made of is almost like a mesh.,67860,4
67860,"Has some kind of sizing in the fabric that has a pretty potent stink when new, but a couple of cold-water hand washes with Woolite takes care of that.",67860,4
67860,"Have not measured it, but the 47""x47"" claim seems about right.",67860,4
67862,It's a little big.,67862,4
67862,That's my own fault bc I was afraid that it was not true to size.,67862,4
67862,The Jacket is cute I get lots of compliments.,67862,4
67863,"I ordered a small and I am 5'4"" and 115 pounds.",67863,4
67863,I fits good and is just long enough to be a dress but it is see through so I would only use it with an under shirt or tank top and leggings.,67863,4
67863,Very light weight and pretty.,67863,4
67864,Loves the product until I realized that the hands looked like Mickey Mouse hands...  Not sure if that made me like them more or less...,67864,4
67865,My daughters are big into band and music and they absolutely love their new leggings!,67865,4
67866,"This shirt took a long time to arrive, but it's better than I expected.",67866,4
67866,"Nice material, cute pattern, and a flattering fit.",67866,4
67866,And it reminds me of Hitchcock's The Birds.,67866,4
67866,"I gave it 4 stars not 5 because I ordered a M based on the size chart (34"" chest and122 lbs.)",67866,4
67866,and it's a bit too big.,67866,4
67867,My butt is quite lifted but i love the shaper because its kind of a thong.,67867,4
67867,the bands under the cheeks are too tight so I cut them and add more elastic...,67867,4
67867,I have thick thighs so now its perfect.,67867,4
67868,Looks and works great.,67868,4
67868,Glad it has a strap to keep it on my head for wind.,67868,4
67868,It's a little big of a fit but it'll work.,67868,4
67869,Got for my mother-she really likes it,67869,4
67870,nicely made returned this dress only because it runs small good quality,67870,4

67871,These helped tie my best friend's Halloween costume together wonderfully and the fit was great.,67871,4
67871,"She said they are made for fairly tall people, and were a bit on the thin side, but that aside are wonderful.",67871,4
67872,Keeps legs warm for winter wear.,67872,4
67873,A good fall jacket.,67873,4
67873,Super cool looking too.,67873,4
67873,"Mine had some loose threads, but I just cut them off.",67873,4
67873,"I'm 5'8"" so I went with a small and it fit perfectly.",67873,4
67874,This purse comes rolled up in a wee box all wrinkly.,67874,4
67874,The fabric isn't that nice.,67874,4
67874,It is big and things could be lost in the free-for-all center pocket.,67874,4
67874,I do think it would be a good purse for traveling as you can fit a lot of crap in there.,67874,4
67875,This is a good purchase.,67875,4
67875,My loves and wears it wherever she goes.,67875,4
67875,"I would only note that the adhesive may sometimes get a little sticky to the skin, but overall good product.",67875,4
67876,Hat is stiff and looks good.,67876,4
67876,I would like it if the screening blocked a little more of the sunlight.,67876,4
67876,The bead on the string is just a passive bead.,67876,4
67876,I replaced it with the spring loaded bead from the hat I replaced.,67876,4
67877,Nice shirt but it tends to roll at the bottom,67877,4
67878,"The clasp can be difficult to open out of the box, but a touch of oil fixes that.",67878,4
67880,Only wish that they had the black available.,67880,4
67880,"Seems like when they have a good item, they run out of it and don't reorder.",67880,4
67881,I bought this to use in my daith piercing.,67881,4
67881,You can wear it with the gems facing out or in if you don't want them showing.,67881,4
67882,I love my skirt!,67882,4
67882,"The quality was better than I expected, though I do wish it had pockets.",67882,4
67882,I would definitely buy again,67882,4
67883,The color is not royal purple as shown in the picture but blue as written in the description.,67883,4
67883,It is clearly a bright electric blue not even remotely purple so do not think when the seller says blue that you are getting anything other than that!,67883,4
67883,The jacket definitely runs small.,67883,4
67883,"I am 5'4"", 145 and purchased the Large and it fit without any extra room.",67883,4
67883,It washes well and did not shrink.,67883,4
67883,"Had to iron the packing creases out but if you take it out of a low dryer immediately upon completion of the dry cycle, you can easily just hang and wear with no ironing necessary.",67883,4
67883,Sleeves are 3/4 length and cut is stylized not classic.,67883,4
67883,Since I bought it as a costume piece it was a perfect purchase.,67883,4
67884,Good quality and very adorable but definitely fit a full size too small from standard sizing,67884,4
67885,Gave it to my sister-in-law for Christmas she loved it,67885,4
67886,What a handy item and a lifesaver if you ever work on watchbands.,67886,4
67886,Sooner or later you will lose one of these watch spring bars and this kit has a broad range of sizes.,67886,4
67886,"However, the tape they sealed the plastic container with leaves a lot of glue residue that is REAL sticky.",67886,4
67886,I had to use 'Goof Off' to remove it.,67886,4
67887,"Description says Asian sizing, must be bigger Asians.",67887,4
67887,Still nice and very stretchy.,67887,4
67888,Nice but somewhat small,67888,4
67889,"FYI these are for people with medium to high arch...if you have a low arch you want to purchase these<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sof-Sole-Airr-Orthotic-Full-Length-Performance-Shoe-Insoles-Men-s-Size-13-14/dp/B0050NVVD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sof Sole Airr Orthotic Full Length Performance Shoe Insoles, Men's Size 13-14</a>",67889,4
67890,with my sons feet growing daily perfect price and fit,67890,4
67891,"I buy these for my son, because his feet turn in.",67891,4
67892,It fit as expected.,67892,4
67892,The compression was gentle enough to not hurt after surgery but firm enough to pull everything together.,67892,4
67892,I was able to wear it a couple days post partum and am just now too small for it at 1 month post partum.,67892,4
67892,"I'm bummed they don't have ""extra small"" because I'd love to keep wearing one, the incision area still hurts without compression!",67892,4
67892,"To give an idea of size/fit: I'm 5'3 with a small frame, my immediate post partum weight was 117lbs, I am 103lbs currently and my pre pregnancy weight was 93lbs.",67892,4
67893,really liked this product.,67893,4
67893,"I have not washed it yet so I cannot comment on the durability of the fabric,  but it looks good and fits exactly as it should.",67893,4
67894,You get what you pay for; cute shirt but the fabric is more synthetic feeling than it looks in the picture.,67894,4
67894,It fits a little large.,67894,4
67895,This is a beautiful bag.,67895,4
67895,"Soft, comfortable to carry.",67895,4
67895,"Well made, zippers are good quality metal, stitching is nice, attractive and looks like it will hold up indefinitely.",67895,4
67895,The lining is nice and pretty.,67895,4
67895,It's a perfect size - roomy enough for everything I like to carry but small enough to be carried as a clutch.,67895,4
67895,I believe this is is a combination of leather and a man made leather material.,67895,4
67895,It is beautiful in any case.,67895,4
67895,The only complaint I have is the shoulder strap.,67895,4
67895,The wrist strap is very nice but the shoulder strap isn't put together well.,67895,4
67895,There's a line of  a white sticky substance that runs the entire length of the strap.,67895,4
67895,It looks cheap and I don't believe it's leather.,67895,4
67895,It has fibers pulling loose and it's a paper thin material.,67895,4
67895,I would like a replacement for this strap as I do want to use it.,67895,4
67895,If that's not acceptable then I will be sending it back.,67895,4
67895,"I also bought an identical black bag and it's shoulder strap looks good, it does not have any problems.",67895,4
67896,I'm not a fan of smocked waist dresses but this one fits nicely.,67896,4
67896,"It is a nice length (I'm 5'9"") I bought it to wear to a high school reunion.",67896,4
67896,Unfortunately I only got to wear it once because I left it in a hotel closet and it was stolen.,67896,4
67897,I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEVERAL MORE SLOTS FOR CREDIT CARDS AND PICTURES.,67897,4
67897,OTHERWISE I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.,67897,4
67898,The comb came very quickly.,67898,4
67898,It is a very nice quality for a great price.,67898,4
67898,It looks exactly like the picture.,67898,4
67898,"It's a little bit heavy, especially for my thin hair, but once I style my hair it seems to stay in place.",67898,4
67898,"All in all, it's a great comb.",67898,4
67899,"No english instructions, which I guess makes sense, but I wanted to use it with my yukata instead of just doing a bow tie for my obi.",67899,4
67900,"Fits great , supper fun for Halloween they were just what I was looking for!",67900,4
67900,Only thing is the first day wearing them the leggings croch seams started coming undone but nothing a few stiches couldn't fix!,67900,4
67901,Nice and light weight.,67901,4
67902,This vest is solid for the price.,67902,4
67902,"Unfortunately, I have to return it because I listened to the other reviewers comments on how it ran large.",67902,4
67902,It does not run large.,67902,4
67902,I am a medium in almost everything so I sized up to a large and it's way too big.,67902,4
67902,Get your normal size.,67902,4
67903,This was a really nice piece for the inexpensive price.,67903,4
67905,"Shipped very fast.i like the dress,it's really nice.i'm size 10 and went for 12.it's somewhat big especially the burst.no big deal .I will have it fixed.",67905,4
67906,"Somewhat small, gave it to some friends who liked it.",67906,4
67908,good quality but runs a little small,67908,4
67909,It was a little snugger than I thought it would be but it fit nicely.,67909,4
67909,The garters are pretty difficult to get hooked up but it is well worth it once its on!,67909,4
67910,"They're comfortable, fit well, despite being single sized and are a great shade of burgundy.",67910,4
67911,Cute pajamas at a good price.,67911,4
67912,Should have ordered a large instead.,67912,4
67912,But I really love it.,67912,4
67912,Just didn't want to send it back to exchange for size large and wait again for it.,67912,4
67913,Overall these swim pants have been a good buy.,67913,4
67913,They did fit a little on the small side.,67913,4
67913,"Also, while they do have buttons on one side, which can make it easier putting the pants on, or taking them off, a second set of buttons on the other side would have made them perfect.",67913,4
67913,"They definitely keep everything in though, should an accident occur (they have for us, and we didn't even notice, because it all stayed in).",67913,4
67913,We would buy these again.,67913,4
67914,These are pretty nice!,67914,4
67914,I do wish the fabric was a bit better quality- they're kinda cheap feeling and pretty thin.,67914,4
67914,The pockets almost make up for it though!,67914,4
67915,"Haven't used it yet, but I'm loving the style!",67915,4
67917,4 stars only because they fit perfect as for performance they were very good until they faded only after a month and are rendered useless for blocking out the sun now,67917,4
67918,"It was very pretty and made a nice gift for my niece, it is a little bulky but other than that it has a sparkly faux diamond that looks real.",67918,4
67918,The chain was durable and long enough.,67918,4
67918,This was a nice product,67918,4
67919,there was a tiny rip inside my wallet but other than that i'm very please.,67919,4
67920,"I like it, but it came with scented freshness pack in it that smelled of flowers.",67920,4
67920,I am allergic to certain flowery perfumes and got a major headache.,67920,4
67920,Took a long time to air it out and get that smell out of it...,67920,4
67921,I bought this in addition to my skull earrings and other skull accessories.,67921,4
67921,Looks awesome and goes with almost anything else.,67921,4
67922,Although it is a little short.,67922,4
67922,The material is good and I love the front!,67922,4
67923,Shirts is ok but material is not what I expected.,67923,4
67923,The brand says Helix Pro which I guess is not the real Helix brand.,67923,4
67925,"Really cute bracelet, love how the silver looks on my skin and very easy to put on.",67925,4
67926,Hides imperctions .flattering to curvy bodies.,67926,4
67927,"I does look like the picture, I don't like to much the fabric but the dress is nice and wearable.",67927,4
67928,has a lil bit of a funky smell but nothing a quick wash won't get rid of.,67928,4
67928,My girlfriend loves it!,67928,4
67929,Very pretty but a bit small for a shawl.....Will keep to use with silk scarves,67929,4
67930,Its cute but smaller than expected and some of the hairs are falling out but not too much.,67930,4
67930,Its still worth the buy,67930,4
67931,A little disappointed in fabric the dress is made of but it will serve its purpose,67931,4
67932,"As a 32"" waist I feel that I should have gone with a Large instead of an X-L as this X-L is not as tight as I had hoped.",67932,4
67932,"I do love it still as it helps my stomach to appear much flatter and I have already gotten a few complements on my ""weight loss.""",67932,4
67932,"I mostly bought this product to help with my back which gets chronically sore from the daily grind and this waist trainer seems to make a huge, helpful difference.",67932,4
67932,My back has been much less sore which has helped me to work harder during the day and still feel well enough to get stuff done at home at the end of the day.,67932,4
67932,The material stretches very well and allows one to bend over and sit down comfortably.,67932,4
67932,"Also, an extra benefit to be mentioned is that my appetite seems to be somewhat suppressed which helps me to cut back on eating snacks throughout the day or overeating during meals.",67932,4
67932,"The only reason i docked off one star was because I really wanted something tighter, but their fitment guide was a bit vague",67932,4
67933,This product arrived on time and fits just fine.,67933,4
67933,"It looks exactly as pictured except a bit more green toned, which is what I was hoping for when ordering it in the color mint.",67933,4
67933,"My only complaint is that the skirt part is a bit short for my liking, so I usually pair it with leggings.",67933,4
67933,"All in all, worth the money.",67933,4
67934,"Had a few stray strings on the seams, nothing a quick flame couldn't remedy though.",67934,4
67935,It was great my child love them,67935,4
67936,I was expecting these to come a little higher on the ankle than they did and at first they felt a bit uncomfortable since I'm not used to low shoes.,67936,4
67936,"However after wearing them around the house for a few days, then using them for practice and playing a tournament, they were really comfortable and provided very good support and traction.",67936,4
67936,My feet felt fine they day after the all day tournament so these shoes definitely protected my feet.,67936,4
67936,Great traction as well.,67936,4
67936,I usually wear a size 10 and the Yonnex size 10 fit my foot perfectly.,67936,4
67937,Nice color and style.,67937,4
67938,I bought these to wear with my L.L.,67938,4
67938,I had previously picked up a few pairs of Gold-Toe no-show socks from a local department store.,67938,4
67938,"Problem is, the Gold-Toes became uncomfortable after a few hours because I was unable to figure out a way to adjust my shoes so that the neither slipped off too easily nor exerted uncomfortable pressure on the top of my feet.",67938,4
67938,These no-shows solved many of the problems that I encountered with the Gold-Toes.,67938,4
67938,They're thin but sturdy.,67938,4
67938,"I bought three to start with, and I was so happy with them that I purchased another three.",67938,4
67938,They're not perfect--hence only four stars--because sometimes they too can begin to feel a bit uncomfortable.,67938,4
67938,Yet I'm also able to walk for an hour or so without my feet bothering me.,67938,4
67939,"Perches a little high on my head, but the yellow/tan color is very nice and the styling is great.",67939,4
67939,"A bit of a plastic feel to it, was hoping for the kind made of paper, but it has the same look.",67939,4
67939,"The white one was a little too small for my head and was crushed when I received it, but the vendor is replacing it so, I'm good.",67939,4
67940,Bras are very comfortable.,67940,4
67940,The biggest problem with them is that they are poorly made.,67940,4
67940,"Stiching  is coming out, but mostly the pads do not stay in place.",67940,4
67940,I think they need to be sewn in.,67940,4
67941,Very nice but no sealing glue included.,67941,4
67942,Is this product long or short sleeve?,67942,4
67943,"Silver applique might not last long, it seems to rub off on us when we hold him, but it nice and fits well.",67943,4
67944,Costume fit well (used the sellers recommendations and got an XL when I would normally get a medium or large) and it looks great.,67944,4
67944,The mask is unfortunately useless as the eye holes are too material dense.,67944,4
67944,"None the less, best costume bang for the buck, especially if you buy a separate mask.",67944,4
67945,I bought the 31 waist.,67945,4
67945,They are a tad baggy and a bit long but my waist fits great and they are very comfortable and my wife says they look great on me.,67945,4
67946,Sometimes falls off because of the clasp.,67946,4
67947,"Loved the sweater, but extra small was tight!",67947,4
67947,I am ordering a small.,67947,4
67947,I wanted this for travel!,67947,4
67948,"Ok for the price, not much detail",67948,4
67949,Only giving it a 4 stars because the size was somewhat small and around the waist area it's a little short.,67949,4
67949,Besides that it's a great comfortable jacket for that price range,67949,4
67950,I love this shirt.,67950,4
67950,I always get compliments on it.,67950,4
67950,I'm glad I ordered a large because it runs small.,67950,4
67950,If you want it a little loose order a size or even 2 up!,67950,4
67951,The dress was beautiful but did not flatter my shape.,67951,4
67951,I have a weird one.,67951,4
67951,I have to return it.,67951,4
67952,For the price these things are pretty sweet.,67952,4
67952,They're extremely comfortable and look great.,67952,4
67952,They are a bit thin in places so I'm curious to see how they hold up.,67952,4
67953,"Love the flow of the material as well as the fabrication, My only issue is, I should have ordered a size down.....",67953,4
67954,there decent glasses but just a few months ago I got the same ones that were polarized less dark better for three dollars less,67954,4
67956,This dress is exactly as expected.,67956,4
67956,The fabric is more rayon-like than linen-like.,67956,4
67956,"I bought a slightly larger size so as to look like the model, but I'm 5'1"" and the 4 would have been a ""perfect"" fit.",67956,4
67956,"Overall, a nice peasant-type dress for bohemian chicks.",67956,4
67957,This produce was exactly as described and I consistently get compliments when I wear it!,67957,4
67957,The first product I received had a smashed face.,67957,4
67957,I contacted the company and within 24 hours received an email with a simple form to fill out for a new one.,67957,4
67957,The shipping took a few weeks but I was very happy to receive a free undamaged product!,67957,4
67958,I love the look and fit of these.,67958,4
67958,I wear a women's size 6.5 but for some reason the youth sized 5 Toms fit me better.,67958,4
67958,I would give these shoes 5 stars but for the lack of arch support which is typical of this brand.,67958,4
67959,They are super warm and comfy.,67959,4
67959,"I am 5'8 and bought a large and they were long enough, but they hang a bit funny at the crotch, I think because it is unisex.",67959,4
67959,Men of similar heights might want to buy an XL because they are not very wide either.,67959,4
67960,Great for my POPCORN halloween costume!,67960,4
67961,"The buckles had to be attached and I had to make holes in the overalls for the buttons, apparently the holes for where the buttons are were sewn shut.",67961,4
67961,For the sizing I'm a small in the U.S. so I took the advice and got 2 sizes up and got a large and it fits perfectly.,67961,4
67962,Bought these and the Muk n Luk.,67962,4
67962,These are a nice second to them.,67962,4
67962,A little bit wired in the toe area,67962,4
67963,I have small wrists and these fit a little snug so make note but I do like them,67963,4
67964,Came in a nice reusable bag.,67964,4
67964,"The color is gorgeous, more of a burgundy than red.",67964,4
67964,My Nexus 6p fits in the front pocket (had a clear spiegan case on it) AND on the inside.,67964,4
67964,"The purse feels lovely, as though it were expensive leather.",67964,4
67964,Will definitely order from them again.,67964,4
67965,Bottom was a bit small but overall all is great just didn't know bottom was open on the tail and took some trial and error to figure out how to put the top one,67965,4
67966,too short on length for my taste.,67966,4
67966,I try to find items that cover the hips,67966,4
67967,"its kind of tight but still cute, got a lot of compliments on this :)",67967,4
67969,"It is nice, but not exceptional.",67969,4
67969,It fits and is a nice weight and easy to clean.,67969,4
67970,Very had to find this color.,67970,4
67970,Beautiful shade of olive green.,67970,4
67970,Goes well with maxi skirts and slacks.,67970,4
67971,"They work REALLY well, but my child is an average size for his age and I found this to be a little small and awkward to put on.",67971,4
67971,"But it works, so that's all that matters!",67971,4
67972,Wore it in place of an ugly Xmas sweater and it was a big hit!,67972,4
67972,It does run big.,67972,4
67972,The small size will fit a 6-8.,67972,4
67973,"In the right lighting, it's basically see-thru.",67973,4
67973,But it's super cute either way,67973,4
67974,"it was great, but it sheds a lot.",67974,4
67975,Gorgeous dress but I'm having to exchange for a larger size because it s way too small.,67975,4
67975,I went by the measurements when ordering but couldn't zip it up when I got it home.,67975,4
67976,Fits good medium left plenty of sleeve room and fits to mid palm when I use the thumb holes.,67976,4
67976,It is very soft and comfortable.,67976,4
67977,nothing special but it works and seems to be made of quality material for the price.,67977,4
67977,if i paid $5 more i am not sure i would be very happy but at this price point i am happy i went with this over the cases listed at even cheaper prices.,67977,4
67978,I like these black shoes.,67978,4
67979,My husband has these exact boxer briefs.,67979,4
67979,He liked them so much i bought them for my boys.,67979,4
67979,They are great quality however they shrunk so much they no longer fit.,67979,4
67979,They only were able to wear 1 time.,67979,4
67979,Get them but order bigger size.,67979,4
67980,Fits well as expected needs to be washed a few time to get it a little softer,67980,4
67983,Cute as can be and gorgeous colors.,67983,4
67983,"Price is hard to beat, too.",67983,4
67983,"Top was a tiny big smaller than I expected, but not so much that it's uncomfortable.",67983,4
67983,This was a good buy.,67983,4
67984,"Its very cute, but the color is darker in person & its bigger then I expected.",67984,4
67984,Still a great buy for the price,67984,4
67985,They look good on my lady.,67985,4
67985,She worries she gonna kill herself wearing them.,67985,4
67985,Haha they look good on her though.,67985,4
67985,As most people have said they do have a strong smell out of the packaging.,67985,4
67986,Im a L/XL gal size 12/14 and they are tight.,67986,4
67986,But I like them all the same.,67986,4
67987,I wear them for Zumba and my heel slips on turns.,67987,4
67987,"A little annoying because I have to pay attention but they are so cute and comfy, it balances out.",67987,4
67988,I am 5'2 and prepregnancy was 130 lbs.,67988,4
67988,I ordered a size 12 and it was perfect.,67988,4
67988,A little snug up top in the arms but nothing uncomfortable.,67988,4
67988,Its a thin dress but seeing as it was needed in Florida durring warms months I am thankful for that!,67988,4
67988,Over all I love the dress and would order again!,67988,4
67989,Nice pjs for the price!,67989,4
67990,"I love it, it fits on perfectly.",67990,4
67990,It blends well with my other charms,67990,4
67991,The belt has a good length to it and will most likely need to be cut shorter.,67991,4
67991,Don't make it too tight as I can feel that the metal buckle may break if too much pressure is put on it.,67991,4
67991,So far I have had no problem with it and it works as it should.,67991,4
67993,Just what I was looking for for my college aged daughter.,67993,4
67994,Fits my son's head perfectly and he has a large head for his age group (10yr old).,67994,4
67994,It fits my husband a little snug and hats for adult males are usually a little big for him.,67994,4
67994,The Embroidery is as shown and good quality.,67994,4
67994,"I already washed it in the ""He"" washing machine in a garment bag.",67994,4
67995,"Bought this as a Christmas present, it fits her perfectly but she is very petite.",67995,4
67995,Seems to be good quality.,67995,4
67996,Only thing is that it doesn't close all the way.,67996,4
67997,A little shorter than I was expecting but a nice sweater with beautiful color.,67997,4
67998,I bought this product to protect my daughter's passport and I really like it.,67998,4
67998,"The mauve color is cute, the leather is soft to touch, and the passport fits in perfectly.",67998,4
67998,"It also has compartments to store your money, credit cards, etc.",67998,4
67998,I'm pleased with this item.,67998,4
67999,"Very cute, slits aren't as high as photos (given that the model is tall, I'm only 5'3"", and the slits start about 3"" above knees).",67999,4
67999,"Color as photo, soft material, but it had many loose threads off the package.",67999,4
67999,"Both (off shoulder) sleeves are supposed to be elasticized top and bottom, but mine on the left bottom side's elastic came broken.",67999,4
67999,I had to break the other side so it won't look wonky on.,67999,4
68000,I'm a 26 or usually a 4 or 6.,68000,4
68000,I ordered the large.,68000,4
68000,"I might have been able to get into a medium, but they'd be super skin tight.",68000,4
68000,These are VERY low-rise and short.,68000,4
68000,The quality seems ok with the exception of the zipper.,68000,4
68000,"Overall, worth the price.",68000,4
68001,It's super cute and handy.,68001,4
68001,"Like others have said, the card pockets aren't the best.",68001,4
68001,Some are a bit small and because of the rubbery leather material it is really hard to get the out.,68001,4
68001,On the other hand other ones are rather big and I don't feel comfortable putting most things in it.,68001,4
68001,Great for the price and I have no other complaints,68001,4
68002,I took off a star because they shrunk in the wash. And I'm a pretty petite person and they've become even too short for me.,68002,4
68002,But since I only wear them at home work out they're great.,68002,4
68002,Great moisture-wicking action and very comfortable.,68002,4
68003,"I loved the piece, but the arm area was to big.",68003,4
68003,Other than that everything was great.,68003,4
68004,"These were not ordered for myself, so I don't feel like I can respond to fit.",68004,4
68004,"May step daughter has not complained, so I assume the size fits good.",68004,4
68004,But this was after we ordered a second pair in a smaller size.,68004,4
68005,These were wonderful during my pregnancy and if I skipped a day wearing them I felt more tired and my legs looked worse too :( only complaint is that they were warm and so I sweat more in them.,68005,4
68005,If I wore them more than one day I would need to wash them bc they would slide down more than if they had just been washed.,68005,4
68005,"Also I am short but bc of my weight I ordered the size I needed, the belly fit well but the legs were so long I usually wore them to my toes",68005,4
68006,Watch is super well made and beautiful - as pictured.,68006,4
68006,It's a bit more large and clunky than it appeared though.,68006,4
68006,I have small wrists and it looked a bit ridiculous on me.,68006,4
68006,But it fits my husband quite a lot better.,68006,4
68006,Style works on any gender just a bit thick and wide for tiny arms.,68006,4
68007,It fits my (larger) medium body well.,68007,4
68007,"I'm 5'9"" and currently 195lbs.",68007,4
68007,The construction seems good; I'll know more after a few washes.,68007,4
68007,The design is very fun.,68007,4
68007,I like that it has the trap-door butt flap.,68007,4
68008,"they do not have 37W-31L, so I bought 38W-32L and tried to shrink.",68008,4
68008,still a bit large.,68008,4
68009,The 18 month old hat was WAY too small for my 12 month old.,68009,4
68009,He does have a big head though.,68009,4
68009,"Other than that, it was a cute hat!",68009,4
68009,Wish we could have used it!,68009,4
68011,"I wanted to try this because it was pretty and priced well even though it was a one size deal with the bust going to 39.3"".",68011,4
68011,I am a 42 but decided to give it a shot anyway because I could return.,68011,4
68011,However I was surprised it fit.,68011,4
68011,"Granted it is not loose like the model, but I can wear it.",68011,4
68011,Plus the quality of the material is very good.,68011,4
68011,Not flimsy at all.,68011,4
68011,Worth the great price I paid.,68011,4
68012,I'm giving this 4 stars because of how the breast area fits (it's loose in the band).,68012,4
68012,"For reference, I am 230lbs, 5'8"" and my hip size is about 50 inches or so.",68012,4
68012,The fit is very flattering for plus size women and I would def recommend.,68012,4
68012,The price point is very attractive as well,68012,4
68013,Well on a cloudy day this product helps keep my watch charged.,68013,4
68013,So I am satisfied...,68013,4
68013,Thank you for your service.,68013,4
68014,It fit my son a tiny bit too small.,68014,4
68014,He's 17 months and in the 2% for weight so he's already pretty small for his age.,68014,4
68014,I bought the 18-24 month size and one of the buttons came coming undone.,68014,4
68014,I'm giving it 4 stars because I liked the quality and he looked adorable in the outfit,68014,4
68015,I like the style and light weight.,68015,4
68016,Great for my son but had to get a 12 since he's growing,68016,4
68017,"A classic pair of shoes, I've been wearing the same style for 10 years now.",68017,4
68017,"I would say over the years, the quality seems to have declined ever so slightly while the price has gone up, but I suppose I still find them good enough to keep buying them.",68017,4
68019,My little boy loves them!,68019,4
68019,Little pricey for 3 pair though,68019,4
68020,Nice belt not Michael Kors but def.,68020,4
68021,The belt work great.,68021,4
68021,This is the dress belt.,68021,4
68021,"Nothing wrong with the belt, which is what I bought.",68021,4
68021,They included a Snap Belt loop with key ring.,68021,4
68021,The loop that I got won't stay snap.,68021,4
68021,I did not buy it for the key ring but just wanted to warn you about it.,68021,4
68022,Pretty and classy but runs a bit small!,68022,4
68022,Great to wear to the holiday party!,68022,4
68023,"I think the necklace is nice, however the chain is a bright gold which I don't really like that much.",68023,4
68024,"I do like the coat, but it is made very small.",68024,4
68024,May want to order a size or two up.,68024,4
68025,Fabric is very light.,68025,4
68025,Not forgiving for bumps.,68025,4
68026,"Fit fine, only dislike...bra pads aren't supportive!",68026,4
68027,I love love love this shirt!,68027,4
68027,But I think it should  be a little clearer for other potential buyers that the back is completely sheer.,68027,4
68027,This didn't bother me- but I was surprised at how sheer it was.,68027,4
68027,I recieve lots of compliments whenever I wear this shirt!,68027,4
68028,"Reminds me a little of the ""Atlas Shrugged"" movies.",68028,4
68029,"I am giving this only 4 stars because it's completely see through, but it's a nice piece of clothing for a nice price",68029,4
68030,"But I got the smallest size and it is still big on me, but will work as a cover-up.",68030,4
68031,"I love the dress, just a little big, but not a problem to fix",68031,4
68032,Run a little bit small,68032,4
68033,Sent them back to downsize by one half.,68033,4
68034,"This is a great, economical alternative for Triangl Bikini.",68034,4
68034,I got a medium and the bottom fits pretty well but the top could fit better.,68034,4
68034,I have to shorten the straps a lot to adjust the fit...,68034,4
68034,I'm normally size 4 or 26 in pants and 32C bra size just to give you review-readers a better idea.,68034,4
68035,this is my 3rd Henschel hat of this style.,68035,4
68035,I like the mesh for cooling and the wide brim.,68035,4
68035,The other hats seemed to have fit better.,68035,4
68035,The new one is  just a shade big on my head.,68035,4
68035,My wife has a medium which is too small for me.,68035,4
68036,Comes large and is really warm.,68036,4
68036,Overall a great costume!,68036,4
68037,Pretty but a little big!,68037,4
68039,My 16 year old loves Geasy!,68039,4
68040,"Comfortable, warm but a little hard to breathe through.",68040,4
68042,"I got this for my mom in XL and it is somewhat large in the stomach area, there just seems to be a lot of fabric, but notheing that can't be fixed.",68042,4
68042,She loves it and fixed it of course.,68042,4
68042,The details are beautiful and so far it resists machine washing.,68042,4
68043,"They are great, I wear them in my conch.",68043,4
68043,"The only problem I have is that the color does come off of some of them, but not all.",68043,4
68044,"I wish they made like a inch longer since I'm tall, but they go fantastic with a pair f chukkas or higher topped boots/shoes.",68044,4
68044,For 15 bucks the quality as absolutely insane.,68044,4
68044,Super soft to the touch.,68044,4
68044,"If you need a pair of pants that slightly tapers (not extreme) towards the bottom, buy these.",68044,4
68045,As advertised and came promptly.,68045,4
68046,smaller than I expected but my son loved it so I'm good!,68046,4
68048,"Bottoms fit perfectly, the top I had to shorten the straps a bit though.",68048,4
68048,But it was an easy fix and now I love wearing it out to the beach and pool,68048,4
68050,"I wish it would have come with a sturdy clip, but it's lovely",68050,4
68051,"In my opinion very cute, in my son's opinion, cool.",68051,4
68051,My only complaint is that my son finds it difficult to zip.,68051,4
68052,"very nice, but size too large.",68052,4
68052,I could not use,68052,4
68054,This is not your typical outfit.,68054,4
68054,Its comfy and super cute.,68054,4
68054,My baby received a lot of compliments,68054,4
68055,"Fit well, very comfortable.",68055,4
68055,"I would not describe these as ""skinny"" though.",68055,4
68055,More like a relaxed fit but I still like them.,68055,4
68055,"The company may not have sent the ""skinny fit"" though.",68055,4
68055,I didn't give five stars because the dye is still transferring to my hands after several washes and they are fading fast.,68055,4
68056,"I usually wear a small (I'm 5'3, 120 lbs) but I read reviews and ordered a medium.",68056,4
68056,"I'm really glad I did, as everything fits baggy (which is the style i was looking for) except the shirt was a bit snug on the hip area.",68056,4
68056,Stitched about an inch off the bottom and problem was fixed!,68056,4
68056,Order a size up from your regular!,68056,4
68057,Love the shirt but it did shrink a bit after the first wash.,68057,4
68057,I'd get it a size larger unless you flat dry it.,68057,4
68060,Great product for the money.,68060,4
68060,I love web belts and they are hare to find.,68060,4
68060,Very happy with product.,68060,4
68061,The dress is very thin and slinky.,68061,4
68061,I found the small to fit to fit as expected.,68061,4
68061,i really like it.,68061,4
68061,It will definitely need to wear a long tank or slip underneath since its see through.,68061,4
68062,"Love the design, light material and good for summer days and or nights.",68062,4
68063,material is a little thin but not see through,68063,4
68064,"This is nice, modest, yet trendy skirt my daughter really likes it.",68064,4
68065,I've gotten many compliments...fast shipping...smooth transaction!!,68065,4
68066,You don't get the picture you specify!,68066,4
68066,I wanted a deep blue nebula--would go with the clothes I planned to wear with it.,68066,4
68066,"I got the image of a galaxy: there's still enough color to make it fit the outfit, but now it's much less subtle of an image than I was wanting.",68066,4
68066,"I'll keep it, but I thought you all should know about that.",68066,4
68066,"Also, this is one of those products that ships directly from China, so the wait can be long.",68066,4
68066,"Finally, do pay attention to the image: the metal is a brass, or looks like brass.",68066,4
68066,"Fairly dull--would work well with steampunk inspired outfits, anything in the olive greens or old school camouflage colors.",68066,4
68066,The brass does make the blue color look even more vibrant.,68066,4
68066,"But if your outfits won't work with a brass colored chain, then don't get this.",68066,4
68068,I love my dress but the sleeves are kind of shorter other than that I love it just what I expected.,68068,4
68069,Wish the snaps weren't plastic.,68069,4
68069,Otherwise perfect and so adorable!,68069,4
68070,I would've wanted to know that the dress is see through.,68070,4
68070,Keeping it because it's beautiful just like in the picture...,68070,4
68070,"But need to wear something under, which takes away the fun for sunny days...",68070,4
68071,Bought this jacket as a gift for my Mom.,68071,4
68071,It's very nice looking and she likes it.,68071,4
68071,Because other reviews warned that the jacket runs small I ordered a larger size that I normally would.,68071,4
68071,So glad that I did.,68071,4
68071,It's fits my Mom just fine.,68071,4
68072,Pretty - gave me a callous tho,68072,4
68073,Runs just a little small.,68073,4
68074,Great rain and wind protection!!,68074,4
68074,My blue jacket looks beautiful.,68074,4
68074,Adds/retains some warmth on cold days.,68074,4
68074,"Made of very thin material, which does not seem to breathe very well (just be mindful of your layers and add/remove to combat sweat buildup).",68074,4
68074,You definitely need a layer between jacket and skin (like on forearms) or wetness forms quickly.,68074,4
68074,"I'm a bit worried about how long this will last (esp when hiking while wearing light backpack), although it's holding up great so far after about 10 hikes with no gear.",68074,4
68074,"Nice pockets, pretty convenient.",68074,4
68074,Very happy with hood and it's adjustability.,68074,4
68074,"I'd have ordered S if available, but the largish M offers space for a fleece and a down jacket underneath without compromising good looks (I'm 5'10"", 155, thin).",68074,4
68075,I ordered these in a 2T.,68075,4
68075,The shirt is adorable and very comfortable.,68075,4
68075,"The shorts are a little long, but still very comfortable.",68075,4
68075,The only reason I took one star off is that the shorts faded considerably after the first few washes.,68075,4
68075,"They are still holding up great, just wish the color had stayed longer.",68075,4
68076,Love the sweatshirt but I ordered too big of a size.,68076,4
68077,It does the job.,68077,4
68077,It is not very sturdy or flashy.,68077,4
68077,It will had a small amount of cards and a few bills.,68077,4
68077,For general day to day I don't know how it might hold up.,68077,4
68077,It will work for travle of short times.,68077,4
68077,The edges are sharp so be careful of not to rip your pant pocket or jacket pocket.,68077,4
68077,"I will say, for the price I do like it and will recomend.",68077,4
68077,It looks nice but it is basic build.,68077,4
68077,Nothing flashy about it.,68077,4
68078,I really love this necklace and you can't beat the price for what you get.,68078,4
68078,"I have several on different colors or varying styles that I bought and I am happy with them, they are more like costume jewelry though, so just remember you get what you pay for.",68078,4
68078,"That being said, they are great to wear out dancing or to concerts and stuff like that.",68078,4
68079,"A little pricy compared to other ones on this site but overall, a good glove.",68079,4
68080,My daughter wanted these for Christmas....,68080,4
68081,These are nice shorts but be sure to look at the waist sizing.,68081,4
68081,"I had to order an XXL for a 34"" waist.",68081,4
68081,Which is crazy but they fit fine.,68081,4
68082,The hot pink color is beautiful and the quality is great.,68082,4
68082,"I am 5'2, 120lbs and 32dd.",68082,4
68082,"I normally wear a large bikini top, but I went by the seller sizing chart and ordered a medium based on my measurements.",68082,4
68082,"The top has a sexy fit, which I love, and still holds everything in place.",68082,4
68082,"It has removable pads that provide a generous amount of ""push up"".",68082,4
68082,"I am giving 4 stars because the bikini bottom is a cut wide in the front, and I prefer a less conservative cut, especially with the sexy style of the top and scrunch butt.",68082,4
68082,"However, that is an easy fix for my tailor.",68082,4
68082,Overall I am happy with this purchase.,68082,4
68083,It fits a little snug in the thighs but i have thick thighs..,68083,4
68084,I didn't receive  the the turquoise silicone plugs but they feel great they fit very well and they came in very fast I cannot complain I love them!,68084,4
68084,Totally worth it !,68084,4
68085,For the price - GREAT!,68085,4
68086,I did see the change and I did give me a butt lift while holding in the stomach,68086,4
68087,"Very cute, good quality..",68087,4
68088,It is a little big.,68088,4
68088,The skeleton sits on the high end of the bump.,68088,4
68089,This is the perfect cheap dress that you can wear for any summer event.,68089,4
68089,I ordered a medium size and it fit me perfectly.,68089,4
68090,It's not what I was looking for,68090,4
68091,"Nice shirt, a little thin though",68091,4
68092,"Super cute, but lacking in quality.",68092,4
68092,The skirt started falling apart the moment I unpacked it.,68092,4
68092,The layers are reinforced with tiny plastic type wires that slide out.,68092,4
68092,The shirt bunched up around the embroidery after the first wash.,68092,4
68093,I bought my nephew a 2T in hopes that he would be able to grow into them.,68093,4
68093,He is 12 months old and they fit him perfectly.,68093,4
68093,If you buy them just make sure to buy them in a bigger size.,68093,4
68093,Other than that they are super cute and comfy.,68093,4
68094,Very nice ring but becareful it bends really easily.,68094,4
68095,"My daughter needed to dress with a Hawaiian shirt
It was a bit big but it works",68095,4
68096,it's smaller than I thought.,68096,4
68096,But it's good and seems sturdy enough not brake so easily.,68096,4
68096,If you're someone who has a habit of carrying more than they need anywhere I would definitely recommend it.,68096,4
68096,It has plenty of room of for things.,68096,4
68096,"Seems water proof, If you're planning on a trip to an amusement park but don't want carry a book-bag or a tiny purse for your souvenirs or other things I would recommend this.",68096,4
68096,"It's big enough for a few water bottles, your more, and other thing, and there's extra room for anything else you get while on your trip.",68096,4
68096,nice fast devielry / I would order from this company again the future.,68096,4
68098,Just what I ordered although I didn't know extra large would be so big,68098,4
68099,These socks are so cute!,68099,4
68099,"They are much too large now, but we will grow into them!",68099,4
68100,Very cute for the price and fits as expected.,68100,4
68101,I'm very happy with my order.,68101,4
68101,"I bought this for my boyfriends mom, as a late Mother's Day gift.",68101,4
68101,"The necklace It's simple, perfect and you can wear this with anything.",68101,4
68101,It didn't come with the boxs I put it in there.,68101,4
68101,I know my future mother-in-law is gonna love it!,68101,4
68103,Fits as expected but I do not like the material.,68103,4
68103,It is that itchy plastic.,68103,4
68103,Good value for the price though.,68103,4
68106,I now have a light blue belt,68106,4
68108,I like a lot this blouse,68108,4
68109,A little stiff but otherwise it's a good shirt.,68109,4
68110,Fit is really good.,68110,4
68110,Function is less than desirable.,68110,4
68110,The belt does not like to release.,68110,4
68110,It jams and hangs up.,68110,4
68110,It's looks are stellar.,68110,4
68111,I like this wallet.,68111,4
68111,It's a little stiff but it'll take time to break it in.,68111,4
68111,Plenty of room to hold all the important stuff.,68111,4
68112,This is a bit bigger than anticipated.,68112,4
68112,I can wear Sm/Med clothes.,68112,4
68112,I ordered a small and it definitely has extra room in it.,68112,4
68112,The sleeves are very sheer just like everyone says.,68112,4
68112,I do like the look of it and will be keeping it though.,68112,4
68113,I bought it for my 3 month old baby for a vacation to CA it was small and didn't use it.,68113,4
68114,Beautiful royal blue with silver buttons is stunning.,68114,4
68115,Fits good little baggy but overall I love this shirt,68115,4
68116,comfortable; not too long which is great because I am short; fit was perfect,68116,4
68117,This dress was perfect for what I needed it for.,68117,4
68117,"The fit was right on, perhaps even a tad bit on the big side.",68117,4
68117,I ordered the Champagne color and had cups sewn in as the lining is thin.,68117,4
68117,Very much worth the money.,68117,4
68119,"I liked the dress, however the picture is a little deceiving..",68119,4
68119,It has some tan in the Paisley pattern.,68119,4
68119,So if you are looking for Black and White only then I would say don't by this dress.,68119,4
68119,"I also am only 5'1"" and it was a perfect length.",68119,4
68119,It hung right at my feet.,68119,4
68119,I would say if you have a bigger belly and are taller then it probably won't fit you right.,68119,4
68121,These tops look pretty cute and fit well.,68121,4
68121,The material is pretty stretchy too.,68121,4
68121,Be careful with the white one tho!,68121,4
68121,I'm not a sweaty person but I got pit stains after a night of dancing...it bleached out pretty well tho,68121,4
68122,My daughters wear a 6 and 7 shoe in womens sizes and I bought them a medium.,68122,4
68122,A small may fit for the size 6 shoe if she wants something snug really snug.,68122,4
68122,"These seem to be fine, but they also seem a little flimsy.",68122,4
68122,"The stitching is fine, but they are made out of a thin mesh upper.",68122,4
68122,It's very thin compared to the sturdy neoprene-type dance paws that I've seen - so completely different.,68122,4
68122,I think the suede pads underneath could be a little bit larger - come closer to the toes.,68122,4
68122,My ballet-dancing daughter doesn't like them as much as her ballet shoes because she's used to having a large pad to turn on.,68122,4
68122,Remember that they are coming from far away and will take a couple of weeks to get here.,68122,4
68122,"Even with all that caution, they are about 1/4 of the prices of something like capezio's footundies.",68122,4
68122,They will work fine for something she only has to wear for an hour a week.,68122,4
68123,I don't wear much jewelry and I didn't mind having this on all day.,68123,4
68123,Makes having a hair tie on your wrist a lot more presentable.,68123,4
68124,"arrived on time, product is as promised",68124,4
68125,Love how this fits!,68125,4
68127,Love these they are so comfortable,68127,4
68128,Too many wages and it will tear.,68128,4
68128,Especially with agitator machine wash,68128,4
68129,"Very cute, I gave them 4 stars because they fit a little tight.",68129,4
68129,I wear a size 11 but ordered a 12 just to be sure and I'm so glad I did because the 12 fit perfect despite them being a little tight but I think once they are broken in they'll be fine.,68129,4
68129,"Over all I love these shoes, and they look just like the picture",68129,4
68130,The light could be more powerful.,68130,4
68130,It barely reached to the end of the sword but hey...it's still fun nonetheless!,68130,4
68131,Used this for an adult female costume.,68131,4
68131,Fit fine but believe it would be too large for a child.,68131,4
68132,"Sleeves are very long, otherwise fits good.",68132,4
68133,Quality of any shirt you would find in a department store.,68133,4
68134,I normally wear a U.S.,68134,4
68134,Misses 6 top and 4 pant.,68134,4
68134,This item in size XL fits perfectly and I am hoping there is very little shrinkage when washed/dried.,68134,4
68134,I have not yet washed/dried it but I will be surprised if there is not at least a small amount of shrinkage given the material it appears to be; there is no material content tag.,68134,4
68134,"At 5'3"", this item falls 1 inch above my knee in the front.",68134,4
68134,I bought both colors available and am glad I did.,68134,4
68135,Looks a lil diff then the pic but its still cute.,68135,4
68136,Have not worn this shirt yet - I did try it on it's a really cute shirt and will go great with jeans.,68136,4
68136,It is a little this which will require a cami underneath it.,68136,4
68137,Came exactly as shown,68137,4
68138,This ring is dainty and pretty.,68138,4
68138,"For the size of it, I'd say it feels heavy, which is nice.",68138,4
68138,"As other reviewers have stated, the color of the stone is a little disappointing, but overall I think it is a great value and I expect my daughter will love it!",68138,4
68139,My son loves his new shoes.,68139,4
68139,They fit him great.,68139,4
68139,Exactly what he measured in the store.,68139,4
68140,Adorable when on but I bought a medium for my daughter who usually wears a small and it was close to not fitting,68140,4
68142,they do not go up your thigh.,68142,4
68142,"im 5'6"" 198 pounds.",68142,4
68143,"Mid range quality, but snazzy design.",68143,4
68146,worked fine for a Halloween costume,68146,4
68147,"excellent product, I recommend it, it is good quality and it is observed that is orginal.",68147,4
68147,I loved it and I chock fine,68147,4
68148,My torso is long so it is often difficult to find one piece suits that fit me well.,68148,4
68148,"The top is a little bigger than I expected, but overall is a great suit with good coverage.",68148,4
68150,This sweater fits nicely but I have to take it to the cleaners to have 2 button holes made in it so I can button two of the buttons.,68150,4
68150,The seller/manufacturer missed two button holes.,68150,4
68150,So I will have to pay extra to have this done by my cleaners....it's just more convenient than to deal with returning it.,68150,4
68150,"I still gave it a four rating because it is very soft, stylish, and comfortable.",68150,4
68151,The shipping came earlier than expected and it fits great...love it!!!,68151,4
68152,I bought this for my best friend and she loves it ... but the shipping took a super long time.,68152,4
68153,I liked the design of the coat and how the patches were arranged on the jacket.,68153,4
68153,I thought maybe it could be a little heavy leather though but all in all I love the jacket.,68153,4
68154,This shirt is really stunning in person.,68154,4
68154,"My son wanted a bright Hawaiian shirt, so I bought him this one.",68154,4
68154,He is a big guy and at first the shirt fit great.,68154,4
68154,"A little roomy, but he likes them that way.",68154,4
68154,After I washed it though it didn't fit him as well.,68154,4
68154,It got wider and shorter.,68154,4
68154,I hung it to dry so I can't blame the dryer.,68154,4
68154,"He still likes it, but I don't love it as much.",68154,4
68155,"5'3 130, shows your curves and ripples but super cute.",68155,4
68155,Buy a size up if you've got love muffins or don't if your not self conscience.,68155,4
68155,I wore it with furry vest so muffin top issue solved!,68155,4
68156,"A little small, but they seem to work well.",68156,4
68157,I ordered a size large but I could have ordered a medium.,68157,4
68157,I'm not overweight but I have thick legs and hips with a booty and a little tummy fat.,68157,4
68157,I thought the model picture looked edited but I'm pretty sure any body type would look bangin with this bathing suit!,68157,4
68157,It hides any thick areas that you would want to hide and the material is very stretchy and soft.,68157,4
68157,Definitely not for swimming or yoga because the top would slide right off but it is super sexy and slimming.,68157,4
68157,Worth the purchase for the price and has a very good style and color variation!!,68157,4
68157,Trust me ladies you will look gorgeous,68157,4
68158,"It fits a little tight, but thats me and not the clothing.",68158,4
68159,I purchased this bag in preparation for a trip to a place where pickpocketing is common.,68159,4
68159,"Fortunately, I cannot review its ""anti-theft"" properties fully.",68159,4
68159,"However, I can say that this bag held everything I needed to carry with me on day trips from the place we were staying, and also it was great for air travel.",68159,4
68159,"The bag has a back pocket which is lined with an RFID-protective material, which also has a clasp to keep the zipper closed.",68159,4
68159,That pocket has smaller pockets for credit cards as well.,68159,4
68159,"I was able to fit four passports, as well as our printed travel plans (8.5"" x 11"") folded in half in that pocket.",68159,4
68159,"In the main compartment of the bag, I had enough room for two smaller journals, my phone, external phone battery and USB charging cable, business cards, an e-reader, pens, pencils, mints, and my Sony a-6000 interchangeable lens camera with the smaller lens attached.",68159,4
68159,"In the small pocket, I had an array of emergency medicine, earbuds, and lip moisturizer.",68159,4
68159,"With all of these things in the main pocket, I was still able to zip the purse closed when necessary and the additional clasp held the zipper in place.",68159,4
68159,"The two front pockets close by magnet, but are the perfect size to hold a Travelon RFID-blocking wallet.",68159,4
68159,"Because of the shape (the pocket is tapered at the top), it would be difficult to pick the wallet from the pocket, unless you're the one wearing the bag.",68159,4
68159,"I used the two side pockets to hold a few water bottles a lot of the time, as our destinations were quite warm.",68159,4
68159,"I like the wider bottom on this bag, and it is a quality I usually seek out in my purses/bags as I hate having the contents of my purse empty out on the floor when I am at a restaurant, a theater, or in my car.",68159,4
68159,"Most of the time when we were traveling, I wore the bag across my body, and the strap adjusted well enough that it fit comfortably.",68159,4
68159,Two things I don't like about this bag:  the nylon (?),68159,4
68159,"fabric is fairly slippery, and so wearing it on just one shoulder doesn't feel secure at all.",68159,4
68159,It wants to slip right off.,68159,4
68159,"Also, I thought it would be big enough to carry my oversized tablet in the main compartment with my other stuff, so I could use it as a purse and carry-on bag for the airplane, but it needs to be about 1"" taller for that.",68159,4
68159,"Despite those two little issues, I am very happy with this bag.",68159,4
68161,It isn't as soft as I expected but it fits great and is the perfect length.,68161,4
68162,I like this shirt.,68162,4
68162,"However, the material is not what I thought it would be.",68162,4
68162,It feels somewhat like what sporty attire is made of.,68162,4
68162,"However, the color is beautiful and I like it a lot.",68162,4
68162,"It is VERY hugging, so problem areas will be prominent in this shirt.",68162,4
68162,I got a size small and it fits like a small.,68162,4
68163,Fit is as expected.,68163,4
68163,Nice for a costume.,68163,4
68164,I've had my nose done for along time but haven't had any nose rings.,68164,4
68164,So when I saw this cute heart shape one I said why not start wearing a nose ring again.,68164,4
68164,"This set comes with 40 nose rings, is heart shaped and comes in purple, white, black, pink, clear, red, blue and green.",68164,4
68164,"The size is 2mm, 20 gage acrylic bone screw.",68164,4
68164,I got my order quickly and all the pieces are there.,68164,4
68164,Some are a bit longer than others but they are plastic so i can always file it down or cut them.,68164,4
68164,"They are very bright, the colors are great.",68164,4
68164,I have been wearing one everyday since I got them.,68164,4
68164,I've never had plastic nose rings before but they seem to be just as good as the metal ones.,68164,4
68164,They are super cute and I love them.,68164,4
68165,"Overall, I like the style but I could have uses a larger size.",68165,4
68165,I usually wear a small but the side vents on this top fall just at the top of my jeans so if I lift my arms I expose some skin.,68165,4
68165,I now wear a tank top under it for a little more coverage.,68165,4
68165,The next larger size may have eliminated this.,68165,4
68165,The style fits nice and the fabric is comfortable,68165,4
68166,Fun bracelet for the price.,68166,4
68166,Doesn't look cheap and seems to be well made.,68166,4
68167,Really good fit for the price,68167,4
68168,better looking in person,68168,4
68169,"Though I said this shirt fit as expected, I do find the sleeves a bit tight.",68169,4
68169,It's not much of a problem because it makes the shirt length look like it fits closer to the wrist and not hang over the heal of the Palm.,68169,4
68169,"However, the tightness around the wrist makes it hard to wear watches, something I where a lot.",68169,4
68169,The shirt looks good and feels good wearing it.,68169,4
68169,I actually got a compliment the first day wearing this shirt.,68169,4
68169,It has a modern yet 70's vibe which seems to be the preferred trend in fashion lately.,68169,4
68170,"I ordered this in red, size small.",68170,4
68170,It fits as shown in the photo and the color is a true red.,68170,4
68170,The material is good quality and you can't beat the price.,68170,4
68171,"I like it, but a little big around the mid section.",68171,4
68171,Very comfortable and well made.,68171,4
68171,"Definitely for big busted girls, like me.",68171,4
68172,Happy with the quality.,68172,4
68172,Heavy and cozy material.,68172,4
68172,"I'm currently 35 wks pregnant, 5'3, 38 i and a medium fit just fine.",68172,4
68173,Ordering a smaller size since the small was too large in shoulders and waist.,68173,4
68173,"Otherwise, I really liked the way it fit.",68173,4
68173,I normally wear a size 2.,68173,4
68174,They are great for protecting the bunion from rubbing on your shoe.,68174,4
68174,They are also very comfortable.,68174,4
68174,and they fit into your shoe with no problem.,68174,4
68175,Very cute bag but also disappointed I bought 2 bags and both straps broke.,68175,4
68175,"I wanted them so I could sling it around my neck which I did but the strap came apart on both bags o,n the first day Isued them now I'm stuck using the handles only.",68175,4
68176,"This dress had a little stretch to it so the material hugged my body very nicely, and the color was fantastic!",68176,4
68176,"I would highly recommend ordering a petticoat with this as well to help the dress flare out a bit, as it drooped to my sides without one.",68176,4
68177,It fits as expected.,68177,4
68177,My daughter loves it.,68177,4
68178,Comfortable but slightly small in the fit.,68178,4
68179,"Rad, exactly what I was looking for.",68179,4
68179,Covers the whole face.,68179,4
68180,I love how it looks but definitely try getting a size up at least because it fits too small,68180,4
68181,"Very Pretty, really Happy with my purchase.",68181,4
68182,Go up an extra size to get a perfect fit,68182,4
68183,The print looks very realistic.,68183,4
68183,My friends couldn't even tell I wasn't wearing jeans.,68183,4
68183,I love the high waist.,68183,4
68183,They do tend to slip down so I modified it and added elastics to the waist area.,68183,4
68184,I ordered the red vintage paisley.,68184,4
68184,I could have gotten away with one size smaller.,68184,4
68184,"It seems to run slightly big, but it's still nice.",68184,4
68184,The length is great for being short - it hits right at the top of my foot.,68184,4
68185,Only problem is one button fell off from the hood.,68185,4
68185,other then that it is great,68185,4
68186,"Thin material, but looked fine with a white tshirt underneath it.",68186,4
68186,Was expecting something a little more substantial I guess.,68186,4
68187,Love the style of this blouse.,68187,4
68187,However it arrived with holes in the back.,68187,4
68189,Comfortable and fits perfectly...,68189,4
68191,These are great for keeping babies warm I love them,68191,4
68192,"Comfortable, stays put and doesn't move around.",68192,4
68192,I play rugby in it and it is holding up just fine.,68192,4
68192,The color is exactly as pictured.,68192,4
68192,My teammates complemented me about it the second they saw it.,68192,4
68193,"This top washes and wears well and the brown was a good, usable color not easily found in stores.",68193,4
68193,"Wish I could find this one in black, navy and red.",68193,4
68194,Washed them in cold water and they shrank a little.,68194,4
68195,I am happy and will buy these again,68195,4
68196,This is not a dress; not a tunic either.,68196,4
68196,"However, it is a very nice top.",68196,4
68196,I normally wear a US Medium and normally order a Large on Asian made clothing.,68196,4
68196,Because of other reviews that said this come small and tight.,68196,4
68196,I ordered this in XL.,68196,4
68196,This is very roomy.,68196,4
68196,I've convinced myself that this style should be worn loose; not flowy.,68196,4
68196,There is no zipper nor buttons for openings.,68196,4
68196,You have to put it on over your head.,68196,4
68196,The neck area has ample opening.,68196,4
68197,looks good on jeans or skirt.,68197,4
68199,"Not the best fit for me, but a well made product.",68199,4
68200,Somewhat loose but hoping a few washing/drying s fixes that.,68200,4
68200,Otherwise love the shirt!,68200,4
68201,I really like these little booties.,68201,4
68201,I wanted something I could wear out to lounges and bars and this shoe does the trick.,68201,4
68201,"The heel height is nice--not too tall or too short, perfect for someone who is short like me and wants a bit of height.",68201,4
68201,The grippy sole on the front of the shoe is the reason I ended up buying it and I really like it.,68201,4
68201,"The first night I wore these it was wet and rainy, but with the rugged sole I was able to walk just fine without slipping or sliding.",68201,4
68201,"The arch doesn't hit quite right in my foot which is why I only gave 4 stars, but overall, it's a very nice boot for the price.",68201,4
68202,I love this too but the material is a bit thin.,68202,4
68203,"Good fit, Good feel...... thank you",68203,4
68204,"One scarf slightly snagged, was able to massage fibers back into place somewhat.",68204,4
68204,Thicker and heavier than other bamboo scarves I have purchased.,68204,4
68204,I'm more used to bamboo being a light airy fabric choice.,68204,4
68205,jus a bit confusing to find the front,68205,4
68206,Shipped a promise but runs VERY SMALL.,68206,4
68206,Order the next size up if you have any doubt.,68206,4
68206,The only problem was that the button hold was sewed in but never cut out for button.,68206,4
68206,It happens just going to exchange them.,68206,4
68207,I really like this product.,68207,4
68207,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it didn't fit my feet as it should (in my opinion).,68207,4
68207,"I realize they aren't supposed to be bulky, but they were small and it could be that I have just too wide a foot for this kind of sock, but I was hoping.",68207,4
68207,The product arrived on time and seems to be as described except for being small on me.,68207,4
68207,I had to really stretch them to get them on.,68207,4
68207,I wore them in a pair of bobs that I own and they were very soft just felt a little small on me.,68207,4
68207,Had to wear them all day before they had some give.,68207,4
68208,"First time I used this product, it was hard to get on.",68208,4
68208,"After using it twice, easier now",68208,4
68211,More of a crop top than anything I even ordered a size bigger than what I normally wear it's cute but very short and shows your stomach alot,68211,4
68212,"This swimsuit fits very well on me and gives me a little extra room, not too tight but not too loose either.",68212,4
68212,The only reason I'm not giving it a full five stars is because the string underneath the cup area was too low.,68212,4
68212,I did have to move it up as well as weave it through the top sides of the swimsuit a little to make sure everything stayed in place.,68212,4
68212,But overall it is a nice quality swimsuit.,68212,4
68213,"I ADORE the top of this swimsuit, but I will never ever wear the bottoms.",68213,4
68213,They are both incredibly revealing and way too small (my ribs are much narrower than my hips).,68213,4
68213,It is high quality material and entirely worth the price for just the top.,68213,4
68213,It's extremely cute and comfortable.,68213,4
68213,The thong bottoms are going in the trash.,68213,4
68213,I'll wear black bottoms instead!,68213,4
68214,I typically buy these at the farm store and pay more for them.,68214,4
68214,But found them on here and I can save between 5 and 10 dollars on them!,68214,4
68215,a little thin but they are dine,68215,4
68216,Fit as expected based on over reviews.,68216,4
68216,They are a little baggy around the thigh (and snug around the waist).,68216,4
68216,"I love that the entire garment, including the elastic is cotton (as far as I can tell).",68216,4
68216,The quality of the fabric is satisfactory.,68216,4
68216,My guy is 2.5 years old and they are just fitting his solid waist.,68216,4
68216,I consider my child to be on the hefty side of average.,68216,4
68216,The pee hole is a little small for practical use.,68216,4
68217,"It's good material and is soft, but I wished it came when it was suppose too.",68217,4
68218,Used for a stuffed bear dress- up.,68218,4
68220,Theses are great for little girls.,68220,4
68221,Went well with my NYC steam punk cosplay.,68221,4
68221,Its fun to hold down on the trigger and hear it play eagle sounds.,68221,4
68221,Feels like I'm summoning something (Persona 3 fans anyone?),68221,4
68221,Kinda difficult to tuck away on my waist bag (also steam punk themed) but it worked.,68221,4
68221,To change the battery slide out one of the sides to the handle.,68221,4
68221,When I got it i thought it was breaking or the battery was dying with no way of changing it.,68221,4
68221,My friend played with it for a while and we found out one of the batteries got loose.,68221,4
68222,shirt made a nice wall decoration but was too small,68222,4
68223,"Cute , I liked it.",68223,4
68224,I received it on time but there were two empty holes as if someone wanted 1 pair but not the others....,68224,4
68225,This tie was the perfect color however I miss read.. its SKINNY like maybe two inches skinny tie.,68225,4
68225,"I asked for a refund and I'd have to pay to send it back and for me, it just wasn't worth it.",68225,4
68225,Otherwise the tie seems decent quality for a few wears.,68225,4
68225,"It shipped very fast and the company was quick to respond, even if I lt didn't resolve my problem.",68225,4
68226,"Love the front and back, just the side is iffy.",68226,4
68227,there a little narrow..,68227,4
68228,not as pretty as the other ones I ordered,68228,4
68230,I've put them in my hiking boot because the ball and toe area was getting bent.,68230,4
68231,Surprisingly sturdy and strong.,68231,4
68231,Amazingly affordable considering they are polarized which is a huge perk.,68231,4
68231,For those who are not familiar with polarized lenses--phone screens will look weird--it is not the fault of the glasses--polarized lenses do this!,68231,4
68231,"As far as fit, I have a small face, so I wish they fit a bit better, but this is the case with all sunglasses I purchase.",68231,4
68232,Order your American size.,68232,4
68232,They make adjustments for maker.,68232,4
68232,I ordered 3 times based on reviews of being to way too small.,68232,4
68232,I finally order my true size SMALL and its is just so cute my adult daughters are going to be jealous  when they see it on me,68232,4
68233,cute cute runs small,68233,4

68235,"Great size, makes a dazzling statement.",68235,4
68235,A few Stones were not in place.,68235,4
68235,FYI It's impossible to crazy glue back in.,68235,4
68236,"I bought a large, thinking the fit would be similar to the Racerback Tank.",68236,4
68236,That's not the case at all.,68236,4
68236,It's much more fitted and a lot shorter in the length.,68236,4
68236,The quality of the cotton is outstanding.,68236,4
68236,"It seems to be well made, and it's more comfortable than most shirts I own.",68236,4
68236,The feel of the cotton is excellent.,68236,4
68236,I wouldn't hesitate to buy other colors.,68236,4
68238,I adore this set.. it is stunning and it got a lot of compliments!,68238,4
68238,"I wore it for as long as I could, which was about 5-6 months... by that time sadly the black medal faded to a dark silver & started to look very worn & beat up and some of the white stones fell out from the side of the band :(",68238,4
68239,This is a nice shirt.,68239,4
68239,I ordered a size up after looking at reviews.,68239,4
68239,"Have not washed it yet, so not sure how that's going to go.",68239,4
68239,"But overall, very awesome shirt for a great price!",68239,4
68239,I will be ordering different colors as well!,68239,4
68239,Just wish my favorite color(red) or black came in an extra large :(,68239,4
68240,"Esp love the shorts, although the matierial is kind of thin.",68240,4
68240,"Wish they had a lining across the chest, but I'd still wear this during the summer.",68240,4
68241,"Arrived in time, a little small but nice",68241,4
68242,Shirt us a beautiful color and as represented in the photo.,68242,4
68242,My only disappointment was that the tie was not a true necktie...it was an elastic band tie.,68242,4
68242,This was the only issue.,68242,4
68242,"I probably would not have ordered it had I known this, but despite this, I have to say that the quality is very nice and well made.",68242,4
68242,"Colors vibrand, hanky is nice and marches the tie well.",68242,4
68243,"It's not as ""slouchy"" as its made to look.",68243,4
68243,It fits more like a toboggan than anything else and I have short hair!,68243,4
68245,Ok little too small,68245,4
68246,They are what they are,68246,4
68247,"Not as heavy weight material as I expected, but they look good and fit well.",68247,4
68248,The bar that goes through the piercing is a bit long and shows.,68248,4
68248,"Other than that, they are great!",68248,4
68249,I bought size L because I read from some people in the review it ran small.,68249,4
68249,It fits great and usually I am size M,68249,4
68250,"These earrings are nice, exactly as pictured, however they are a little bigger than I expected.",68250,4
68250,"I bought them for my wife who has petit ears, they seem big on her, (She also normally wears studs).",68250,4
68251,Very cute great delivery,68251,4
68252,I wish it covered a little further down from my underboob.,68252,4
68252,But it worked for the concert i went too.,68252,4
68254,I loved this necklace !,68254,4
68254,It looks like the one pictured.,68254,4
68254,The only con is that a few of the beads had already fallen off.,68254,4
68254,It wasn't obvious and I will still be able to wear it proudly.,68254,4
68254,I have several Bohemian maxi dresses they will make a great extra to the outfits.,68254,4
68255,This is VERY comfortable and warm.,68255,4
68255,"It is not cheap at all, and is very fashionable (not bulky or too puffy).",68255,4
68255,It is a tiny bit small but not too small in my opinion.,68255,4

68257,I bought a medium.,68257,4
68257,"I'm a 34DD and the top was splurging a little bit is still wearable and not too PG-13, if you catch my drift.",68257,4
68257,"Is now my go to swim suit, but a bigger top wouldn't be a bad thing.",68257,4
68257,The bottoms fit great especially since they are adjustable.,68257,4
68257,I wish you could pick the sizes of the top that is different from the bottom because I would have done that.,68257,4
68257,I could have even gotten small bottoms and a large top if that was an option.,68257,4
68257,Still a good purchase and I'm not complaining too much just offering constructive criticism to the company.,68257,4
68258,the dress is super cute!,68258,4
68258,the material is really soft.,68258,4
68258,it fit me nicely around the shoulders & chest.,68258,4

68258,i am 5'8 and it hit my right above the knee.,68258,4

68262,It arrived within 2  days.,68262,4
68263,These are so cute but they do run small.,68263,4
68264,They are as described.,68264,4
68264,My boyfriend loved them.,68264,4
68264,They were a bit long but I expect that at 5'3.,68264,4
68265,I love the shirt..its well made..thou the fit across the chest is ehh.,68265,4
68265,The string goes right across the front not under the chest as shown in picture.,68265,4
68265,I think it is cut small unlike other people saying it big.,68265,4
68265,I ordered 2x I am a xl and it was still not good for well endowed me.,68265,4
68265,"It is beautiful, wish it fit better",68265,4
68267,Love it but it isn't as sheer and light weight as I thought it would be.,68267,4
68267,"Good winter scarf, won't work for spring or summer.",68267,4
68269,It fits as expected and it really comfortable to wear around.,68269,4
68269,The main downside is the back isn't as low as it's pictured.,68269,4
68270,I would buy this again.,68270,4
68270,"Sizing, at least in mine, was true.",68270,4
68271,The jeans fit perfectly and they arrived in a timely manner.,68271,4
68272,Works like a charm.,68272,4
68273,Not the best of material so it's alil smaller than expected but still very cute,68273,4
68274,"It fit my 17"" laptop, power cord and wireless mouse with a little room to spare.",68274,4
68274,Smells a little fumy when first received but that goes away within a couple days.,68274,4
68274,Its not very protective for accidentally banging my laptop against something when I'm carrying it but thats what I expected.,68274,4
68274,"I read other reviewers comment that they didn't like that the shoulder strap pad doesnt move, I actually really like that feature as it keeps it stable on my shoulder.",68274,4
68274,Overall very good bag and I would recommend it.,68274,4
68275,"They are awesome for the price, look good and feel good.",68275,4
68275,The only thing is they just feel like they will break easy but my intentions when buying these weren't for a long lasting pair.,68275,4
68275,But definitely great looking glasses for male and female,68275,4
68276,Because fit as expected!,68276,4
68277,Very nice piece of jewelry that came on time.,68277,4

68278,"I have a 32"" waist and the Medium size was WAY too small.",68278,4
68278,It fit like a compression short.,68278,4
68278,I'm going to return and re-order in large.,68278,4
68279,Nice bag to carry every thing!,68279,4
68279,It even comes with its on bag to keep it in.,68279,4
68280,"It shipped almost 2 monthes,but to be honest it's pretty and comfortable,4 stars",68280,4
68281,Like the ring thought it was well made but lost a stone today & I haven't wore it a lot--I did fotget to take it off when I had my hands in water so that may of been part of the problem.,68281,4
68282,Bought the 6 month size and our 3 month old was able to wear it.,68282,4
68282,For the price it is a good deal.,68282,4
68283,"excellent piece, but just see through enough that I wear a tight spaghetti strap top under it.",68283,4
68283,"Very hot design, washes well and dries sans wrinkles.",68283,4
68284,"The item does not look exactly like the first picture the model is wearing, but it does look like the other pictures.",68284,4
68284,"The material is what I expected, a light cotton material.",68284,4
68284,Most likely see through but I was planning on wearing my swimsuit underneath.,68284,4
68284,I suggest steaming or ironing the romper before wearing it out.,68284,4
68284,It will lay much nicer.,68284,4
68284,Overall it was true to size.,68284,4
68284,"I'm 110lbs 5'2"" 32C and purchased a small.",68284,4
68285,"Nice width and pattern, but would be even better if it were a matte finish and more flexible.",68285,4
68286,"I ordered the correct size, based upon earlier reviews which stated the sizes ran large.",68286,4
68286,"The shoulders were not as structured as I would have liked, but the robe is very comfortable.",68286,4
68287,"Bought it, and proceeded to lose it almost immediately, so I can't give a full review.",68287,4
68287,"I do remember really liking it and it fit my 17"" Macbook Pro..I'm just glad when it went missing, the laptop wasn't in it.",68287,4
68289,You can see straight through it,68289,4
68290,"Nice accessory - actually comfortable, and the price was very affordable.",68290,4
68290,"Found some nice red drop & silver earrings, and they match it very nicely - looks like they are a set.",68290,4
68291,"Product looks good, but the lenses are cheap looking.",68291,4
68292,Brought a large could of went for a medium I'm a double d.....not a nude as picture showed lil pink to me,68292,4
68293,wish poly was at 40% or more.,68293,4
68295,"Love the shirt, just didn't fit me well.",68295,4
68296,I love wearing these shades.,68296,4
68297,Is very cuality product only to big hard to use old day a work..,68297,4
68298,Not as soft as I expect a fleece gown to be on the inside of it.,68298,4
68298,But it does look nice.,68298,4
68299,"It's beautiful, functional, and sturdy!",68299,4
68299,Met all my requirements :),68299,4
68300,Shirts came on time and fit just right!,68300,4
68301,I was hoping it would be a bit higher quality.,68301,4
68301,"The metal is pretty cheap, doesn't fit the ammonite snugly, and some of the glue is showing in the back.",68301,4
68301,It does look very pretty though.,68301,4
68301,I purchased it as a gift and it was a big hit.,68301,4
68302,Look different in person than what's pictured.,68302,4
68303,Get loose after a while.,68303,4
68304,I love the product.,68304,4
68304,4/5 since there were minor stitching needed.,68304,4
68305,It's comfortable and warm.,68305,4
68305,Though I do have to resew the pocket on one side.,68305,4
68305,The tail is kinda poorly made.,68305,4
68305,It wouldn't even push through the fabric.,68305,4
68305,Suggestion: If you're going to use the bunny tail make sure the pin is strong enough to go through the lower band part..attaching it to the base material just rips it quicker.,68305,4
68306,They work just fine for my exercising purposes.,68306,4
68306,"In my pilates class I tried on a large...too big, then a small....too small.",68306,4
68306,"THey didn't have a medium but I was sure medium would be the perfect fit/ They are bit snug i the toe but since I'm walking in them, it shouldn't be a problem.",68306,4
68307,"These hiking pants were purchased for my 10 year old son, who wears a boys size 10-12 pant.",68307,4
68307,"These fit him fairly well, and he loves the fleece interior.",68307,4
68307,"These have a nice mid-heavy weight fabric, and zip side pockets.",68307,4
68307,"They're slightly long on him (he's about 52"" tall), and he has some room in the waist, but not enough to go down a size.",68307,4
68307,He wore these outside for about 8 hours on a 50 degree day; they kept him comfortably warm without being so heavy as to cause overheating.,68307,4
68307,"It rained some, too - these hiking pants kept him perfectly dry.",68307,4
68307,"These pants were washed with regular clothing, and put in the dryer by mistake (the label says not to tumble dry); they came out perfectly, and there was no shrinkage as a result of the tumble drying.",68307,4
68308,"It fits great and it is very comfortable, but the material does get a bit warm for the summer.",68308,4
68309,"Love this swim diaper, but I wish the snaps were on both sides instead of just one.",68309,4
68309,Runs a bit small and my daughter outgrew it quickly.,68309,4
68309,"But, these are so much better for the environment - and CUTER - than disposable swim diapers so we'll happily buy the next size up.",68309,4
68310,"I'm not too much of a review person, and was very skeptical about ordering a waist trainer just because I've heard bad things about them.",68310,4
68310,But this is simply amazing.,68310,4
68310,I'm usually a size Medium and after reading previous reviews I decided to buy a Large and it fits perfect!,68310,4
68310,A little hard to put on at first but super easier once you get the hang of it.,68310,4
68310,I started off in the loosest hook and in just 2 weeks I am on the last (tightest) hook and ready do buy a smaller size.,68310,4
68310,Ordered my new one!!,68310,4
68310,I didn't give this 5 stars just because once you have it on for about 2-3 hours starts to become uncomfortable when sitting.,68310,4
68310,Which is why I've only worn it at the gym which is every day.,68310,4
68311,This cardigan fits true to size for me.,68311,4
68311,"I am 5'6"", 220 pounds.",68311,4
68311,I ordered a 2x.,68311,4
68311,The front flows nicely.,68311,4
68311,"The back comes just below my hip line, but doesn't cover the bottom.",68311,4
68311,That's fine with me.,68311,4
68311,The front is longer because of the draping in front.,68311,4
68311,"My only complaint is I wish it was as light and as pastel as the photo, but it is fairly bright in color like a bright peach color.",68311,4
68311,That's why only four stars.,68311,4
68311,"The quality of the material is average and seems to be consistent with most clothing now a days, a bit thinner material.",68311,4
68312,The print is vibrant like a photograph .,68312,4
68312,It is a bit small in the top but generous in the skirt.,68312,4
68312,I have an enormous chest though.,68312,4
68312,"The skirt is transparent, but nothing a slip can't conceal.",68312,4
68312,The top portion is double up fabric so it's opaque.,68312,4
68312,I'm glad I ordered a size too big I would have had to return it otherwise.,68312,4
68312,Overall I'm very satisfied and would buy this for other people as a gift.,68312,4
68313,"the dress is beautiful, looks exactly like in the picture but it is too tight.",68313,4
68313,"for a reference, i'm 5'2'', 36-28-36 and a Medium is skin tight.",68313,4
68313,the length is about an inch above my knees.,68313,4
68313,I will be returning and will get the Large.,68313,4
68313,"It is also sheer, so i might need a white tank dress under it.",68313,4
68315,by far my favorite choker cute for the summer,68315,4
68316,Totally cute and well made but did not fit my toddler's head (and it's not even that big),68316,4
68317,"Great for Christmas, the fit is a little large, you have to be a little conservative on your movement, being that there are many wires underneath that can come apart from the bulb.",68317,4
68319,I received these bottoms THE VERY NEXT DAY with standard shipping!,68319,4
68319,"I'm only giving 4 stars because after reading the comments, I was somewhat under the impression that I should order a size down.",68319,4
68319,"I'm a 12, ordered a 10, needed a 14...",68319,4
68319,"I wish I could just exchange for the right size, but I'm only given the option to refund.",68319,4
68319,"Other than that, A+ material & great coverage!",68319,4
68320,"I'm 5'4, 130 lbs and when I got the dress in the mail I was a little disappointed because it was a little long/big on me.",68320,4
68320,I got a medium after reading the comments.,68320,4
68320,I ran it through the washer and dryer to see if shrinking it a bit would work and it did!,68320,4
68320,It's the perfect length now.,68320,4
68320,I recommend buying a size up and washing/drying if you need to.,68320,4
68320,"There was also a pretty big hole on the ride side seam, but overall happy with the dress.",68320,4
68322,It was a little smaller than the one I replaced and I would have liked it to be a little bigger.,68322,4
68322,Fit and finish is great.,68322,4
68322,I'm happy with it.,68322,4
68322,"I don't carry a separate wallet, so it has function for cards, license, etc.",68322,4
68322,It is adequate for my needs.,68322,4
68322,I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a nice looking option for their cards.,68322,4
68322,I'd recommend it 4 to 4.5.,68322,4
68322,If it were a little bigger it would be a 5.,68322,4
68323,"Had to replace O-rings, they kept coming apart.",68323,4
68324,A littler longer than I thought.,68324,4
68325,"I am 5'3 and 138lb, 36C and I ordered the XL.",68325,4
68325,The top fits okay- it's a little too big around (because of the back clasp it's not adjustable) and the cups are almost too small (probably because there is a LOT of padding) but it's still workable.,68325,4
68325,The  bottoms fit perfectly.,68325,4
68325,"The color of the flowers are much brighter than pictured, think neon orange, rather than the more muted color it looks like it would be.",68325,4
68325,Even my own pictures don't do the color justice.,68325,4
68325,"It's okay, just not what I expected.",68325,4
68327,"The purse is very quality but its not the big size tote, i was expected to be.",68327,4
68327,Keep it in mind,68327,4
68328,"Cute, but the lace is rather long and one sock had a small hole in it (but was easily fixed).",68328,4
68328,"Looks kind of gaudy but with the shoes I was wearing with it, it was appropriate.",68328,4
68329,Nice watch smaller then expected but ok the lid recole spring broke but was easy to fix,68329,4
68330,"decent wallet, well made, but a bit smaller than I truly need.",68330,4
68330,great for the minimalist tho!,68330,4
68331,Love the fleece lining.,68331,4
68331,The sizing is hard to predict: ordered 1 size up than my sizing of Medium but the Large was somewhat snug but I believe the XL would be way too big.,68331,4
68332,"The colour is a rich red brown, darker then the photo but well described in the product description, I found the colour didn't match my shoes so that was disappointing.",68332,4
68332,"I am a 34 "" waist, I ordered a 34"" and it fitted well with two holes to spare for blow outs.",68332,4
68332,"It is a man belt and I like it, I figure I might not have a pair of shoes that work with it now but one day I will and until then I""ll dream of he day I can wear my man belt the way it was intended..... with knee high cowboy boots?",68332,4
68333,"Its cute, but there isn't any underwire for support.",68333,4
68333,You'll need to fill the top completely in order for the two top lines to pop on your cleavage.,68333,4
68333,"If not , than, it's pretty loose at the top without any way of adjusting.",68333,4
68334,I thought it was a little bigger,68334,4
68335,Looked just like the picture.,68335,4
68335,Fits somewhat small in the chest.,68335,4
68336,Bought this for my gf she loved it.,68336,4
68336,A little snug but overall happy with the purchase.,68336,4
68337,I ordered the gold gloves for a costume.,68337,4
68337,They fit nice and look good.,68337,4
68337,They are fun to wear.,68337,4
68338,They are great and cuddly warm.,68338,4
68338,I ordered 2T thinking my son would use them later this winter but they fit just right right now.,68338,4
68339,No tears or loose strings.,68339,4
68339,Same expectations as other Vans shoes.,68339,4
68339,"Really liked the checkered design, matched nicely with black jeans.",68339,4
68339,Package arrived in a timely matter and had no damage/flaws to the shoe.,68339,4
68340,Its comfy nd nice but a lil baggy,68340,4
68341,"Great hat  if you want something a little big, that doesn't fold at the brim either.",68341,4
68342,"I've had past disappointing experiences with buying swim suits from Amazon (mostly because I didn't read reviews or there weren't any to begin with), and this one is a total game changer.",68342,4
68342,Of course I learned from my mistakes and read the reviews (more times than I'd like to admit) before buying this suit for its cheap price.,68342,4
68342,"When I read the reviews I saw many people advise to order two sizes up, I was a little skeptical and a little nervous to order a large since I'm a size small.",68342,4
68342,"So instead I got a medium, it fits pretty fine except for the boob area.",68342,4
68342,"I'm 5'2"" with 34A cups.",68342,4
68342,"The only problem I had was the boobs, and it's not even that big of a problem.",68342,4
68342,It's just a little too narrow and if I move a great deal I'll probably suffer from a nip slip.,68342,4
68342,"However if you're a pretty lean build, short as in like 5'3"" and shorter, and naturally a small/xsmall with smaller breasts, medium will be perfect for you.",68342,4
68342,"Also the material is amazing, I'm no expert but as a competitive swimmer it feels like any other practice suit material.",68342,4
68344,These would have been great of it weren't for my bunion.,68344,4
68344,Sadly they just didn't work out for me.,68344,4
68346,Looks very nice for the price.,68346,4
68347,They stretch quite a bit throughout the day.,68347,4
68348,"I loved this necklace, I wore it everyday, but it started to get a bit faded on the side that touched my skin after a while.",68348,4
68348,I still really like it and would purchase again if it was still $10 as it was when I originally bought it.,68348,4
68348,I received a lot of compliments on the necklace.,68348,4
68349,Not cheap at all.,68349,4
68349,"But not as pink as the picture shows, in my opinion.",68349,4
68350,Great fit for a while but tends to shrink about a size after a couple of washes,68350,4
68351,love the pants but the dye comes off on your hands,68351,4
68352,"Not sure huw long stitching will last on Velcro fit side adjustment, already lifting before I tried it in.",68352,4
68353,"For the price, these rings were what I expected.",68353,4
68353,The only issue I have is that one broke in half just by me sliding it on my finger as soon as I took it out if the package.,68353,4
68353,It's almost like they're made out of plastic!,68353,4
68353,For the price though that's about what I would expect.,68353,4
68353,"Quality aside, they're SUPER cute and I'm looking forward to wearing them during my trip to the Bahamas!",68353,4
68354,"Cute top, flattering and comfortable.",68354,4
68354,I wish the neckline was a finished seam rather than an unfinished fold-in because it takes some doing to get the neckline to lay right/look right.,68354,4
68355,Shipping was much faster than expected!,68355,4
68355,"The outfit is adorable, the M/L fits my 34F perfect, and I'm able to take it in around my waist.",68355,4
68355,"It does have this piece of elastic that goes across the mid back, that fits awkward.",68355,4
68355,"skirt is very full, so I trimed the top layer of tool to slim it down some.",68355,4
68355,"The hat is stuffed with cotton and has a large metal clip that has to be held in place with a bobby pen (with all the stuffing it flops around) there is no gold belt buckle on the belt, which is disappointing.",68355,4
68355,And the tights fit as expected.,68355,4
68356,"I am 5'8, almost 200lbs.",68356,4
68356,38D and a firm size 16.,68356,4
68356,I have a long waist.,68356,4
68356,The 16/18 fits perfectly.,68356,4
68356,The suit has good structure and real underwire and padding which provides great support.,68356,4
68356,"I wouldn't do jumping jacks (well, maybe if I tied the top very firmly and I went slow...) but for schlepping along after my kid should be fine.",68356,4
68356,The rest of the suit is not lined and does not have any sort of tummy or tush panel.,68356,4
68356,I chose this because I am tired of the extra fabric on the skirted ones taking so long to dry.,68356,4
68356,I'm pleased with it even if it didn't magically drop 20lbs for me.,68356,4
68357,"As others have commented, darker silver than pictured.",68357,4
68357,Does not scratch easily.,68357,4
68358,"A little long, but fits well everywhere else.",68358,4
68359,The costume arrived quickly and well packaged.,68359,4
68359,"It fits somewhat large on me, but that shouldn't deter a potential purchaser because I have difficulty finding clothing regularly, plus after I put the apron on and tied it, it fit much better and looked less bulky on me (the apron, by the way, is a little confusing at first because it's a crisscross design, but after I got it, I got it).",68359,4
68359,"I love the the slip under the dress, it's simple but has a floral hem which adds a nice subtle touch to the costume.",68359,4
68359,"The quality itself is a bit better than Halloween costume material--breathable and kind of thin, but it works perfectly for a nice little cosplay that won't break the bank and still be cute and recognizable.",68359,4
68359,I can't wait to wear it for Halloween!,68359,4
68360,It's smaller than described--definitely not long enough to be used as a wrap.,68360,4
68360,"Beautiful, and I plan to use it as a veil, but would have liked it as a shawl/wrap.",68360,4
68361,Wish it were a smidge longer.,68361,4
68362,"It works, it's cheap, it hasn't fallen apart, but I expected it to be thinner.",68362,4
68362,My friends' eel skin wallets are much thinner than this.,68362,4
68363,Just a little long,68363,4
68364,Don't go by the size chart..,68364,4
68364,Goes one or two sizes below your nature waiste..,68364,4
68364,This product is good but after a day it leaves like a burning sensation in your skin.,68364,4
68364,I guess I just need to get use to it.,68364,4
68365,Easy to fix and i like the variety of colors available to match my attire.,68365,4
68367,"love my shirt, i wear it all the time, the fit is really nice and the cat is starting to peel off a little but its still pretty awesome",68367,4
68368,Love the range of color!,68368,4
68369,I love this dress it fit as expected.,68369,4
68370,Very nice and pretty.,68370,4
68370,I bought 3 more sets.,68370,4
68370,"Red, Burgundy & Navy blue.",68370,4
68371,Had to send back slightly small for my liking.,68371,4
68373,perfect for our crow costume,68373,4
68374,"Husband liked black, I, the red.",68374,4
68375,Fits perfectly except I think it is a little baggy in the front.,68375,4
68375,Not sure I like the way it gathers when the drawstring pulls together.,68375,4
68375,I think I may actually have to go a size smaller in these pants.,68375,4
68376,It's a good government like the butt lift comfortable,68376,4
68377,Not my favorite material.,68377,4
68377,But it's really cute can't wait to wear it.,68377,4
68378,Fits small but as you've read in the reviews you have to order up a size or two.,68378,4
68378,I am normally a medium and got the LG to be sure they fit properly.,68378,4
68378,VERY WARM on the mountain under my ski pants.,68378,4
68379,"The waist region is made for women with really long torsos, but otherwise it's just fine.",68379,4
68380,Big jump from size 5 to 6 but they are super cute and stay on well.,68380,4
68381,10 year old picked it out and it fit perfect.,68381,4
68381,Love the coral color.,68381,4
68382,I'm fairly satisfied with my purchase of this top.,68382,4
68382,The product arrived on time and nicely packaged.,68382,4
68382,"The plastic wrap that this was in was like that of a big Ziploc bag, with the sealing zipper at the top - I thought that was pretty nice.",68382,4
68382,I tried on this top and the sleeve length is a bit too long for my arms.,68382,4
68382,"If I left the sleeves untouched, they would fall past my hands.",68382,4
68382,"However the top fit me very nicely, a bit tight at the armpits but that's just me being too knit picky.",68382,4
68382,I hand washed the shirt and let it surf dry overnight.,68382,4
68382,"I noticed that while I was rinsing and squeezing water out of the shirt a tint of red water came out as well, so I would be a bit careful if you were to machine wash it with other clothes.",68382,4
68382,"The shirt did not come laced up, I had to lace the string through myself which wasn't really a big deal.",68382,4
68382,"However I think the open top part, like the breast area, was a bit loose on me.",68382,4
68382,"It might have been because I didn't tie/lace the shirt properly before trying it on, but when I went to the sink to wash my hands I had to bend a little and the chest area flap was completely loose, showing visible cleavage.",68382,4
68382,"But overall, this is a pretty good top to have.",68382,4
68382,It was not sheer at all and the fabric is better than I thought it would be.,68382,4
68382,I would recommend getting this top.,68382,4
68382,"I got this in a size medium, for reference I'm 5'1"", 34 B, and around 111 lbs.",68382,4
68384,Great looking light saber.,68384,4
68384,"The latch broke pretty easily and the switch sometimes is not easy to find, but for the price, this is the perfect playtime kylo ren saber.",68384,4
68384,The side pieces do NOT light up.,68384,4
68384,"The end extends out and you can lock the sword in the closed position (but be careful as that piece can break easily)

Pros:
Looks good, nice detail
Lights up
Cheap

Cons:
Flimsy locking piece
On/Off Switch hard to see
Side Pieces do not light up",68384,4
68388,I love this bracelet!,68388,4
68388,I got some for my bridesmaids and myself.,68388,4
68388,"It's delicate, but not to where you're afraid it'll break and you have to stretch it to get it on, but it's as beautiful as the picture.",68388,4
68389,"I had to take in the shorts a little, but it was really cute.",68389,4
68389,I got a lot of compliments!,68389,4
68391,"They are cute and have survived 2 washings and 3 months of very active wear, so far!",68391,4
68391,His last pair of Etnies fell apart by this time.,68391,4
68392,I really like this dress.,68392,4
68392,Not only is it sexy but I received compliments all night at my office Christmas party.,68392,4
68392,I'm only rating it 4 stars instead of 5 because the back of the dress was a little gappy  (not a word but it works for this situation) and the inside slip kept riding up.,68392,4
68392,Otherwise I'm keeping it and i'll definitely wear it again.,68392,4
68395,I love the style - just a little smaller in the bust area than I had expected.,68395,4
68396,loved it...other than shipping being late,68396,4
68398,I really like it and knew they ran small so I bought a size up.,68398,4
68398,"I'm 5'8, 230lbs, sizes 16/18.",68398,4
68398,I bought a 2XL which fit perfect.,68398,4
68398,Comfortable and looks nice.,68398,4
68398,"It is a bit see-through, so I wear nude underthings with it.",68398,4
68399,I already own the black model of this swimsuit.,68399,4
68399,This green colour although the same Large size is a more relaxed fit.,68399,4
68399,I'm normally a Medium but sized up which fits perfectly.,68399,4
68399,I took one star off because it seems not as well made as my black one.,68399,4
68400,Saw this and fell in love when It arrived.,68400,4
68400,I was expecting it to be tiny but it's super spacious.,68400,4
68400,I like crossbody  bags so I took the handles off and it looks awesome.,68400,4
68400,The only reason I gave it a four is because the strap broke like within the first week.,68400,4
68400,But I used a key ring and it's not noticeable.,68400,4
68400,Other than that if you like big cute bags this is definitely a yes!,68400,4
68401,my son loves these!,68401,4
68401,He's a small six and they fit fairly well.,68401,4
68402,This product works pretty well for skiing.,68402,4
68402,It is nice that you can adjust the size.,68402,4
68402,My 10 year old son wears it and it works good enough.,68402,4
68402,I wouldn't try it for anyone smaller.,68402,4
68402,He should be able to grow in to this for several years.,68402,4
68403,The only flaw is the rubber stopper backs.,68403,4
68403,They seem to slide a little but over all these are beautiful.,68403,4
68403,I got them in a size 6g.,68403,4
68404,I tried a couple other dresses from China.,68404,4
68404,The sizing was totally confusing and I went by their measurement chart and ordered larger.,68404,4
68404,This was not thru Amazon.,68404,4
68404,When they arrived I was very disappointed because they didn't even begin to fit.,68404,4
68404,"I later ordered this dress thru Amazon, and the size was true to their description.",68404,4
68404,It fits nice and is roomy enough even after washing.,68404,4
68405,So I read the reviews and ordered an XL because I'm 5'6 220lbs but small waist(36) However it was still too big.,68405,4
68405,The top as bottom are stretchy so a smaller size would probably hold better and not be saggy.,68405,4
68405,It did arrive before expected and color and pattern were exactly what was pictured.,68405,4
68405,I will return for smaller size.,68405,4
68407,"It is just the kind of ear-rings to lively up your ""little black dress""!",68407,4
68408,My children are on the extremely small side of the spectrum so this fits pretty big on my 1 year old.,68408,4
68408,The only reason it is getting the 4 star is because  it is listed as an infant and toddler fit.,68408,4
68408,"Beyond that, we love the design and it has the potential to be a 5 star when he finally fits in it!",68408,4
68409,"Shoes are great and beautiful but if you have wide feet,  its not the shoes for you.",68409,4
68409,Will have to buy shoe stretchers to stretch it out a bit...,68409,4
68410,I like the lighter color,68410,4
68412,The vest is beautiful; however the care instructions are confusing.,68412,4
68412,"The first instruction says ""cold water wash"" then right underneath, it says, ""dry clean only.""",68412,4
68413,"The hats are fine came as expected, by great condition.",68413,4
68413,I would just say be sure they're compatible for ur needs.,68413,4
68413,"For instance, they look great with my twists but not necessarily with a lot of my Natural styles.",68413,4
68413,"I guess what I'm trying to say is I use hats for bad hair  and this one isn't really for that, unless I'm doing something wrong.",68413,4
68413,I'll admit I'm just finding my way with styling as a new natural.,68413,4
68414,"They are more like tights than leggings, but for what I wanted them for will still work.",68414,4
68415,Its nice more flat/thin than it appears.in the picture,68415,4
68416,"Fits true to size, if your arms are large it may be too tight on the arms.",68416,4
68416,"I'm 5'6"" 200lbs size L in shirts.",68416,4
68416,I'm super satisfied with this!,68416,4
68416,A well $8 spent!,68416,4
68416,"Has some frayed seems, but nothing scissors won't fix...",68416,4
68416,I definitely wouldn't spend the original $39 it says it was...,68416,4
68416,But I'll be ordering more for sure!,68416,4
68417,Bought as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.,68417,4
68418,A group of ladies and I wore this to a Grease Party!,68418,4
68419,Print just as pictured.,68419,4
68419,Order a couple size up for comfort fit.,68419,4
68422,"I'm 5'5 130lb, 34 B and this just fits me.",68422,4
68422,"It hasn't got much stretch to it, so its a bit of a struggle to get it on.",68422,4
68422,"Its quite flattering, but will not serve as a bra on its own unless you plan to be very still or have a smaller bust line.",68422,4
68422,I wear mine over a push up bra.,68422,4
68422,"It won't completely cover the cups, but it adds a nice touch.",68422,4
68422,It also adds some coverage below the bras so I can wear transparent tops and side sleeve tanks without feeling exposed.,68422,4
68422,"That was my plan for this top when I ordered it, so I suppose we have a win!",68422,4
68423,"Fits well, except large in the waist.",68423,4
68423,Would be perfect with adjustable waistband.,68423,4
68423,Size child extra large seems comparable to size 8.,68423,4
68425,Exactly the way I wanted it to fit!,68425,4
68427,My zipper on the smaller side likes to get stuck all the time.,68427,4
68427,It works perfect besides that little thing.,68427,4
68428,Very comfortable and love the stretch quality.,68428,4
68428,Looking forward to wearing them often for yoga and other exercise.,68428,4
68429,"Love this dress, it is slightly see through but onc its on you really can't tell.",68429,4
68429,It would have 5 stars but the top fits funny and will have to be altered to wear.,68429,4
68429,A great fit for curvy girls though and perfect shimmer to it.,68429,4
68430,"It's nice but still,  I will love to have a smaller size,  especially the suit.",68430,4
68431,This pack of socks worked out so well for my fiance's groomsmen.,68431,4
68431,"They are wearing the socks on our wedding day, and the socks arrived with no problems and quicker than expected.",68431,4
68431,"The only downfall is the Batman is not the typical color, so it takes a little bit to figure out.",68431,4
68431,"Besides that, all worked great.",68431,4
68432,These look a bit on the cheap side but they're great for the price.,68432,4
68435,"Wow, where to begin.......it fits wonderfully and is delightfully affordable, as compared to several mall stores---however, my one complaint is not on the tunic itself, but the ""tracking"" listing.",68435,4
68435,It won't tell you when it is arriving or anything of that nature.,68435,4
68435,I was lucky that it arrived before we left town for a vacation.,68435,4
68435,"Other than that, fits well.",68435,4
68436,"This skirt, while not unattractive, was both too small and too ""young"" for its intended recipient (who is very slim).",68436,4
68436,"The sizing was apparently Asian, which tends to run between one and two sizes smaller than Western.",68436,4
68436,"Even if it had fit, the high waist was too form-fitting for a middle-aged woman, although it would have looked good on someone in her twenties.",68436,4
68437,Found them to be a bit smaller than expected.,68437,4
68437,Especially after the wife washed them and put them in the dryer.,68437,4
68437,Don't need a belt for them now!,68437,4
68437,Probably purchase another pair but one size up to allow for additional craft beer consumption.,68437,4
68438,Very cute nice for the price,68438,4
68439,"I love it, but had to return it...a bit too small.",68439,4
68440,very cool I like it a lot as expected,68440,4

68442,She is going on and on about it.,68442,4
68444,I think it is going to be a hit.,68444,4
68445,Beautiful and the fabric it is awesome,68445,4
68446,Bit large but it's cute,68446,4
68447,Not the best fabric but its good for the price,68447,4
68448,"So cute, fits perfect, love the color.",68448,4
68448,But I wish they had pink in it instead of gold.,68448,4
68449,Solid Seiko time piece.,68449,4
68449,I'm never disappointed with Seiko.,68449,4
68449,"Band seemed a bit light, but overall watch Is height quality.",68449,4
68450,"I a nice necklace but inside doesn't glow, but I like it.",68450,4
68451,My 1st experience with this purchase was not a pleasant one.,68451,4
68451,"Nonetheless, I reordered the product with extremely low expectations.",68451,4
68451,I did receive the product within the 2-day window.,68451,4
68451,All of the items (including the sunglasses) were within the package.,68451,4
68451,"The product was carefully and elegantly wrapped, the case is a soft cover, all very nice.",68451,4
68451,The reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because I was under the impression that lens were completely mirror with the color scheme light pink on darker pink based on the imagery under its description.,68451,4
68451,"However, its actually a matte rose gold frame with partially matte lens with a horizontal pink mirror section in the center of the lens.",68451,4
68451,"They are cute, wearable, but not what I was expecting.",68451,4
68451,"I had ordered another pair in a different color with my original order, which are taking longer to arrive, but at least now, I know exactly what I will be receiving.",68451,4
68454,I like and it's comfortable.,68454,4
68455,"Nice, thin socks with cool design.",68455,4
68455,Fits a bit small.,68455,4
68456,s6+ fits in fine..but if your phone should so happen to fall on the face.. it will not protect it..but the selfie lighting is awesome,68456,4
68457,gave it as a gift was very much appreciated fitted perfect,68457,4
68458,It was really short,68458,4
68459,These hold your package like your wife does when she's excited.,68459,4
68460,Giving it four stars simply because it didn't fit me!,68460,4
68460,"I'm a pretty small person, 5'0 and petite but I have size 36DDD or 34 F (preferably) breasts.",68460,4
68460,"I knew in the back of my mind it wouldn't fit, but still went for it.",68460,4
68460,The material isn't great but for the price it's unbeatable.,68460,4
68460,Super cute bra though for anyone under a DD!,68460,4
68460,Keep in mind I ordered an XL and it fits okay under a regular lacy bra with no padding.,68460,4
68461,I love the saying on it but it's a little uncomfortable where the ring twists.,68461,4
68461,That's the only complaint I have.,68461,4
68462,I normally wear a size 32C bra and size small in this shirt fits me exactly.,68462,4
68462,If you want a more roomy fit I recommend getting a medium instead.,68462,4
68462,The quality of this shirt is not of the best but it will serve as a basic work shirt .,68462,4
68463,A nice warm hat for a little girl.,68463,4
68464,This fit better than I expected.,68464,4
68464,"I'm 5.5, 150 lbs and a 32c.",68464,4

68467,Will become a wardrobe staple,68467,4
68469,I wore these gloves the same day they were delivered.,68469,4
68469,Nice fit and they kept my hands warm but they're a little touchy with the touch screen.,68469,4
68469,"Meaning, I had to touch my touch screen multiple times to get it to register, but it does work.",68469,4
68470,Great colors but runs small,68470,4
68471,Look great on my ankle..!!,68471,4

68474,Sizing was smaller then expected.,68474,4
68475,"Took a long time to get, very thin material but pretty.",68475,4
68476,After a while the gold accents begin to fade.,68476,4

68477,good value for the money,68477,4
68478,If you're a medium order a small.,68478,4

68483,"I normally wear a size Small in US sizes and a Medium or Large in Asian sizes, so I ordered the Medium in Black.",68483,4
68483,"(For sizing purposes I'm 5'4 1/2, 30DD, and 115 lbs) As expected, it fits comfortably like a US small.",68483,4
68483,The material is also thick and warm and it doesn't have a cheap feel.,68483,4
68483,The diagonal zipper is a nice touch to this hoodie.,68483,4
68483,The only issue I have is that the arms aren't long enough.,68483,4
68483,"(But this isn't uncommon, as I have really long arms).",68483,4
68483,This hoodie took a month and a couple of days to arrive.,68483,4
68483,"-----
ETA(2017): Since having the hoodie for a bit, I've noticed that it does pill on the exterior after washing/ drying (compared to some of my other hoodies) ..so you might have to use a sweater shaver (or something similar) to get the lint balls off.",68483,4
68483,"Other than that, it's still holding strong.",68483,4
68484,"Very pretty, just the right size, not antique silver.",68484,4
68485,I bought this for my aunt who absolutely loved it.,68485,4
68485,I thought it was a little on the thin side but she was very happy with it.,68485,4

68510,Wish the pockets for holding stuff were a little bit more spacious.,68510,4
68511,"fits a bit awkwardly, but it is for lounging around so not much of a problem.",68511,4
68511,Mine had two left feet.,68511,4

68511,but still a cool item.,68511,4
68512,Its a little longer on the top white part than I wanted as I am petite so it doesn't fit perfect but for the price I really like it and it is comfortable,68512,4

68519,i love the color of this item.,68519,4
68519,the flower lining is a perfect add on.,68519,4
68519,the only thing i don't like is the sizing.,68519,4
68519,"i know its not suppose to be ""fitted"" but a bit smaller would have been preferred.",68519,4
68519,either way good item.,68519,4
68520,"The arm holes are a bit tight, but over time I guess the garter will give to a more comfortable state",68520,4
68521,It's a beautiful ring but I found it to be a tad too tight even though I wear the same size in other rings.,68521,4
68521,I gave it to my mom instead and she loves it.,68521,4
68521,Her fingers are slightly thinner than mine so it fit her perfect and she loves that the style matches almost anything she wears.,68521,4
68522,Great head piece for the price.,68522,4
68522,Be prepared to have to adjust a lot to get it the mesh where you want it.,68522,4
68522,The clip is really good and think I won't be having any issues with it sliding around much.,68522,4
68522,I'd recommend this seller.,68522,4
68523,"great sandal and pretty,  but not as comfy as my skeecher sandals",68523,4
68526,it was very cute and son loved it but the `10/12 is more like a size 6.  returned it.,68526,4
68527,"Nice looking belt, love how it works.",68527,4
68528,Liked just a little large.,68528,4
68528,I could have ordered one size smaller.,68528,4
68529,"Just a bit loose on me...overall, I love it!",68529,4
68531,my husband really likes these.,68531,4
68531,"they fit him fairly well, he wears them under his work shirts.",68531,4
68532,I have purchased this before.,68532,4
68532,The only thing I have to do is fix the arm holes.,68532,4
68532,The opening is really large.,68532,4
68534,"Nicely made, love the color",68534,4
68535,"I got this outfit for my son's first birthday, and it fit perfectly.",68535,4
68535,I would however recommend hand washing this shirt.,68535,4
68535,I threw this in the washer after his party and when I pulled it out the bow tie seems to be coming undone from the shirt.,68535,4
68535,"Not to big of a deal, seeing that he was able to wear it for his birthday.",68535,4
68536,The quality is good and it fits me (size 14.,68536,4
68536,US) but the skirt is really short.,68536,4
68536,Thats fine though because thats what leggins are for!,68536,4
68537,I bought these shoes for my son he seems to like them with no complaints.,68537,4
68538,"I love the quote, and never before have I been complimented on my clothes while working out until I wore this to the gym.",68538,4
68538,"It fits as expected, but I give everyone some advice: MEASURE YOURSELF!",68538,4
68538,"1) Pick your favorite shirt and lay it on a flat surface
2) Use a ruler or tape measure, and measure it from the inseam beneath the arm pits, straight across to the other (double your measurement to know your size)

Once you've measured yourself, you'll be able to figure out which size tank to get.",68538,4
68538,"Trust me, you need to know precisely because clothing can run smaller than they say.",68538,4
68538,"This tank, however, stretches.",68538,4
68538,"Maybe it's the fact that I carry a 30lb toddler around a lot and he has a tendency to stretch fabric, but my tank now goes to the center of my chest and the arm holes are rather wide.",68538,4
68538,"It's still a good quality tank, but the fabric is thin so keep in mind that it will stretch over time.",68538,4
68539,a little lose around the neck but I made adjustments and they're perf now,68539,4
68540,A little small but not much.,68540,4
68542,Great to wear around at parties and for casual wear,68542,4
68543,It's cute and modest and the size is as expected only I you follow the size chart!,68543,4
68543,"I'm 5'6 120lbs with a large bust, I'm usually a small/medium in US standards and ordered an XL and it's perfect!",68543,4
68543,"The fit is great, the color is beautiful and there is a lot of support in the busy area.",68543,4
68543,The only thing is when wet it takes quite a while to dry especially the bottom portion.,68543,4
68543,Exactly what I wanted,68543,4
68544,"They fit very,  very cute but made of see through material.",68544,4
68545,A bit hard to get in at first but good.,68545,4
68546,"My daughter wear size 10 in  regular USA Size , so this jacket was perfect for her
Why 4 stars because the fabric of the jacket was not stretch enough so make limitations in the movement of the arm",68546,4
68548,Too warm for Florida weather!,68548,4
68549,"I wear a medium, and I couldn't
T get them on.",68549,4
68549,"They do fit my 12 yr old though, so she inherited this pair of gloves and loves them.",68549,4
68550,Love everything about this dress just that it's a bit too small for the occasion which i buy it for,68550,4
68551,It's a little big for my ankle but all in all I really really like it.,68551,4
68551,I got it in the fall so Ive only gotten to wear it a few times.,68551,4
68551,I'll update if needed.,68551,4
68552,Came exactly as expected.,68552,4
68552,"Good material (for the price),  and fit exactly as it should have- believe I ordered a M for 5'4"" 130 lbs.",68552,4
68553,nice but on me top is a little large,68553,4
68554,"is not a ""petit"" dress, but it fix fine.",68554,4
68555,"Much bigger than I thought it would be, but still cute.",68555,4
68556,Got this to match mine for my wife and she loves it....and she's a jewelry snob.,68556,4
68556,She likes high end jewelry (Tiffany etc etc) and she loves this ring so far.,68556,4
68557,My 4 month old looks like a Power Ranger in this protective swimsuit.,68557,4
68557,It's super cute and does the job.,68557,4
68557,I just wish it had a zipper up the whole thing,68557,4
68558,great for casual wear and a light work top,68558,4
68559,"It was what I expected, held the right amount of cards and info.",68559,4
68559,"Cards are a little tricky to remove, their a tight fit.",68559,4
68560,Very pleased with the necklace!!,68560,4
68560,Length was great and the color was exactly as shown.,68560,4
68560,However the clasp would not open to make it longer.,68560,4
68561,Purchased this while it was on sale for Christmas.,68561,4
68561,I think they are a good value for what I paid.,68561,4
68561,The ones I received are cloudy and imperfections are visible to the eye if looking closely.,68561,4
68561,I did read the reviews and expected this to some degree.,68561,4
68562,They fit as expected,68562,4
68563,Wearing them as this is written.,68563,4
68563,"When I first got them, I was worried they were too childish.",68563,4
68563,The style hasn't really blossomed here in South Florida.,68563,4
68563,"Plus, these r confetti stars in the back of the earring.",68563,4
68563,I had imagined it to be a drawing on the back glass ball by looking at the pictures.,68563,4
68563,"But everybody complemented them; even my boyfriend who called the new fashion trend ""Keloid-tooking"".",68563,4
68563,I love them and wear them often with my hair ip.,68563,4
68563,The back is not too large; the flower front is gorgeous.,68563,4
68564,Nice color and looks cute for summer,68564,4
68565,My nephew was quite pleased with the shirts.,68565,4
68565,The only drawback is they arrived separately and one took quite a while before he got it.,68565,4
68566,Love the bright color,68566,4
68567,Haven't worn this yet but fits well and looking forward to wearing it!,68567,4
68568,These fit a bit smaller than expected in my opinion.,68568,4
68568,The colors and designs are pretty.,68568,4
68568,I think the price is a great value.,68568,4
68568,I find them quite comfortable.,68568,4
68569,My grahddaughter loved these.,68569,4
68570,I was very pleased with this top that I got it in two colors!,68570,4
68571,"Very beautiful mask , fits great, has too much gold though but with blond hair and fair skin - looked amazing",68571,4
68572,For me it was too large so I wear it to bed.,68572,4
68573,This purchased arrived earlier than expected in great shape.,68573,4
68573,"I wear a Medium or 7/8 in size, it it a little to large however suitable if I could redo this order though, I would order a small rather than a medium maybe in washing I can shrink it up a little, other than that this outfit is more than pretty, it has an open v back to it and is both classy and sexy, it can be worn just about anywhere casual dress.",68573,4
68573,I am looking forward to wearing it!,68573,4
68574,"I'm tiny (4'11'' 103lb), so it is common that clothes will be somewhat large on me.",68574,4
68574,"Regardless, it looks awesome!",68574,4
68574,I will post a picture sometime soon.,68574,4
68575,I bought these for my wife for Christmas.,68575,4
68575,She absolutely loves them!,68575,4
68576,This 3mm stainless steel figaro chain necklace is a perfect addition to every woman's jewelry collection.,68576,4
68576,"The sturdy metal stainless steel craftsmanship guarantees a strong ,fade resistant,rust and corrosion resistant and very low maintenance and yet high quality figaro necklace.",68576,4
68576,This necklace is hypoallergenic and safe for everyday wear because it is lead and nickel free.,68576,4
68576,"Also, you will never suffer the embarrassment of having the ""green neck""syndrome you experience from those cheaply made lead and copper products.",68576,4
68576,This is a premium stainless steel quality figaro necklace that is beautiful and well crafted.,68576,4
68576,"Also, the nice lobster claw clasp allows you to easily wear or remove the necklace without frustration and with the knowledge that your necklace will remain securely placed around your neck.",68576,4
68576,I purchased this product during an Amazon lightening deal and I must tell you that the discount is what originally tempted me to purchase this necklace but the quality is what made me fall in love with it.,68576,4
68576,This necklace is perfect for me.,68576,4
68578,"Looked good, though the image wasn't as sharp as I'd hoped.",68578,4
68578,Looked slightly blurry like they blew up the image a little too much.,68578,4
68579,Great shirt I love the logo.,68579,4
68579,I prefer to wear t-shirts on the larger side and this one ran about a size smaller.,68579,4
68580,This sucker is cute.,68580,4
68580,not too short but not too long.,68580,4
68581,Great item at a great price.,68581,4
68582,"Soft and very lightweight, perfect for the summer.",68582,4
68582,Love that it has pockets for my phone or other items while I'm around the house.,68582,4
68582,"Not amazing quality stitching, but I wasn't exactly expecting designer goods.",68582,4
68583,strange long strings hanging everywhere,68583,4
68584,The collar rips your hair out and it's painful.,68584,4
68584,Otherwise beautiful dress and true to size.,68584,4
68584,I accidentally ordered a medium but need a small.,68584,4
68585,Necklace is pretty but after wearing it for a while it starts turning color on the back.,68585,4
68585,It is a good purchase if you are not planning on wearing it everyday.,68585,4
68586,"Socks are nice and thick, very comfortable.",68586,4
68586,Purchased socks for an upcoming winter trip.,68586,4
68586,I'm hope they keep me warm.,68586,4
68587,"Dark green was a little more brown than expected and it made me look slightly bigger than I had hoped, but thats not too big of a deal.",68587,4
68587,More of a personal issue than a product issue,68587,4
68589,"The sleeves are a lot shorter than whts shown on the picture its a little pass my elbow, but other wise its a good product for its price.",68589,4
68590,It vents really well and my head barely broke a sweat when hiking the AZ desert.,68590,4
68590,I will say the size seems a little small; fits a little too snug on my head but I am hoping it loosens up as I wear it more.,68590,4
68591,Runs small so order one size up.,68591,4
68591,Also bra padding shows through so I had to wear a white tank top underneath it.,68591,4
68591,After that it was fine.,68591,4
68591,"Love the dress, but because of the white bra padding I gave it 4 stars.",68591,4
68591,Top is too sheer for the padding.,68591,4
68592,"Comfortable pants, lot of room to move.",68592,4
68593,i like the way it fits but i was expecting something bigger,68593,4
68594,Nice shirt but for me a little thin.,68594,4
68595,For the price you cant go wrong.,68595,4
68595,You'll probably want to repaint it to make it a little more realistic.,68595,4
68596,usually can wear a juniors large but ordered the extra large because of the reviews.,68596,4
68596,it is still a pretty snug fit while trying to put it on.,68596,4
68596,the color is more of a black and ivory not black and white,68596,4
68597,"Everyone loves this hat

Kinda foamy",68597,4
68598,"I'm actually really surprised, I wanted it 2 fit like it did on chick in pic, not identical, but it's not far off, dunno how long it will last after wash,  but till then, not bad!",68598,4
68599,Love the item but ordered a small because it's a stretchy type of material  (I'm not a small I'm a medium) & it's baggy on me even after washing and drying to shrink it...so a small is a large easily in my opinion,68599,4
68601,"Work perfectly, but fit a bit snug.",68601,4
68602,"Smaller that the size that I ordered, or what I'm use to.",68602,4
68603,The color is somewhat too similar to a hospital scrub...,68603,4
68604,I like this and as already in previous reviews...it is quite long.,68604,4
68604,I am 5'6 and it is long on me.,68604,4
68604,I want to wear it for a fashion type show and will likely wear very high heels.,68604,4
68604,If someone is very tall this would be perfect!,68604,4
68604,"As far as a top, I purchased a peasant lace top with a sash but am still searching for other options.",68604,4
68605,Happy with the product,68605,4
68606,I like the hat a lot the only down fall is needs more color options,68606,4
68607,"Heading to a bear event in Florida next week and wanted a few fun, well-fitting t-shirts, so I ordered three different designs from Ajaxx63.",68607,4
68607,I didn't want a dumpy potato sack cheap fitting t-shirt and was looking for a shirt with an athletic fit or tapered fit and snug fitting around the arms.,68607,4
68607,Reading the bullet point descriptions on several they sounded like just what I was looking for.,68607,4
68607,"I ordered three different designs but the problem was that they arrived printed on three different manufacturers t-shirts of varying quality, fit and construction.",68607,4
68607,"The three designs I ordered were all size XL:

If all three tshirts had been printed on this brand of shirt, Id already be ordering others and paying extra for overnight shipping.",68607,4
68607,Just feels like a high quality shirt.,68607,4
68607,Roomy in the chest with a slight taper to the waist.,68607,4
68607,Nice quality heavily ribbed neck and arm bands are comfortable and snug up lightly to my very average biceps; not tight at all yet miles away from flapping in the breeze like a cheap tshirt.,68607,4
68607,This was a win!,68607,4
68607,Great shirt at a great price.,68607,4

Medium quality t-shirt.",68607,4
68607,Nice fitting with a taper cut and the arms aren't flapping in the breeze.,68607,4
68607,T-shirt material seems a little thinner than the shirt described above.,68607,4
68607,The neck and arm bands are pretty average.,68607,4
68607,I really like the picture so I hope this shirt stands up to repeated washings.,68607,4

Funny enough this is the most expensive t-shirt out of the three ($8.00 more) and the one that pissed me off!",68607,4
68607,It is literally a HANES tagless t-shirt.,68607,4
68607,Ill wash it and see if the fit improves but its got wide arms and is long enough to wear as a mini-dress (too bad I don't do drag).,68607,4
68607,It feels and fits more like a t-shirt that your grandparents picked up in an airport souvenir shop on their way back from their vacation in Boca.,68607,4
68607,Total disappointment on this shirt.,68607,4
68607,"Ajaxx63 has some great emblem designs if they had consistency in the shirts they print on, Id definitely be a repeat customer.",68607,4
68608,I gave this 4 stars only due to the one size fits all option which limits most people.,68608,4
68608,I was hesitant to purchase due to the reviews because I am very tall and have a long torso and arms so I sometimes have a hard time with fit.,68608,4
68608,Also the too good to be true price!,68608,4
68608,But I was wrong the fit is great the colors and detail are exactly as pictured.,68608,4
68609,Perfect fit and support.,68609,4
68609,I really like these leggins.,68609,4
68610,The dress pattern is really pretty in person.,68610,4
68610,The material is a stretchy type that will stretch to your curves.,68610,4
68610,"Im 5'9"" with am hour glass shape and I bought an XL based off the reviews .",68610,4
68610,I wish I had bought a large because it's too large around my waist and it makes it look weird.,68610,4
68610,The length is really good and the way the top part fits is great.,68610,4
68611,top is puffy than I would like,68611,4
68612,The amount of jewelry that comes in this is amazing!,68612,4
68612,Tge metal seems to be made of great material and I would buy again!,68612,4
68612,"The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is because I used a BCR that came in it for my conch and it did not want to go in and once it was in, it didn't want to come out!",68612,4
68612,I know it is my fault but because of this it made me kind of have a resentment towards the jewelry!,68612,4
68612,Not the companies fault!,68612,4
68612,"Anyways, I absolutely love it all and I will be wearing the pieces but not in my conch!",68612,4
68613,funky set but not the best quality.,68613,4
68613,I will still make it work though!,68613,4
68614,The bracelet is very nice but I thought it might be adjustable and it's not.,68614,4
68615,Looks good and washes well.,68615,4
68616,These earrings are just what I needed to complete my rose gold ensemble.,68616,4
68616,The clasps are secure which is important to me.,68616,4
68616,I dislike losing hoop earrings because the clasps are loose.,68616,4
68616,"The only drawback, they could be a bit smaller for my taste.",68616,4
68618,My son was very happy with his Deadpool mask.,68618,4
68618,"Of course he got too warm in it as it is equivalent to wearing a ski mask, but he could easily take it off to cool his head for a bit and then put it back on.",68618,4
68618,Visibility through the mask was pretty good.,68618,4
68618,The mask arrived on time.,68618,4
68619,These are so comfortable.,68619,4
68619,"I was worried, when reading other reviews, but they never fell down, and I received  lots of compliments on them.",68619,4
68619,"I wore black boot shoes, and these cover the tops perfectly.",68619,4
68619,"I will be wearing these around the house, too, when the weather gets cold.",68619,4
68620,Logo started to fall off after a few washings but the sweatshirt and zipper are very well made.,68620,4

68621,should have ordered large,68621,4
68622,I cannot give a thorough review because I was not able to wear it as it was too small.,68622,4
68622,It ended being a gift for someone else.,68622,4
68622,But I can say that I like the material and the weight of the product.,68622,4
68622,"It is not for a long torso like the picture shows,",68622,4
68623,Nice looking hat for next Winter.,68623,4
68623,"It seems to be very warm ,and we'll made.",68623,4
68623,The only down side for me personally it is somewhat big but it's definitely workable.very unique looking as well.,68623,4
68624,For the price this is a good costume.,68624,4
68624,I'm not sure if its for me but I what I am happy to report is it is a true Plus Size Costume.,68624,4
68624,"I wear a standard
22/24 woman and the 3X fit pretty good.",68624,4
68624,Sleeves are a bit long as is the length but I have to wear flats.,68624,4

68626,Very comfortable I would highly recommend to anyone.,68626,4
68627,I have purchased Genie Bras before and knew which size to get.,68627,4
68627,They arrived sooner than the estimated date.,68627,4
68627,The box was obviously from a different batch of bras as the colors listed on the box were wrong but the bras inside the box were what I ordered.,68627,4
68627,The size tag which is stamped inside the back of the bra has already worn off whereas my older ones still have their product stamp and they seem a little thinner than my original Genie Bras.,68627,4
68628,I had a problem and they solved it!,68628,4
68629,I'd been eyeing this romper (in blue) for a while and finally bought it after seeing it look adorable on another blogger's site.,68629,4
68629,"So glad I did- it's a great buy, esp for the price!",68629,4
68629,"The colors are bright but not cheesey, the material is better than I expected, and the fit was great.",68629,4
68629,"I'm 5'5'' 130-135lbs athletic shape (small on top and muscular legs, normally size small in shirts and 4 pants) and it fit perfectly.",68629,4
68630,Overall this kigurumi is awesome.,68630,4
68630,"Roomy, comfortable, warm, and snuggly!",68630,4
68630,Looks cute as a button also!,68630,4
68630,I'm a little miffed though because despite ordering the XL the legs of the kigurumi are entirely too short for me.,68630,4
68630,"I'm 6' tall and I was hoping they'd fit closer to the ankle, but when worn without adjusting the bottom of the legs rides up past my mid-calf.",68630,4
68630,:( It's a little disappointing as the product is very warm and I would like for it to help keep my ankles warm as well.,68630,4
68630,"Because the bottom of the legs is banded and it rides up it's not the most comfortable, and it also makes it hard to find good long socks for coverage if wearing it with shoes/slippers.",68630,4
68631,I ended up returning it because it was way too big for my daughter's wrist.,68631,4
68633,Really nice swim suit but feels like your boobs will pop out,68633,4
68634,"very nice and LONG strap, one of the zippers is in backwards, didn't notice it at first",68634,4
68635,the only reason is a like because it doesn't fit.,68635,4
68635,size 10 is more like 6,68635,4
68636,"It was too big, but it was a lovely dress.",68636,4
68636,The fabric was so soft and comfortable.,68636,4
68637,"nice average shoe, only complaint is tongue of shoe sticks way up, but nice shoe for the price and my son likes them",68637,4
68638,"I'm not a fan of the fabric, but the fit is amazing.",68638,4
68638,"I'm 5'6, the suit was a little too short for me.",68638,4
68639,Well done for the price!,68639,4
68640,"very dark, you can hardly see through them",68640,4
68641,Handle with care because it streches a bit.,68641,4
68642,"The only thing wrong was that the arm wasn't completely sewed together, but I can fix it.",68642,4
68643,I have large calves and small ankles so they ride up my leg a bit but they are definitely comfortable.,68643,4
68644,The bag that they come in is cheap and it also doesn't come with a cleaning cloth like other glasses.,68644,4
68644,"For the price, you can't go wrong.",68644,4
68645,"This is a really good looking watch in person, but has a very big wrist band.. we may need to get a couple of notches removed.",68645,4
68645,And this was for a very large man!,68645,4
68646,It is a gift  but liked it and the packaging,68646,4
68647,narrower than appears in photo but very nice,68647,4
68648,The velvet on the costume keeps you warm,68648,4
68649,While shipping was fast I had no idea that a woman's extra large would be so small.,68649,4
68649,Men's large was even snug.,68649,4
68650,i love the dress it was a 2x and was way too small,68650,4
68652,dress is very beautiful but it does not fit as expected.,68652,4
68652,I usually wear a 14 and a 16 didn't fit me.,68652,4
68652,Buy 2 size up.,68652,4
68653,Great design and color.,68653,4
68653,"Top is tight, not made for a busty lady.",68653,4
68655,I got a medium and I am a 8 in jeans.,68655,4
68655,Love the material and length !,68655,4
68657,The bib part is a little large.,68657,4
68657,It comes up to my granddaughters neck before being tied.,68657,4
68658,"When I put them on you could hear threads breaking so I am wondering how long they will last, but they look and feel good.",68658,4
68659,"This is very pretty, soft, and has a key ring to hang keys off of it too.",68659,4
68659,"The only thing that I don't like,  which is why I didn't give it 5 stars, is that it doesn't clip closed to keep your cards safely enclosed inside.",68659,4
68659,They can fall out if yore not careful.,68659,4
68659,"Other than that, I love it.",68659,4
68660,It's nice to wear with a jacket or sweater runs a little small.,68660,4
68660,I wear a medium to large I bought an xlarge it fit well.,68660,4
68660,I'm glad I looked at the size chart first.,68660,4
68660,The front is not as see through as the back so you could get away without a tank if you're wearing a jacket.,68660,4
68660,If not just throw a white tank and it will be fine.,68660,4
68661,They are ok.  Not crazy about the material.,68661,4
68661,"Not as stretchy or soft as I would like, but stretchy enough.",68661,4
68661,"Also, they are 1 or 2 inches shorter than I like.",68661,4
68661,"Am 5'6"" 125 lbs.",68661,4
68661,Would not buy another pair.,68661,4
68662,Lovedd the bottoms the top wasn't quit as I imagined but wasn't terrible neither.,68662,4
68663,This is more of a nightgown than a sundress.,68663,4
68663,Comfy in the summer though.,68663,4
68665,my daughter loved these.,68665,4
68666,"Very cute, but runs small.",68666,4
68666,Order a size up!,68666,4
68667,It is beautiful but i phone 6 does not fit in it.,68667,4
68667,So I gave 4 stars,68667,4
68668,"Fits a toddler, but the quality of the material is rather cheap.",68668,4
68669,Very nice & sturdy weekend back.,68669,4
68669,Great to minimize overpacking ;),68669,4
68670,Comfortable but a little on the snug side.,68670,4
68671,Looks exactly right; material is a little thin.,68671,4
68672,This dress is quite comfortable and I get lots of complements when I wear it.,68672,4
68672,The neck is a little too low for my taste but it was easily altered without being obvious.,68672,4
68673,I love these shorts.,68673,4
68673,They're perfect for what I needed them for ;).,68673,4
68673,"When I got them out of the package, they looked soooo small.",68673,4
68673,I ordered an XXL and I'm a size 9/10 and have pretty big hips lol.,68673,4
68673,"I held them up and thought, ""there is no freaking way these are going to fit me.""",68673,4
68673,"So I tried them on and, much to my suprise, they fit perfectly.",68673,4
68673,I would order MUCH bigger than what you think you might be.,68673,4
68673,"Also, there was no button hole, so I just stuck my pocket knife in it and made one.",68673,4
68674,Not too thick material as the picture may appear.,68674,4
68674,"Could just do with a chin strap to stay on better in the wind, but you know there's no chin strap when buying so can't complain.",68674,4
68674,Happ with this purchase.,68674,4
68675,Covers my whole torso and it's a pretty good waist trainer because after a few days I'm already on the second row of hooks!,68675,4
68675,The material is also very nice.,68675,4
68676,We've been searching high and low for a dress for our almost 7 year old daughter for her aunt's wedding.,68676,4
68676,"This dress is well made, a beautiful color, and exactly what we have been looking for!",68676,4
68676,"Unfortunately, we're going to have to have it altered to fit her.",68676,4
68676,She is normally a size 6x/7 in standard clothes.,68676,4
68676,We ordered the 4 and it is still too big.,68676,4
68676,The length is appropriate but the bust is too large and the strap is too long.,68676,4
68676,She is a slim to average build and tall for her age.,68676,4
68676,I think with some professional altering this will work!,68676,4
68676,"However, it won't fit as ordered.",68676,4
68677,"I absolutely love the print of this bikini, however, the bottom is just slightly too small on me.",68677,4
68677,I still wore the top I just paired it with a solid white bikini bottom I already had.,68677,4
68677,"For reference I am 140 lbs, 5'9"" and size 34b...I got a large...the top also could have been a little tighter around my chest.",68677,4
68677,But I think for the price it was still worth it to just get the top.,68677,4
68677,It is really flattering and it made my breast look nice.,68677,4
68677,Really wish the bottom fit better though...,68677,4
68678,this dress is super cute but about a size to big,68678,4
68679,I love the color and the feel of the material.,68679,4
68679,I wish it was just a little more fitted in the waist.,68679,4
68679,I have a nice figure and would like it to fit and not be so baggy.,68679,4
68680,Awesome gloves nowhere near as stiff as I would have guessed they really fit and where almost like a normal pair of gloves,68680,4
68681,"Love these except that they do fall onto my babes eyes when in the car seat and she gets mad cause she can't see...but other then that, very cute",68681,4
68682,"Loved the fit of this dress, very flattering.",68682,4
68682,"However, fid not come with black belt as shown.",68682,4
68683,"Very nice dress, good quality.",68683,4
68683,The fit was small around the arms.,68683,4
68684,"Fit is ok, just need to redo the arm opening it's too tight.",68684,4
68685,I have a couple of Alex and Ani bracelets.,68685,4
68685,I thought I would wear this with.,68685,4
68685,It is definitely not the quality they are.,68685,4
68685,However for the price it is ok.,68685,4
68685,It is very big.,68685,4
68685,I would buy again though.,68685,4
68686,"Nice quality Koi top, but pockets are too small for me and won't fit my iphone 6s plus without the phone falling out when I sit down.",68686,4
68686,"but if that isn't a problem for you, it is a great top.",68686,4
68687,Nice leggings but didn't cover me fully.,68687,4
68688,These are cheap and comfortable.,68688,4
68688,"Not perfect, but I didn't expect that.",68688,4
68688,The padding in the black one was normally shaped.,68688,4
68688,The pink and beige are a bit pointy.,68688,4
68688,I'm wondering if washing will improve or worsen the shape.,68688,4
68688,"But again, they're fine for just trying to be comfortable if I'm home.",68688,4
68690,"I like it, but did not review the dimensions prior to purchasing, and found it to be too small for what I needed.",68690,4
68690,I still use it though!,68690,4
68691,I have a lot of Citizens and other high end denim.,68691,4
68691,"These fit snug, some stretch, but not a ton, slightly tighter in the thighs.",68691,4
68691,"Perfect length and love the high waist, looks good on the booty.",68691,4
68691,"I am 5'2"" petite, size 0-2, slim/curvy, small waist, 32DDs and a booty.",68691,4
68691,"More of an hour glass figure, but petite, the high waist is perfect for me & comfortable.",68691,4
68691,"Not as much ""stretch"" as my hudsons, jbrands, 7s or other citizens, but these are nice and sexy and hold their shape.",68691,4
68691,"I got a 25 (my normal size) they stretch a bit, but not a ton, so I wear them on my more ""skinny"" days!",68691,4
68691,"The color is perfect for casual or dressing up, crop length is perfect and modern.",68691,4
68691,"Highly recommend, wear them on your more ""skinny"" days and you'll feel amazing.",68691,4
68691,Great for a date night or fun brunch with heels or wedges can also pair with flats or flip flops for more casual days.,68691,4
68693,"Top a little big, but will work.",68693,4
68694,Attractive and well made,68694,4
68695,I thought it was white and blue it is actually more cream and blue but nice hat.,68695,4
68696,A few months old.,68696,4
68696,"Could have been constructed a little better, I know it'll fail within a year probably.",68696,4
68696,Also it got stained black pretty quickly but I like the worn look anyway.,68696,4
68696,A miracle I haven't broken the zipper but I wasn't expecting a zipper function anyway.,68696,4
68698,Order 2 sizes bigger,68698,4
68700,Was on the lighter weight side so an undershirt would be good!,68700,4
68701,I had already purchased several pair of this brand of capri's and yoga pants so I was disappointed that this pair did not fit the same.,68701,4
68701,This one runs a little small.,68701,4
68702,If your a medium I recommend people to size up because it runs small.,68702,4
68702,The quality and look of the product is awesome 5 stars for that but the sizing is off.,68702,4
68702,My cousin is a medium and that fit her small she berly had space to move in the outfit..,68702,4
68703,Inside strip is done partially from plastic.,68703,4
68703,And the one that should hold the helmet on head is more decorative than useful.,68703,4
68703,Except of that this pith helmet is great!,68703,4
68705,Almost perfect fit but arms are a little tight.,68705,4
68705,A size larger may have been too big however.,68705,4
68706,The fabric is luxurious feeling.,68706,4
68707,The shirt is ok.,68707,4
68707,The material could be nicer and the cuts could be cleaner but for the price it makes sense.,68707,4
68708,Got this for 8th Grade Graduation.,68708,4
68708,"The measurements were correct on the website but when we got it, it just wouldn't zip up in the back.",68708,4
68708,"I understand that not all dresses are the same and that sizes vary for different brands and styles, but this was very disappointing, because it was a very cute dress and I loved the way it looked.",68708,4
68710,"When purchasing your kilt, be sure to measure with a pair of pants on and no belt.",68710,4
68710,Great looking and durable kilt.,68710,4
68710,Using the kilt for a wedding.,68710,4
68711,Shipping was a little slow.,68711,4
68711,That thing to be large from my head.,68711,4
68713,This outfit is a lot better than I expected.,68713,4
68713,"I'm a size 14/16 on bottom with a smaller bust (40C), waist and wide hips.",68713,4
68713,The material is very comfortable and has nice stretch to it.,68713,4
68713,It's light weight and hugs the curves.,68713,4
68713,"Unfortunately the top is a bit too big but just as other reviews stated, the top runs larger.",68713,4
68713,"Other than that, I can't wait to wear it out on the town :)",68713,4
68714,"I like it enough to wear it, the cut is a tad short in the sleeves and torso length.",68714,4
68714,The lining is through the body and arms so it is difficult to layer anything with long sleeves underneath.,68714,4
68714,Very comfortable with a tank top underneath.,68714,4
68715,I have had so many compliments on it.,68715,4
68716,The color is beautiful and vivid.,68716,4
68716,"I'm a 36C and I got a medium, the bra part is push up and was too small for me, too exposing.",68716,4
68717,"The opal looks exactly like the picture, maybe even more beautiful!",68717,4
68717,"The only con is that the gap was too big for my nose, but that's an easy fix.",68717,4
68717,"Other than that, I love it",68717,4
68718,A great classic look for my kid.,68718,4
68718,Look much more expensive than they actually are and have held up well so far.,68718,4
68719,"I purchased two of these necklaces; one for myself and one for my daughter, for aromatherapy use.",68719,4
68719,The design is beautiful and well made.,68719,4
68719,My concern is for the ring from which the lobster clasp pendant attaches to the necklace.,68719,4
68719,"It is flimsy and the ring has opened and separated twice while my daughter was at school, and once on my own chain.",68719,4
68719,The pendants have fallen off.,68719,4
68719,We are not rough with the necklaces...there is truly a weak link in this otherwise beautiful design.,68719,4
68719,"If you purchase it, be prepared to purchase a new chain or reinforce the attachment loop.",68719,4
68720,Trying to get rim flat.,68720,4
68721,too small but great customer service,68721,4
68723,I got this in a medium and exchanged it for a large mostly for a larger cup size.,68723,4
68723,I'm a 36D/34DD and it's still a little small in the chest but fine.,68723,4
68723,It's very comfortable and stretchy and I'm very picky about sleeping in lace.,68723,4
68724,I really like this kimono.,68724,4
68724,"However,  compaired to the other kimonos I've ordered from Amazon, this one runs small.",68724,4
68724,"It fits, but there's not enough extra material in the front to pull closed for if you wanted to cover up your front.",68724,4
68725,I like this swimsuit the color is beautiful the fit is a bit small.,68725,4
68726,Perfect fit for my almost 2 year old son.,68726,4
68726,My only complaint is that the string that attaches both tears off very easily.,68726,4
68726,This caused us to loose a few before coming up with a backup plan.,68726,4
68726,"However, you really can't beat the price for the amount.",68726,4
68727,Purchased for my son's Halloween costume.,68727,4
68727,Was able to adjust it small enough for a 6 year old's head.,68727,4
68728,A really cute item but it does run quite small so I ordered a few sizes up.,68728,4
68729,Very cute and she loves it.,68729,4
68730,"My son loves these shoes, they are a bit shorter and definitely narrower than his high top Vans though.",68730,4
68730,Wish I would have ordered 1/2 a size bigger so they would fit a while longer.,68730,4
68730,He can only wear them with real thin socks.,68730,4
68730,If you have a wide foot you might want to pick a different shoe since there is no way to adjust them.,68730,4
68731,Everything was ripping so I just sewed them back together myself.,68731,4
68732,Sooo cute but seems to fit like a medium..,68732,4
68732,I'm a 2/4 normally so I ordered a small.,68732,4
68733,I purchased this in Red in my normal size (large) and it fits great/looks great.,68733,4
68733,"I tried two other blouses found on Amazon that look identical to this one but have different labels, and I liked this brand the best.",68733,4
68735,"True to size and soft and comfy, my son loved it.",68735,4
68738,Lovely soft material and I like the style.,68738,4
68738,"Deducted one star because it is way too long (I'm 5'5"").",68738,4
68738,"For a tall person, it will be fine.",68738,4
68738,Material has a good weight to it.,68738,4
68738,I like the hip belt too.,68738,4
68738,Great for an evening out with friends or casual lunch date.,68738,4
68738,Can dress up or down.,68738,4
68739,I bought the bags as a birth day present  for my mother and she loved them.,68739,4
68739,The material was better than I expected and the little bear was definitely a plus.,68739,4
68739,My grandmother was also around and she decided to take one of those bags for herself saying she also needed one and since there were four there should be no problem lol.,68739,4
68741,Bought these for my husband.,68741,4
68741,The fabric is great.,68741,4
68741,"The fit is snug, but is not uncomfortable because of the stretchable fabric.",68741,4
68742,Maybe it's because I'm only 5'1 but this dress was a little too long for my liking but other than that the dress fit great and everything was perfect it came in just the right amount of time and the dress is overall stunning I got so many compliments Homecoming night!,68742,4
68743,"It's ""men's"" product nevertheless it looks good with lady's jeans.",68743,4
68743,Easily accommodates a sufficient amount of bills (folded twice).,68743,4
68743,But it was shorter than expected.,68743,4
68743,I needed to make an additional hole almost on the very tip of the belt.,68743,4
68743,"Bought size 8(M), my waist is 28"".",68743,4
68744,Too big but very cute.,68744,4
68744,Maybe in a year or two.,68744,4
68745,It's pretty good for 3 dollars,68745,4
68747,Not as exctied about the stiffness of the lace but great value for the price!,68747,4
68749,"Great leggings, I've had them for about a year now and they've held up.",68749,4
68749,"My only complaint is that because they are small, the seams started gapping the first time I wore them and now you can see the threads in the crotch/butt seams.",68749,4
68749,"But for the price, that's not such a tragedy.",68749,4
68749,"The fabric is also that slick/shiny style, so these are more for fashion than comfy cuddle leggings, but they're still comfortable.",68749,4
68750,I am pleased with my purchase of the womens hooded jacket.,68750,4
68750,The coat is very warm which is important as I live in Chicago where we can get temperatures that are very low at times.,68750,4
68750,I like the look of the jacket also.,68750,4
68750,The snaps on the front and sides are secure and allow for a small adjustment in the fit of the coat.,68750,4
68750,The contrasting colors are also nice.,68750,4
68750,The hood is roomy and almost eliminates the need for a separate hat.,68750,4
68750,I would purchase similar items from this company again.,68750,4
68752,Very cute and well made for the price.,68752,4
68752,My measurements were in between a medium and large.,68752,4
68752,The medium fit better.,68752,4
68752,The fabric is a stretchy cotton blend material.,68752,4
68752,The skirt is full but isn't too poofy which is a bonus to me.,68752,4
68752,the belt is a little flimsy and long but its fine.,68752,4
68753,Cute dress way better looking then I expected and it fits well.,68753,4
68753,But then again this dress is only made for certain torsos,68753,4
68754,Made great gifts and were very well received.,68754,4
68755,The pants weren't flattering because they were a bit big.,68755,4
68755,Im going to return and get a size smaller.,68755,4
68755,I originally ordered the asian M (us xs) but im going to return it for thr asian S (us xxs).,68755,4
68755,The butt pockets were too tiny in my opinion.,68755,4
68755,Its wide enough to perfectly fit my samsung s4 wide but half of it would hang out the top.,68755,4
68755,I feel like if you bend over it would fall out in an instant.,68755,4
68755,"And ladies with bigger butts, the pocket would be even more awkwardly small.",68755,4
68755,Ill give another review when i try one that fits how it should.,68755,4
68755,Btw i don't have hips but i do have some butt.,68755,4
68755,Im 5 feet and around 100 to 115 lbs.,68755,4
68755,Usually i am an xs in yoga/running pants and jegging/leggings.,68755,4
68755,But i fit the M leggings at forever 21.,68755,4
68755,"I think it may have to do with my height, that pants too big fit weird on my crotch area, way too loosely.",68755,4
68757,The fit was nice!,68757,4
68757,Came at the right time for this event I was attending!,68757,4
68757,I received a lot of compliments '.,68757,4
68757,I stayed clean all night lol but the only thing bad about the outfit is that the belt made it dirty.,68757,4
68758,Runs a little tighter in the arms,68758,4
68759,"Fit is good, but the halter strings need to be longer.",68759,4
68760,"Not sure I would use this on the beach, and not what I purchased it for, but if you are one that has a tendency to get cold inside shops/restaurants in the summer or are ever visiting tourist sites that might require you to cover your shoulders then keep this in your bag.",68760,4
68760,"It was hot, I was wearing a tank top and had to buy a scarf to use as a shawl so I could visit some churches in Rome and this would have been perfect!",68760,4
68760,"In terms of size, it's a one size fits all and it really should fit just about anyone, just don't expect it to be as blousy as shown in the picture.",68760,4
68760,"I'm a size 6-8 and, while still a bit blousy, the sleeves look more like regular sleeves on me than the loose fit you see in the picture.",68760,4
68761,Very good deal... good quality for the money.,68761,4
68762,"Looks decently made, but docking 1 star because I measure them to be 1.4mm in diameter, and not 1.5mm as claimed.",68762,4
68762,"Also, I'll echo a tip I read in the comments in case it gets lost.",68762,4
68762,"The case consists of a top and bottom half, taped all around when it arrives.",68762,4
68762,"If you cut all around and pull them apart, be very careful as you risk jolting the spring bars out of their slots and you'll be in for a bad day.",68762,4
68762,"Instead, cut around the sides and the front only.",68762,4
68762,The remaining tape on the back will serve as a hinge.,68762,4
68763,Cool concept and the watch works well.,68763,4
68763,"It took me a couple minutes to figure out how to set the date and time, but was easy.",68763,4
68763,My only complaint is that the face is larger and stiff so it doesn't form well to a smaller wrist.,68763,4
68764,It is such a pretty set.,68764,4
68764,I've gotten plenty of compliments.,68764,4
68765,"I actually love the set, however, the earrings are so heavy, that pull/stretch my earlobes.",68765,4
68765,I am going to see if there are such as things as a wide backs that would slide up the fish wire.,68765,4
68766,The leather is very hard and seems to be leatherette.,68766,4
68766,But my son wanted them and he likes them.,68766,4
68767,"This came before the expected date, packaged neatly and with no rips, frays, zipper problems, or other blemishes.",68767,4
68767,"Amazon said they'd cancel my order if it didn't ship in a certain amount of time, but most of the wait on the dress is its production, so I knew the long period before shipping was  to be expected.",68767,4
68767,I emailed the vendor and asked if they could contact Amazon and ensure a valid transaction.,68767,4
68767,"They were very friendly and said it would come, and it did!",68767,4
68767,"I'm 5'6"", 130lbs, a 34B bra, and waist 27"".",68767,4
68767,I bought a size 4 and it couldn't have fit more perfectly!,68767,4
68767,Both my parents were floored by how custom it looked!,68767,4
68767,And the tulle wasn't too poofy or too long for me at all.,68767,4
68767,"No alterations needed there :)

This has a lower waistline than I expected, which I think looks a little frumpy, but my sisters say it looks fine.",68767,4
68767,"It's not a slimming dress, but a pretty shape nonetheless.",68767,4
68767,"The lace is very pretty and true to the photo, but very itchy.",68767,4
68767,I'll definitely have to figure out a remedy for that before spending a night in it at prom - maybe a full lining of softer material.,68767,4
68767,"I ordered mine in pink, which is shown as a warm blush color, but mine was just a little more fuchsia.",68767,4
68767,"(Not nearly as much as the photos look, they don't do it justice.",68767,4
68767,It really is close to the hue of the pink dress shown.),68767,4
68767,"I love that the buttons on the back are fake so I can just zip it up, but upon opening the package, it didn't sit quite right and you can see the zipper underneath.",68767,4
68767,May have to put a hook-and-eye on the back to close that up.,68767,4
68767,"As far as the neckline, the front of mine looked like the photo, but it didn't dip down in the back like that.",68767,4
68767,The back was as high as the front on mine.,68767,4
68767,"But in the other photo reviews, it looks like one girl's came with a sweetheart neckline!",68767,4
68767,So you have to be up for a bargain with the neckline and the back!,68767,4
68767,"It's a gorgeous dress, EXACTLY my size, and I feel like a princess in it!",68767,4
68767,"For $65, it was definitely worth it.",68767,4
68767,"If this is near the top of your price range, I'd say go for it.",68767,4
68767,"If you can afford more, you can find a more flattering version of this dress.",68767,4
68767,I know there are 3+ other Amazon vendors who sell the same dress at higher prices.,68767,4
68768,NICE FOR THE PRICE,68768,4
68770,"5'8"" 140lbs & I purchased a size Large in black & size XL in gold because I read it runs small.",68770,4
68770,(Normally I'd buy size medium).,68770,4
68770,The Large fits well but the XL is loose on me.,68770,4
68770,"If you want the dress to be tight against the skin, purchase ONE size up from your usual.",68770,4
68770,"If you want a more loose fitting dress, purchase TWO sizes up from your usual.",68770,4
68770,"I am returning the XL but keeping the L. The dress obviously isn't the highest quality when you look closely, but since you usually can't/don't wear sequins dresses all the time, the price & quality are just right for what it is.",68770,4
68770,The sequins don't fall off as they are sewn onto the fabric the dress is made of (not glued like some cheaper fabrics).,68770,4
68770,I reordered the gold in size large because I think this is a great dress!,68770,4
68771,"I like it but ladies, take fair warning, there is absolutely NO coverage in the important areas.",68771,4
68771,"Totally all lace, no 2nd layer to hide the goodies.",68771,4
68771,"Even more noticeable in white than black bra (I ordered both), fyi.",68771,4
68771,Picture a little deceptive.,68771,4
68771,Model in white bra has pasties on under this bra.,68771,4
68771,"Unless you zoom in, you don't notice that.",68771,4
68771,"And how lace is positioned across breast, that lace does nothing to hide the the goodies, no matter your skin color.",68771,4
68771,"Also got it in black, not as noticeable but still pretty ineffective bra in that sense.",68771,4
68771,Unique & different tho.,68771,4
68773,"I am 5' 5"" and typically about 145 lbs.",68773,4
68773,I bought this to wear as maternity skirt.,68773,4
68773,"It's very comfortable, but I will return it and get the XL because I'm not sure the L is roomy enough to get me through my pregnancy.",68773,4
68774,"A beautiful wallet, but I wish It could hold more.",68774,4
68775,They are just ok but nothing to get excited about.,68775,4
68775,The only thing is that they are somewhat large.,68775,4
68776,no belt with it,68776,4
68777,Got it to go with the bag.,68777,4
68777,Love the zip feature.,68777,4
68777,But not enough credit card slots and they fit to tight.,68777,4
68777,Good number of sections.,68777,4
68777,Smells a bit musty at first..aired it and the bag out first.,68777,4
68778,Very nice and well-made for the price.,68778,4
68779,We always buy the size up in IPlay products.,68779,4
68782,Bought it for my mom as a birthday present.,68782,4
68782,She is very pleased with it.,68782,4
68782,My only issue is that the butterfly never stays upright like it does in the picture.,68782,4
68782,I'm a little OCD so things like that bother me.,68782,4
68782,My mom loves it tho.,68782,4
68782,If she can live with it like that then so can it.,68782,4
68783,My waist size for pants is 33 and the 34 kilt was too small.,68783,4
68783,"Returned it for a 36, which is slightly too big but the buckles on the side make it a comfortable fit.",68783,4
68783,"Slightly big is also beneficial in that, since the fabric is very stiff and won't stretch, you can still sit down comfortably.",68783,4
68783,"Overall, I'm very satisfied.",68783,4
68784,"The stomach are is a bit large for me, however, that's is probably just due to my body type",68784,4
68785,Should've ordered a M. Chose to order a L due to Asian clothes running smaller.,68785,4
68785,It is decent quality.,68785,4
68785,Not really a dress to wear out but if you do it the right way it might be possible.,68785,4
68785,I'm using it to wear under see thru dresses it will work for that purpose.,68785,4
68787,Somewhat small but cute,68787,4
68788,"bought this for a gift for my nephew,  Havent givine it to him yet,,however he loves dinosaurs so i know he will love it",68788,4
68789,I have received a lot of compliments on this bag.,68789,4
68789,"I have heard it looks like a ""hippy"" bag, but I think it just has a relaxed, easy going charm about it.",68789,4
68789,I love the fact I can carry a lot of items in it.,68789,4
68789,I do appreciate the outer and inner zipper pockets.,68789,4
68789,"For me, the inside sleeves for phones are pretty useless.",68789,4
68789,"My phone just slides out because of the soft sides, and I have to dig for it on the bottom.",68789,4
68789,"I've used it every day for about 5 months now, and it still looks new.",68789,4
68789,"I haven't had to wash/clean it yet, but I imagine it would do well on a gentle cycle in the washer to freshen it up.",68789,4
68789,"The straps do seem a bit wimpy to me, but have held up well.",68789,4
68789,"The faux leather looks cheap, but again, has held up.",68789,4
68789,The hardware connecting the straps to the bag are very sturdy.,68789,4
68789,"Love having the option of wearing it cross body, on my shoulder, or in the crook of my arm.",68789,4
68789,"Overall, I would purchase again if the designers made the phone sleeves deeper or maybe put a snap or velcro closure to keep a phone from sliding out.",68789,4
68791,This was sold as a 3XL but it fits like a 2XL from any other clothier.,68791,4
68792,"The bracelet is really pretty, just like the picture.",68792,4
68792,But the string is extremely thin and it looks like it can break easily.,68792,4
68793,"Good price, fits great",68793,4
68794,The quality is good but the is a little small in my head,68794,4
68795,"Came in great condition and worked well, however, don't carry too much in it or the strap will break!",68795,4
68795,It is annoying to fix if this happens.,68795,4
68797,I absolutely love LA beast and bought this as a Christmas gift for my friend who introduced me to this channel.,68797,4
68797,I have to say this shirt is much uglier in person.,68797,4
68797,I'm not sure if this is intentional but in all fairness it's probably due to the image being stretched.,68797,4
68797,"But other then that, it's a nice shirt",68797,4
68798,Was for a costume so it was great but I would never wear otherwise...quality not great!,68798,4
68799,I am always hesitant to buy direct from China...,68799,4
68799,But I was surprised that it was as expected and the little gift with was a nice touch too,68799,4
68800,This was the best I could find.,68800,4
68800,The sleeve for the passport is larger than post others.,68800,4
68800,Even those which cost significantly more.,68800,4
68800,It has more sleeves for credit cards than you will need when traveling....but I guess that is okay.,68800,4
68800,The outside sleeve holds your plane ticket for easy access.,68800,4
68801,used the clothing chart and sizes posted to order the correct size,68801,4
68802,The bra cup doesnt fit.,68802,4
68802,"But its me, not the suit",68802,4
68803,Not sure how the print will hold up after a few washes.,68803,4
68803,The tank is super soft and light but the print feels rough to the touch.,68803,4
68804,"I didn't get this, but I got instead a glow in the dark locket.",68804,4
68804,I love it and it's beautiful and not what I expected haha just wasn't what it says it is.,68804,4
68805,Item was just as described.,68805,4
68806,I'd say that they run 1.5 inches smaller on the waist and 1 inch short in length.,68806,4
68807,The dress is just as pictured.,68807,4
68807,Has a very retro style.,68807,4
68807,I like it very much!,68807,4
68808,Just make sure you buy a size larger than you usually wear and you'll be fine,68808,4
68809,Looks like the photo.,68809,4
68809,"thin material as is the more colorful variation, decent quality.",68809,4
68810,The coat is super cute but way too small - if you have any kind of bust to speak of you will be unable to button the coat.,68810,4
68810,Would work well with a small teenage frame - yes even the 2x.,68810,4
68810,"Again super cute coat, I will end up giving it away to someone that will truly be able to enjoy it.",68810,4
68811,I was worried about sizing after I read the reviews but decided to order it anyways.,68811,4
68811,"I'm 5'3"" 115 lbs and it fit perfectly around my waist .",68811,4
68811,"It covers my butt but just barley, I'll be rocking it on weekends but definitely not work appropriate.",68811,4
68813,Really good quality fabric.,68813,4
68813,But runs extremely small.,68813,4
68813,"I wear a 16-18 normally, and the 5X was actually too small.",68813,4
68815,"Well, for me personally these bras will not work (if you are a larger D cup prior to pregnancy they probably won't fit you either) but for the price I thought the quality was good and the material felt alright.",68815,4
68816,These are wonderfully soft and adorable.,68816,4
68816,The only downfall in my opinion is the shortness of the legs.,68816,4
68816,I read the reviews stating this but at barely over 5 ft I thought a small would be fine.,68816,4
68816,The legs do however ride up even on me.,68816,4
68816,I just wear longer socks to accommodate.,68816,4
68817,"Love it ,it fit me really nice",68817,4
68818,This suit fits great.,68818,4
68818,It also makes me look slimmer from the front.,68818,4
68819,Fits big..but good quality.,68819,4
68820,This wallet is good I like the material what it make from it fit just right in my back pocket so smooth.,68820,4
68820,I give it 4 stars why cause there is always room for improvement.,68820,4
68821,I was actually expecting a deep fuchsia sweater with grey flecks as depicted in the picture.,68821,4
68821,What I received instead is a plain (bright) magenta sweater.,68821,4
68821,"The sweater arrived 17days ahead of the expected time, and fits beautifully though.",68821,4
68821,"Looks fragile, and I'm guessing machine-washing wouldn't be a great idea.",68821,4
68821,"It sits well on the shoulder, and fit me just as I'd hoped it would - I'm not big on the baggy-baggy look.",68821,4
68821,"I'd likely get it in five other colours (Nep crme, beige, black, brown, burgundy) - either from this seller or another.",68821,4
68821,And in same size too - medium 8/10.,68821,4
68821,Altogether a good product.,68821,4
68823,Really pretty but the fit was a little off.,68823,4
68823,The bottom was too big in the stomach area.,68823,4
68824,I bought numerous bags for work before this one and this one works perfect for my needs.,68824,4
68824,I wanted a sturdy bag that wasn't heavy since I have neck and back problems and this is perfect.,68824,4
68824,it has enough room to carry books and coloring books without them getting bent or damaged.,68824,4
68824,also many different sized pockets so there's places to keep all the things you need and want to carry.,68824,4
68824,"Another plus is its stayed in one piece, no rips, loose strings, and the zippers are sturdy.",68824,4
68825,"Surprised by some shiny fibers in the mix, but attractive and warm.",68825,4
68826,"She still loved it, and if anything she'll have room to grow into it.",68826,4
68827,"When I first got it, I needed to trim a decent amount of loose threads, but once finished you couldn't even tell.",68827,4
68827,I spend a lot of my day wearing this pulling it back up towards my neck.,68827,4
68827,"I could blame this on wearing a very soft t-shirt underneath, but I feel as if I should have ordered down a size.",68827,4
68827,I usually wear a size 6-8 and ordered a M.,68827,4
68828,The sleeves were a bit long but I always have to have sleeves altered on off the shelf coats.,68828,4
68829,"I always shop for reasonably priced garment with good quality and a touch of street style... After going through my pregnancy and postpartum recovery, I absolutely has fallen in love with the maternity clothes, and am looking for clothes with the same qualities ever since: stretchy yet body hugging, soft but not see through neutral colored clothes that can be wear both indoors and outdoors when I have to take the baby to run errands etc.",68829,4
68829,I love this dress mainly for its comfortability and I adore the color grey.,68829,4
68829,"I am 5'3 and 140lb, and this dress fits as expected.",68829,4
68831,"I'm petite (5'0"", 100 lbs) so it's a little oversized but I get compliments EVERY time I wear this!",68831,4
68831,Its warm enough for fall and warmer winter days but lightweight enough to keep on all day.,68831,4
68833,"If you typically wear a large T shirt, then get XL, or even XXL",68833,4
68834,Loved the dress but it is cut a bit on the small side.,68834,4
68835,I like how it came earlier than it was supposed to and that it wasn't too big or too small.,68835,4
68836,Thought the dress runs too small.,68836,4
68836,I usually wear medium so I bought xl but the dress was true to the size .,68836,4
68836,Material is kinda stretchy,68836,4
68837,"This Ritchie Calf Leather watch strap looks elegant and feels like fine, expensive suede.",68837,4
68837,Sellers should include 2 spring bars in the deal.,68837,4
68837,"When I inserted by old spring bars, the fit was very loose instead of a sturdy, tight fit.",68837,4
68837,The bars kept sliding out.,68837,4
68837,"But once, secured onto the watch, the strap worked okay, though.",68837,4
68838,I searched for women's sweats and these fit like Men's sweats.,68838,4
68839,Cute item but is a little big.,68839,4
68839,I thought that the shirt would be a little thicker.,68839,4
68839,"Overall I'm happy, just sad it's a little big.",68839,4
68840,We love these slippers but they are way too big!,68840,4
68840,Size large for our 20 month old.,68840,4
68840,"We had a smaller size when our baby was younger and they were the cutest, softest, warmest slippers.",68840,4
68840,And they had great traction on our tile floors.,68840,4
68841,"I'm not crazy about these, but my daughter LOVES them.",68841,4
68841,They are veeeeery thin though.,68841,4
68842,"The only reason I gave 4 stars is because, it takes about 2 - 3 attempts before the latch closes.",68842,4
68842,"Other than that, it's very beautiful and looks richer than it is.",68842,4
68843,I've had this ring in for about 2 months and it's starting to change colors a little bit.,68843,4
68843,I still think it's cute just not as cute as when I first put it in.,68843,4
68843,I'll probably just wind up buying another one because of how cheap it is.,68843,4
68844,Classic style - reminds me of Tom Selleck's specks in Blue Bloods.,68844,4
68844,Reality is that they fit my husband well and he says he doesn't have to squint in the sunshine now.,68844,4
68846,"Great quality, I wear this everyday and I immediately noticed a charge of a little more energy with this cold nasty weather (I'm from Chicagoland in Illinois).",68846,4
68846,The energy flow is great and I would wear it wrapped as a bracelet if I didn't want to wear as a necklace.,68846,4
68846,"After about two weeks, the metal on it had already tarnished from the sterling silver to about a rusty copper color.",68846,4
68846,"That was the only disappointment, but then again, with constant use, natural oils of the skin will make it tarnish the more that you wear it..",68846,4
68846,"Overall, these are great for meditation and also just to wear all day around and it helps with feeling clarity also when meditating.",68846,4
68847,Jacket was late in delivery by 2 weeks but was worth it.,68847,4
68847,The weathered down print looks authentic from Force Awakens style worn by Finn.,68847,4
68847,Fits perfectly for me in L size.,68847,4
68847,Im in Ht 1.72m chest 36.,68847,4
68847,So i kinda need to wear boots that wiil boost me to 1.77m to look tall in it.,68847,4
68847,Inside the seams are well stiched.,68847,4
68848,I bought this for my Dad and he usually wears and XL - this fit him true to size.,68848,4
68848,It is made out of good quality fabric that doesn't seem too thin.,68848,4
68848,It's a perfect gift for any motorcycle enthusiast grandpas!,68848,4
68849,Flattering silhouette but runs small!,68849,4
68850,I am 5' 6'' and about 160 lbs I tend to wear size 10 or mediums.,68850,4
68850,These pants were a nice cut and would be fairly comfy if they weren't so tight in the hips.,68850,4
68850,I am going to send them back and buy a size up.,68850,4
68850,I cannot speak to the pants longevity but the pockets were sizable.,68850,4
68850,I also liked the material.,68850,4
68851,"The shirt is very cute, seems to be good quality, and looks just like it is pictured.",68851,4
68851,"However, it is advertised as relaxed fit, and it definitely is not.",68851,4
68851,I would order up at least one size.,68851,4
68852,"I usually wear a small in street clothes for all my tops and this top does fit, it is just a little snug in the chest.",68852,4
68852,"(I am a 34D, 5'5"", and approx.",68852,4
68852,"But the zipper is great, and the pull strings on the sides make it a more custom fit.",68852,4
68852,I haven't worn it in the water yet but I did wear it in the sun and it's not as breathable as I would want it to be but I still think it is a good value and very stylish.,68852,4
68852,"With the pull strings all the way extended, the shirt even covers my bottom.",68852,4
68853,"Nice looking tie, I get lots of compliments.",68853,4
68853,"I wish it was a little longer, but still love the tie!",68853,4
68854,Thin material but cute romper!,68854,4
68855,Fits as expected like its says they run small so be sure to get a size bigger than you normally are.,68855,4
68855,Quality of material is good and comfortable to wear.,68855,4
68856,Order a side up.,68856,4
68857,Haunt washed yet but past purchases kept color.,68857,4
68858,"This dress is very pretty and well made, but I found that it runs large.",68858,4
68858,"I am 5'3"" and 130 pounds.",68858,4
68858,I normally wear a small/medium or 4/6.,68858,4
68858,I ordered the medium in this dress and it was overwhelming on my body.,68858,4
68858,I don't even think the small would have fit.,68858,4
68858,I believe this dress requires sexy curves and a large chest.,68858,4
68859,"Husband loved these, soft and very comfortable.",68859,4
68859,Kind of pricey so I don't think he'll be ordering a drawer full.,68859,4
68860,"MUCH bigger than I expected though, I wish they had this exact some purse in a smaller size!",68860,4
68861,Yes she loved it,68861,4
68862,"My husband love this jacket,  a little disappointed because one of the button came loose as soon as he tried it on but overall Great",68862,4
68863,I bought these sneakers for boot camp class.,68863,4
68863,They are very light weight and different than other sneakers that I have owned.,68863,4
68863,"Have only used them a few times, but like them so far.",68863,4
68864,I like it but its way to big,68864,4
68865,Love these jeans so comfortable and they arrived early!,68865,4
68865,I will be purchasing in other colors,68865,4
68866,My wife loved it!,68866,4
68867,"Very sexy, got compliments on the bathing suit when I wore it.",68867,4
68867,I feel that the sides can make you look unflattering if you aren't exactly in th best shape.,68867,4
68867,I definitely lost a few pounds before wearing.,68867,4
68867,The back can be a little small if you have a large bum like mine.,68867,4
68867,I'm happy I purchased it though,68867,4
68868,Fit is good too.,68868,4
68869,Exactly as pictured...material is stretchy but thin and kind of shiny like costume clothing but I plan to sew a layer of black lace over both and it'll be great!,68869,4
68871,"A little larger than I expected, but great compacity.",68871,4
68871,Seems very sturdy and well made.,68871,4
68871,I recommend it to any EXO fan.,68871,4
68872,Little too tight for my husband's wrist.,68872,4
68873,"""Pearls"" actually look like pearls.",68873,4
68874,"I bought one at Dillards this weekend for $90, there are subtle differences.",68874,4
68874,The most obvious is that the Dillard's version has a 3rd button on the collar which i like and makes the shirt more stylish for the weekends.,68874,4
68874,"Second, the collar on the Dillards shirt is the same material as the shirt, which is a smooth soft cotton.",68874,4
68874,This shirt did have a smooth collar but not as smooth and it was ribbed.,68874,4
68874,I think for the price I'm happy but in the future may just spend the extra $40 and get the highest quality Ralph Lauren Polo possible.,68874,4
68874,"Maybe this was a previous years design, regardless I'm happy with the product I have received it is legitimate, high quality and fits well.",68874,4
68875,The Color of the red matched my outfit perfect.,68875,4
68875,"I did not like the wire part of yhe necklace, it looked and felt like it was choking me.",68875,4
68875,so I just picked up a clearance necklace at Wal=MArt and took off what was on it and put it on this.,68875,4
68875,Earings are slightly heavy bu not to bad.,68875,4
68875,I got lots of compliments on it at the wedding...,68875,4
68875,"It only took a week to come, the purse I ordered from the same vendor later that  same evening, As I didn't see it when I ordered this necklace set, the purse took nearly 3 weeks to come AFTER the the week the necklace set came.",68875,4
68875,IN fact it didn't come in time so I had to buy a different purse.,68875,4
68875,THe purse arrived the next DAY.,68875,4
68875,If your not in a hurry I would recommend this set.,68875,4
68875,and do like I did and I got a $2.00 necklace set at Walmart and used the chain on it for this set.,68875,4
68875,I may even buy another set in a different color since I liked it so well,68875,4
68876,Fit is pretty accurate.,68876,4
68876,I like that they are not skin tight.,68876,4
68876,They are a little box shaped.,68876,4
68877,Nice fabric but ran just a bit small,68877,4
68878,Nice and comfortable fits great,68878,4
68879,Quality and color is great.,68879,4
68879,"I love the fabric, perfect for summer days and for beach parties.",68879,4
68879,I ordered an M and could have ordered S. It is a bit larger than I thought.,68879,4
68881,I purchased a medium and it's a perfect fit.,68881,4
68881,"I am 5ft 6, 135lbs and my waist is about 30 inch, hips 38 for reference.",68881,4
68881,"Beautiful skirt, very flattering fit.",68881,4
68881,I would highly recommend it.,68881,4
68882,"Wore it to a wedding, I am 6'0 tall weight 176... Great length and great dress.",68882,4

Deux Lux Womens NYC Weekender  Taupe  Size 26 x 14 x 11  $155.00
By: Megan Collison  4.0 out of 5.0 Stars  February 9, 2016

Being a person who spends weekends away from home, I purchased this tote to satisfy my weekend packing needs.",68883,4
68883,"If you are like me, when you travel you like to have all your makeup along with a variety of clothing options.",68883,4
68883,"When evaluating this weekender with others, this bag rose above the rest due to a combination of traits.",68883,4
68883,"More specifically, us professional packers/travelers are looking for a bag that is large enough to fit our over packing needs, comfortable and easy to carry, tasteful enough to look fashionable, and durable to keep up with our many weekend adventures.",68883,4
68883,"Needless to say, it is important to be very particular when selecting a weekender style bag.",68883,4
68883,Size: This tote is deceiving in that you worry that you may not fit everything inside at first glance.,68883,4
68883,"However, the slouch design along with the widened zipper opening of the bag allows for ample space.",68883,4
68883,"If everything does not fit in the bag, leaving the zippers open is always an alternative.",68883,4
68883,Pockets: The two patch pockets combined with the zip pocket on the interior sides of the bag give you the perfect hiding spot for those smaller items.,68883,4
68883,This allows the user to keep items upright or in a safe place to avoid losing.,68883,4
68883,Handles: This weekender provides a couple different options to comfortably transport it.,68883,4
68883,"The two handles along with the adjustable/removable shoulder strap, allows for you to change positions of the bag while carrying it.",68883,4
68883,The two handles make it easier to transport it short distances or in and out of vehicles.,68883,4
68883,"Material: This 100% Polyurethane bag is ideal in the fact it is waterproof, washable, flexible, and lightweight.",68883,4
68883,"It is also a cheaper, lower maintenance alternative to leather.",68883,4
68883,"The material will scuff, for example if drug along the sidewalk, but there are small feet on the bottom of the bag to help prevent this from happening.",68883,4
68883,The 100% cotton interior also is beneficial so if you have product leakage it is possible to clean it.,68883,4
68883,Style: This weekender is a good combination of function and fashion.,68883,4
68883,"It is an attractive, affordable bag with a name brand look.",68883,4
68883,The simple design and coloring gives it a timeless appearance.,68883,4
68883,"The interior has gold accents, which make it unique in its kind.",68883,4
68883,"If looking for a weekender style bag, I would encourage taking this tote into consideration for the reasons listed above.",68883,4
68883,Thank you for reading.,68883,4
68884,The black shirt was a more tight fit than the grey.,68884,4
68884,Both still fit though,68884,4
68885,quick ship and shoes are working out well for the restaurant work,68885,4
68886,"good quality for the price, very similar weight and feel to original.",68886,4
68887,Fit as expected and delivered on time.,68887,4
68889,Could only give 4 stars.,68889,4
68889,Top portion is out of proportion to the bottom.,68889,4
68889,I wear a tank top underneath.,68889,4
68889,I love the feel of the fabric and very comfortable.,68889,4
68890,Heavier fabric than I saw from the reviews.,68890,4
68891,Quality of these gloves feels great.,68891,4
68891,I haven't used them yet in the cold but I think they will keep my hands warm skiing.,68891,4
68891,They do run big.,68891,4
68891,I had ordered the unisex black M ones first and they were huge and then the white M women's and I am keeping them but still on the big side and I have big hands.,68891,4
68892,There's really nothing special to say.,68892,4
68892,It's a good value for the price.,68892,4
68892,"Doesn't really do a lot of lifting, but it does make it possible to wear a bra when you wouldn't otherwise be able to wear one.",68892,4
68892,The entire cup is sticky.,68892,4
68892,There isn't a little dot of nonstick for the most sensitive areas like I have had in previous stick-ons.,68892,4
68892,I just add a tiny dab of shea butter to prevent stick and irritation in those areas.,68892,4
68894,Followed others advice and bought a size larger.,68894,4
68894,Metal garter clips would get it 5 stars.,68894,4
68894,Would be great for date-night under a dress if it would stay clipped.,68894,4
68894,Wear your own panties.,68894,4
68895,The fit is too disproportionate.,68895,4
68895,Tighter and shorter than expected.,68895,4
68895,I like the dresses.,68895,4
68895,Will return this and maybe get larger size.,68895,4
68895,This is my second dress.,68895,4
68896,"Very sexy blouse, but the Medium size definitely fit more like a small on me.",68896,4
68896,I would suggest ordering a size up if you're a curvier woman.,68896,4
68897,Too small for my large head.,68897,4
68897,Only comes in the one size.,68897,4
68898,The top is a bit large ans had to be tied with a hair tie in the back - but the bottoms fit great!,68898,4
68898,And she looked so cute!,68898,4
68899,Came faster than i expected.,68899,4
68899,"A lil to long but,fo da $.. Why complain!",68899,4
68900,Material was a little different from what I expected.,68900,4
68901,"I really like this nursing bra, it gives a nice shape and is enough support I can wear under day clothes out of the house.",68901,4
68901,"Love the light pink color, great for under light clothes.",68901,4
68901,"Only complaints are that I think the straps stretch out a bit easily, particularly the fabric portion that is the support while nursing.",68901,4
68901,Also it is pilling already after only a couple months of use.,68901,4
68901,"But for the price I like it, and it is very comfortable.",68901,4
68902,Sweat pants are good but a little too long.,68902,4
68903,A little expensive but very handy.,68903,4
68903,The tubes are well made and sturdy.,68903,4
68904,"Love it,except smelt like gasoline when arrived,which goes away.",68904,4
68905,Certainly not for babies.,68905,4
68905,Very flimsy but cute for toddlers,68905,4
68906,Product arrived in good shape,68906,4
68907,"Pros:
I love this pack so much!",68907,4
68907,I use it nearly every single day!,68907,4
68907,I bought one at a retail store several years ago and didn't realize how much I'd be using it.,68907,4
68907,Searched for more several times but could never find any.,68907,4
68907,Finally found them here and was super excited to order a couple more!,68907,4
68907,It's perfect size to hold my iPhone 7 in the zipper compartment.,68907,4
68907,I keep my credit cards and moola in a small binder in the Velcro pouch in front.,68907,4
68907,"I don't usually carry a purse anymore - I just bring a nylon shopping-type bag with me, along with this small pack and pull it out when I go into stores.",68907,4
68907,On another important note: the larger zipper compartment is big enough to hold my 380 hand gun when I'm at the ranch.,68907,4
68907,"Cons: (Why I gave 4 stars and not 5)
* The elastic band seems to start coming apart more quickly than expected.",68907,4
68907,"However, it looks like it would be easy to repair if necessary.",68907,4
68907,* I wish they'd made the front compartment with a zipper as well to secure the contents better.,68907,4
68907,"I've never had anything fall out of it, but it would give me more peace of mind if it zipped.",68907,4
68908,They're pants and they fit correctly.,68908,4
68908,Is that enough for you?,68908,4
68909,The t-shirt is a bit misleading.,68909,4
68909,"The design actually stretches all the way down the shirt, not just the chest area.",68909,4
68909,It actually looks better this way but people should still know what they are getting.,68909,4
68910,The material seems thinner than before.,68910,4
68911,This charm along with the grandma charm are lovely.,68911,4
68911,They both meet expectation.,68911,4
68912,The fabric and pattern are great.,68912,4
68912,The top fits perfect.,68912,4
68912,My only qualm is that I wish that the bottoms had a bit more fabric.,68912,4
68912,"They fit better than I expected, not super tight to give that puffy/muffin top look, but wish they came up a little more for coverage on the back and front side.",68912,4
68912,Don't mind the tan lines...bought this suit to work on that.,68912,4
68913,"I like them,but they are snug,I followed the sizing chart but maybe should have gone to a larger size,
They are sexy,and the shorts don't leave much to the imagination..I'm sure to be getting some looks.",68913,4
68914,"These were high-quality shoes, but were on the large side.",68914,4
68914,"They fit our daughter's length of her feet, but we were way too wide through the aides and ankles especially.",68914,4
68914,They kept falling off.,68914,4
68915,He loved them and has waen them multiple times.,68915,4
68915,They are and look exactly like what is described.,68915,4
68915,They are a really nice pair of short and can be warn dressed up or dressed down!,68915,4
68916,"No chest support what so ever, So be aware of that before you buy it but other than that it is a beautiful summer dress and I love it!",68916,4
68917,Placed my order for the workout pants & it took a little bit to fill the order & ship it out to me but I am happy with the pants.,68917,4
68917,They fit as expected for workout wear form fitting.,68917,4
68917,I would order from this vendor again.,68917,4
68918,"Okay, here is the scoop.",68918,4
68918,"The bag is perfect in size, and colors are awesome.",68918,4
68918,Here is what I did find that I didn't really like.,68918,4
68918,I know what a bucket with draw strings is supposed to be like.,68918,4
68918,The rope that's not really rope they had on the bag is like 5-6 inches too short.,68918,4
68918,Makes it so u cant open the bag fully.,68918,4
68918,"Secondly, I had not noticed this before, but there are NO pockets on or in this bag.",68918,4
68918,"I had a couple of organizers that I haven't used in years, because all my other bags have a lot of pockets in them; I pulled them out to fix the problem.",68918,4
68918,"Then, I really had to fix the opening problem cause if I didn't the opening would drive me nuts and I would end up getting rid of it.",68918,4
68918,"So, I found one of my scarves that have the same colors on it and threaded them through.",68918,4
68918,"I took the plastic, rope/cord and tassels off and used the scarf.",68918,4
68918,"Not only did this fix the problem, but it made it look REALLY cute!",68918,4
68918,"As soon as I get my hot glue gun out and attach the organizer to the inside, this bag is good to go.",68918,4
68918,"I gave it a four out of five stars cause, I do like the bag, the other star was just out of range considering its a DIY special.",68918,4
68920,Great quality but ran big,68920,4
68921,im 5'1 so a little long.,68921,4
68921,"i ordered this for a trip to cancun, would def be better for prom.",68921,4
68921,beautiful dress  comes as shown in pictures,68921,4
68922,Love the coat but a tad small.,68922,4
68923,"The band isn't great quality, but that can be replaced if someone really wants a different band.",68923,4
68923,"The watch however is much bigger than I anticipated, so not quite the feminine look I was going for.",68923,4
68923,"Will be returning and the search for a lovely, yet sporty, feminine red watch continues......",68923,4
68926,"It is perfect for tucking that ""extra skin"" from having a child.",68926,4
68927,Excellent value for money,68927,4
68928,Wish the clasp was better quality.,68928,4
68929,When I placed too many cards into one of the pockets some of the stitching snapped.,68929,4
68929,Still looks nice and works great though.,68929,4
68931,"But too small for my 7.5-7.75"" wrist.",68931,4
68931,"Gifted it to my tiny, petite mom ;)",68931,4
68932,I like but don't love this hat.,68932,4
68932,"The rim is a good size, but it looked like the cap portion would be larger.",68932,4
68932,"I have hair that is an inch past my shoulder, and it doesn't really fit tucked up inside the cap :(",68932,4
68933,"I knew going in that this hat was khaki colored, not pink.",68933,4
68933,But what arrived was more light tan than the green color shown in other pictures online.,68933,4
68933,Not a huge deal.,68933,4
68935,"If I had to order it again, I would probably order a slightly more expensive one and see if it has a little better fit.",68935,4
68935,"This one will work, and is worth the price, but a little loose/large.",68935,4
68936,Its looks exactly like the product pictures.,68936,4
68936,Was delivered before the expected delivery date.,68936,4
68936,The chain seems a little thin though for such a big pendant but it is holding so far.,68936,4
68938,good hat on a windy day,68938,4
68939,"Great, especially for the price.",68939,4
68939,"I was worried about it being running small, so I bought a size larger.",68939,4
68939,Could have just bought my original size.,68939,4
68940,this is not exactly as pictured but very pretty nonetheless.,68940,4
68940,I love the detail and the examples.,68940,4
68940,The only downside is the bra is a bit loose.,68940,4
68941,The inside lining is not very appealing but the outside is super nice.,68941,4
68941,The quality is super and I really like it.,68941,4
68942,"great jean, just too long, they are more for a taller person, I'm 5'5"", they were way too long on me, but comfortable.",68942,4
68944,charges my casio really fast.,68944,4
68944,only problem that i have is on eof the led lights keeps flickering.,68944,4

68945,This is a very nice bag.,68945,4
68945,"A little larger than I am used too, but I would recommend it.",68945,4
68946,Thus is a great buy & it shipped really quick there's alot of jewelry the only thing I don't like is there's not alot of choices but it's still great & I definitely recommend for anyone that has alot of piercings like me,68946,4
68947,I get a lot of compliments on these and really love that the lenses are large enough to cover my whole eye!,68947,4
68947,Stylish AND great functionality.,68947,4
68948,This is a really pretty purse.,68948,4
68948,I like that the liner is gray and not black - for easier seeing into it.,68948,4
68948,I like the satchel handles and that it zips and has an easy clasp.,68948,4
68948,The drawback to me is that it is really stiff and with arthritis in my hands makes it a little harder to search.,68948,4
68948,For most folks it should be fine.,68948,4
68948,Perhaps it will get more flexible with use.,68948,4
68948,I would like it a little smaller and with a wider opening.,68948,4
68948,But it is really snazzy looking!,68948,4
68950,Happy with this product,68950,4
68952,They arrived and everything works.,68952,4
68952,"It has different colors to choose, he only has to strap it works great for him since he doesn't like to tie his sneakers.",68952,4
68952,"Only reason I'm giving a 4 is because I am not letting him out on until school begins, so I can't say its comfortable for my child.",68952,4
68953,It was great until it unexpectedly broke into a million pieces.,68953,4
68954,This particular cut ran a bit small.,68954,4
68954,I ordered a large instead of my usual medium.,68954,4
68954,"Love the vibrant color and the banded pattern though, very flattering.",68954,4
68954,I have numerous pieces from Sunsets Swimsuits and I really love the brand.,68954,4
68955,I purchased a size down because of the reviews and was happy that it fit well!,68955,4
68955,"These run big, but if you are tall, it will still be very short.",68955,4
68956,Loved it fit perfectly can't wait for summer!,68956,4
68957,"It was a gift for bf, he love it..",68957,4
68958,"Very pretty diamonds, look great.",68958,4
68958,"A little small, but were as advertised and as expected for price.",68958,4
68961,I would have to go a waist size larger to fit an inside the waistband holster.,68961,4
68962,This runs VERY small and is very fitted.,68962,4
68962,Ordering you usual size or even a size up will not result in a fit as pictured on the model.,68962,4
68962,I usually wear a medium.,68962,4
68962,"I wanted a loose fit, so after reading reviews, I ordered an extra large.",68962,4
68962,"When received, measuring across the front just below the bottom of the armholes, the sweat shirt measured 22 inches (presumably equivalent to a 44 inch bust/chest measurement).",68962,4
68962,"After washing in cold water and drying for 10 minutes on low heat, it measured 20 inches (or about 40 inches around) so take this into consideration when ordering.",68962,4
68962,"It is also not ""straight"" like a typical sweatshirt but much more fitted.",68962,4
68962,While it's not what I wanted it is very cute and a nice quality fabric despite the shrink factor.,68962,4
68962,It is also cut lower at the neckline than a typical sweatshirt which makes it look really nice.,68962,4
68962,"Although it will probably be a little large on her, I think my daughter (a size 2-4) will really enjoy it.",68962,4
68962,"Also, the ""navy"" color is a very dark navy, almost black.",68962,4
68963,**I did not get this on discount or as a free product.,68963,4
68963,"I purchased after basic research of the product and reviews/ratings-
 Good bracelet that was worth the money.",68963,4
68963,Just a bit snug on an avg size wrist.,68963,4
68963,I bought 2 jade bracelets at the same time and they were both nice but i like the other slightly better because it had a nice charm as well.,68963,4
68963,"#REAL review for real buyers like myself,  just looking to get the best quality at the best price.",68963,4
68964,Fit is body con and fabric is clingy knit.,68964,4
68964,"Comfy and cute, however the red is a very bright tomato red, not the color in photo.",68964,4
68966,LOVE the dress underneath.,68966,4
68966,It was a bit small and a little shorter than I like.,68966,4
68966,I am short waisted so unfortunately having the skirt on made me look stumpy.,68966,4
68966,":-(  Also the skirt was made for like an Amazonian woman evem woth 4.5"" heels.",68966,4
68966,"It was even too long for my 6'4"" husband to be.",68966,4
68966,So plan on having it hemmed.,68966,4
68967,The fit of the shoe is good to an extent.,68967,4
68967,I bought them for my fittness competition.,68967,4
68967,"All the reviews I read about these ellie shoes, even all the different styles are about the same.",68967,4
68967,I am normally a shoe size 6.5 so I got a 7.,68967,4
68967,I am so glad I did.,68967,4
68967,I think if i got a size 6 my foot woukdbt fit through the tow part of the shoe.,68967,4
68967,Like the other reviews the toe part is small.,68967,4
68967,I have to wear them every night in order to stretch that out.,68967,4
68967,The top back strap of the heel was a little big.,68967,4
68967,I had to poke an extra hole in the strap in order the top part to fit better.,68967,4
68967,These are the tallest shoes I have ever worn.,68967,4
68967,If your feet are not used to them they are going to be very uncomfortable at first.,68967,4
68967,That's why I have been putting them on every night to stretch them a little so my foot doesn't feel so cramped.,68967,4
68967,Overall they make my legs looks so long I don't think you will find anything better.,68967,4
68967,Epically these types of shoes for a fitness conpetition.,68967,4
68968,I've worn these to work out for 5 days in a row now.,68968,4
68968,"Initially, my arches ached but over time the discomfort subsided entirely.",68968,4
68968,"I've done everything from bootcamps, resistance training, running and Zumba.",68968,4
68968,"So yeah.., they are truly crosstrainers ;-)",68968,4
68969,By mistake I ordered 2 of these one in size L & one in size XL.,68969,4
68969,I am the hospital & had the L sent directly to me in hospital & XL was sent to my home.,68969,4
68969,"I am about 5'1"" & knew the dress would need to be hemmed & it does.",68969,4
68969,What surprised me was that the top was rather tight.,68969,4
68969,"I have narrow shoulders & my bust is on the smallish size therefore when the top was a little tight in a Large, I was really surprised.",68969,4
68969,This is the reason for 4 stars vs 5.,68969,4
68969,I really like the dress which I have been wearing all day in my hospital bed.,68969,4
68969,I think women should keep this in mind & order up as far as they can.,68969,4
68969,The dress is adorable & I have been receiving many compliments when I get out of bed.,68969,4
68969,I am being discharged on Thurs & will write about the XL when I try it on.,68969,4
68971,the colors are duller than the picture of amazon,68971,4
68972,Too large but still like the dress,68972,4
68973,This is not a compretion vest but it does the Job.,68973,4
68973,I really sweat sooner I wear it doing home chores.,68973,4
68973,I love running with it only 1 problem was that it roll ups when I working out but I really happy with the vest,68973,4
68974,Not like the big shoes or small sweatpants that I had ordered,68974,4
68975,"Looks great, exactly the dimensions advertised.",68975,4
68975,"One thing though, the back of the 'feather' bit on the arrow is plain so if it rolls around when wearing it (which happens with jewellery), the effect is lost slightly.",68975,4
68976,"They fit me fine, but I'm short.",68976,4
68976,Someone taller might find them too short.,68976,4
68977,Honestly thought the medium would be too small for me but it fits so great!!,68977,4
68977,I'm 5'1 and 117.,68977,4
68977,Definitely the bottoms are a little snug but it's not uncomfortable at all to me.,68977,4
68977,Love love loveee this bathing suit.,68977,4
68978,I gave four stars because the bust was very tight (I'm a 36E+ and couldn't wear a bra with it) but it fit perfectly everywhere else!,68978,4
68978,Very flattering on me at 8 months pregnant.,68978,4
68979,Turned out to be a great product.,68979,4
68979,Much better quality than I expected.,68979,4
68979,Definitely designed to be a costume not to fight other ninjas while wearing.,68979,4
68979,I was worried about the sizing.,68979,4
68979,I did not get an email asking my sizes like another reviewer claims to have received.,68979,4
68979,I ordered the Medium and it fit like a perfect.,68979,4
68979,"I wear 30/30 pants, 8 1/2 on shoes, 23 inch headband, and 36 1/2"" chest.",68979,4
68979,The shirt is a little tight.,68979,4
68979,It came in about 2 weeks.,68979,4
68979,I give the 4 out of 5 stars just because of the ambiguous sizing.,68979,4
68980,"They are a bit wide and short...but other than that they are very good....i got them exclusively for running to replace Lynco insoles that i have used for years, but the company changed them drastically, to the point i find them useless :-( The price of the Powerstep insoles is much better than Lynco too",68980,4
68982,My 9 year old can wear a 12-14 pants and the medium fit her fine.,68982,4
68982,I ordered a small which was great for her 7 year old sister.,68982,4
68983,My daughter loved them,68983,4
68984,Great product I think it's adorable and fits me well.,68984,4
68984,"I can't wait to wear it to the next show but I'm a little frustrated by the sizes..I ordered a ""large"" and it is no where near a large I'd say more like a small/medium.",68984,4
68984,"Being a former thicker woman I feel like as a rave/EDM company you should have at least one size bigger then the ""Large"" for all women of shapes and sizes..not just for thinner women.",68984,4
68985,I reordered these hats hoping my first order was a fluke with the large size.,68985,4
68985,I lucked out I got a black one and a dark grey one and they both fit perfectly.,68985,4
68986,I like it it's cute!,68986,4
68987,"I wear medium, so I ordered large, it fit perfect.",68987,4
68989,"It fit as expected, I am smaller on top and bigger on the bottom, especially through my hips.",68989,4
68989,"In general, I am a size 2 through the waist, but a size 8-10 through the hips.",68989,4
68989,The size small fit well.,68989,4
68989,It was a little loose on top but not so much that I was swimming in it.,68989,4
68989,It was comfy and casual for a girls lunch date.,68989,4
68989,:) I may buy a second one.,68989,4
68990,"its cute, nice material, looks just like the picture, im 5'6 117 lbs fit me perfectly.",68990,4
68990,the straps do fall off sometimes though so i gotta get some rubber strap grips.,68990,4
68991,not your average pair of sun glasses you would buy at khols,68991,4
68992,"Great jacket, bought it off season, so have not used it yet...",68992,4
68994,Thicker than I was expecting but great quality.,68994,4
68995,It fit's great and is very warm.,68995,4
68996,"I think it warned us that the sizing was small, so I got a larger size.",68996,4
68996,"Still, I am a petite person and it sure doesn't drape on me like it does on the model.",68996,4
68996,"I like it anyway but it fits like a regular sweater, not a loose tunic.",68996,4
68997,The packet came in a couple of days which was fine.,68997,4
68997,I got the shirt size small and it fit a bit too small and the material is also a little thin.,68997,4
68997,my younger sister liked still so she kept it so I guess it's fine.,68997,4
68998,cape coat is very nice and pairs well with a lot of outfits.,68998,4
68999,It was for a birthday gift.,68999,4
68999,The person seemed to like it.,68999,4
69000,It' feels a bit big where the skirt begins.,69000,4
69000,The fall of the dress is not the best right below the tight area.,69000,4
69001,Shiny adjustable I am happy with this purchase.,69001,4
69001,It is a beautiful ring I suggest if you have long fingers it will work well,69001,4
69003,"This ring is really cute, but its big on me.",69003,4
69003,"I tried to get a size 7, but they were out of that size.",69003,4
69003,"I wear it on my middle finger and it still big, but its really cute.",69003,4
69004,They are really cute with bright lights.,69004,4
69004,I just wish the lights would last a bit longer.,69004,4
69005,Nice hoodie for Spring and Fall but size is a little on the small side.,69005,4
69005,Wish I had exchanged it,69005,4
69006,Al in all its nice and arrived really quick.,69006,4
69006,The only complaint I have is it was a bit big.,69006,4
69007,I bought a Chinese knock-off of the Adam's hat.,69007,4
69007,It was pretty well made and comfortable.,69007,4
69007,"I can't speak to durability or any comparison to the ""real"" product that this is based on.",69007,4
69007,"Ended up giving this hat to my landscaper, as he liked the look and could make better use of it.",69007,4
69007,"If you have the few extra bucks, I'd recommend going with the genuine Adam's product.",69007,4
69007,"However, I'd think this knock-off should hold up with normal use.",69007,4
69007,I'll report back with any add'l feedback from my landscaper.,69007,4
69008,Order at least one size up.,69008,4
69009,But it very nick shirt .,69009,4
69010,Nice shirt that fits as expected.,69010,4
69010,The material is kind of starchy/stiff.,69010,4
69010,I'm hoping after I wash it enough times it'll soften.,69010,4
69010,"If the material had been softer, I would've given it 5 stars.",69010,4
69011,The coat looks real nice and good quality.,69011,4
69011,But after I put on a coat and was surprised that I could not zip up the coat.,69011,4
69011,I looked at the tag and realized that Amazon sent me the wrong size.,69011,4
69011,I ordered a large and got the medium.,69011,4
69011,They need to pay close attention before ship out.,69011,4
69012,Beautiful dress for the price!,69012,4
69012,"Very happy with my choice...I ordered a size 14 in the light coral color and it fits great, color looks almost exactly like shown in the picture.",69012,4
69012,"It's a tad big in the bust and a little long, but I can work with it.",69012,4
69012,"I'm 5'8"" and generally a size 16.",69012,4
69012,I ordered this on Saturday and it was at my door 4 days later!,69012,4
69013,I really liked this purse but it was way too big for me;so if you like big bags youll love this one!,69013,4
69015,"I like this shirt... very cute on, easy to care for.",69015,4
69015,I prefer to hang dry and lightly iron for the best wear and flow of the material,69015,4
69016,I love this gown and wear it most nights.,69016,4
69016,It's a little big (I ordered 2x) but I thought it would shrink... it hasn't after 2 washes.,69016,4
69016,I am keeping it and will probably order another in a size smaller.,69016,4
69018,Was inexpensive and a good buy.,69018,4
69018,"My daughter wears it everytime she goes in the pool, even just around the house sometimes.",69018,4
69018,The top fits kind of weird but she's a happy girl so i can't ask for more.,69018,4
69019,very pretty but runs a bit small!,69019,4
69021,nice - but almost the least coverage of any of the ones I have tried.,69021,4
69021,order the correct waist size - but if you got flesh to spare you may want to look elsewhere,69021,4
69022,This is the second time I have ordered these.,69022,4
69022,I like that they fit close to my face and no glare gets in around the edges and very comfortable..The frame above the lens snapped on the first pair so I ordered 2 this time to have a back up.,69022,4
69023,"good shirt, good price",69023,4
69024,Necklace is so beautiful I love it!,69024,4

69026,"Super cute, feels amazing on, its very silky smooth and feminine.",69026,4
69026,Great for boys and girls.,69026,4
69026,I ordered XXL because sometimes xl are a little tight.,69026,4
69026,Xl would have been perfect.,69026,4
69028,I decided to purchase these for my 18 month old daughter for a trip to Manila.,69028,4
69028,My daughter loves shoes so she decided that she wanted to wear them around before we left.,69028,4
69028,They fit just right for a size six.,69028,4
69028,They seem to be comfortable and and are pretty easy to slip on and off.,69028,4
69028,The only downfall they have is the number of stray strings on the inside near the toe area.,69028,4
69028,"This is typically expected when first used, but they don't seem to be letting up after slbeing worn for a while.",69028,4
69028,"If not for this, they would get five stars.",69028,4
69030,It help relief my arch and heel pain.,69030,4
69030,Before using this arch support I am in so much pain for standing and walking 10 hours working shift.,69030,4

69031,"Not as satisfied this time, they appeared to have been stored in a way that caused one of them to be a bit distorted.",69031,4
69032,Purchased the bracelet in support of my mom who has stage 4 brain cancer.,69032,4
69032,Love the bracelet just wish it was adjustable as I have a small wrist and it is big on me but that's not Gina stop me from wearing it.,69032,4
69033,"They're adorable, for sure!",69033,4
69033,"They fit a little snug around our daughter's legs, but we think for your average baby they'll fit just right (our daughter is big for her age).",69033,4
69035,"Runs a little small, should have gotten a size larger.",69035,4
69035,He will outgrow this quickly.,69035,4
69036,Could not ask for a nicer pair of diamond earrings for my daughter.,69036,4
69036,She just turned 21 years old and did not want to spend a bunch of money for her 1st pair (she is in college).,69036,4
69036,In both pair there was a spec of black (coal) which for the money the clarity was surprising stunning.,69036,4
69036,Way to go Amazon!,69036,4
69037,I love this top!,69037,4
69037,It fits true to size.,69037,4

69037,It looked better with the pencil skirt.,69037,4
69037,"Only one issue I have with it is, its shorter than I expected.",69037,4
69037,This can't be worn with a low waist jeans.,69037,4
69037,This is mostly a skirt/ pencil skirt top which you could dress up or dress down.,69037,4
69038,"I'm concerned that once it's washed according to the care directions, it will be too snug.",69038,4
69038,"If it shrinks, then I would recommend buying the next larger size.",69038,4
69038,I'll let ya know.,69038,4
69039,I really loved this item.,69039,4
69039,The colour was fantastic and the panels were flirty in all the right ways.,69039,4
69039,"I was between sizes according to the manufacturer, so I followed the suggestions of several reviewers to size down for support.",69039,4
69039,"Unfortunately, the result was that my 36C bust was falling out!",69039,4
69039,"No matter what I did to adjust the shoulders, I could not get the girls to sit in the cups.",69039,4
69039,I returned and will be ordering the next size up.,69039,4

69042,i like that outfits but one  piece was torn,69042,4
69043,"Bought this for my wife who is pregnant with triplets, the material is soft and stretchy.",69043,4
69043,When I first got it out of the package I thought there was no way it would fit her.,69043,4
69043,"But it fits really well, and she seems to really like it.",69043,4
69044,They arrived when expected.,69044,4
69044,They were made of good quality rubber and fit as stated.,69044,4
69044,My foot has a different size than the other - so order the next size up.,69044,4
69044,They give you inserts to help if they are a bit too big.,69044,4
69046,The earrings are very lovely.,69046,4
69046,They were just a bit heavy for my earlobes so I took the larger glass bead off the bottom....perfect.,69046,4
69047,Wish the waist band were a little stronger or wider.,69047,4
69047,I think they were recommended to be ordered a size up due to the Asian sizing.,69047,4
69047,I'm at the largest end of the small size in US sizing and sometimes it's really true to go a size up.,69047,4
69047,"But, in this case, compared small and medium and found the small to fit better.",69047,4
69047,"Breath nice, don't stay damp long after being wet, give good support.",69047,4
69047,"Expect a little ""wedgy"" feeling out back.... but not overly invasive like a full on thong.",69047,4
69047,Just enough to keep the contours of the cheeks.,69047,4
69047,One nice thing is the loser leg holes which otherwise would tend to ride up and bunch on the boxer style like this.,69047,4
69047,Could probably pass as swim trunks in a pinch.,69047,4
69047,A nice feature if you live where it gets really hot and impromptu trips to a local swimming hole arise now and again.,69047,4
69047,Found a 7 pack by this seller for a better price.,69047,4
69047,"These are made by WangJiang, which offers MANY style of underwear.",69047,4
69048,"The stone is not as red as it is shown, but people have remarked that that is good for contrast with the peacock.",69048,4
69049,I LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS ON ME WISH IT WAS A LITTLE THICKER BUT I WILL BUY ANOTHER AFTER MY NEW ONE HAD IT'S USE.,69049,4
69050,"I really like this shirt overall, but there are a couple of things that bother me.",69050,4
69050,"First, it wrinkles very easily.",69050,4
69050,"I'm afraid to iron it, as it doesn't have a tag, so I don't know what it's made of or the care instructions.",69050,4
69050,"I used a steamer to get the wrinkles out, and that worked ok.  Also, I didn't like the connection above the V (not sure what to call that).",69050,4
69050,"It felt very constricting, and I thought it just looked plain silly.",69050,4
69050,"So I cut it off, and it looks so much better.",69050,4
69050,"Doing this did make the neckline a little looser, but nothing too revealing.",69050,4
69051,I was pleasantly surprised by the style and quality of this sweater for the price.,69051,4
69051,I normally wear an XL but ordered an XXL based on some other reviews.,69051,4
69051,"However, that was way too big for me and I returned for an XL, which fits perfectly.",69051,4
69051,"(Actually, I replaced it with two XLs in different colors!)",69051,4
69051,The style is quite pretty with the stitching detail and kind of a peplum in the back.,69051,4
69051,It a somewhat loose knit that allows the color of the garment you're wearing underneath to show through.,69051,4
69052,"Its cute, my breast is 42D so its alil heavy for da bikin top but still looks good on.",69052,4
69052,The button rides down alil because of the size of my butt but its still wearable.,69052,4
69052,Might fit someone with smaller boobs and not an enormous ass.,69052,4
69052,Gonna wear with a cute cover-up,69052,4
69053,it is not very comfortable unless you wear it with fabric under it.,69053,4
69054,"ok , good for driving, but not very warm.",69054,4
69055,I LOVE this skirt.,69055,4
69055,I am a size 6/8.,69055,4
69055,6 if it is an open bottom and 8 if it is a pencil skirt.,69055,4
69055,My thing is that I have very wide hips/butt but a small waist... so I ordered a large.,69055,4
69055,It fits great through the hips but I will have to get it altered at the waist about an inch to have it tailored to my hourglass shape.,69055,4
69055,The quality is wonderful due to the thick fabric and vibrancy of the red.,69055,4
69055,I would love to order more of these and hope that they start making solid colors as well!,69055,4
69055,"Perfect for the office, night out, or even a casual day with cute flats!",69055,4
69056,They are small but nice,69056,4
69057,"The main part is made out of a sort of knitted cloth, and the stone is plastic.",69057,4
69058,"Super adorable, but tight across the chest.",69058,4
69058,"I immediately popped the seams at the top of the intersection between the stripes and harness, and had to reinforce them with needle and thread.",69058,4
69058,"Still giving four stars though, because I wear a DD and this happens to me a lot.",69058,4
69058,"The suit underneath the skirt is supportive and durable, and smooths out the tummy and back.",69058,4
69058,The skirt flows out just enough to hide any lumps.,69058,4
69059,Amazing dress for great price!,69059,4
69060,Not as pictured but BETTER!,69060,4
69060,No mittens included in my package either.,69060,4
69060,"Love the versatility with non-itch, soft and smooth clothing fabric; little cottontail ball and Double-lined hood was long enough to stay on my Bb's head as he ran around so the panda face and ears were set perfectly where you can see the face facing straight forward while Bb's face in the shadow- pj's, Costume, outerwear any day outfit.",69060,4
69060,Keeps Bb warm and snug in cold weather.,69060,4
69060,Got really good year long use for my then 1 yr old.,69060,4
69060,Would've given 5* considering the mix-up could've been worse than expected.,69060,4
69060,Thanks for the surprise!,69060,4
69060,ill find better pics with it on my Bb,69060,4
69061,these are light weight but I now actually prefer them to something bulky,69061,4
69062,"The name is misleading, these are not Aviators.",69062,4
69062,They are the Erika by RayBan.,69062,4
69062,Great sunglasses and fast shipping!,69062,4
69062,Comes with case and cloth and all.,69062,4
69063,Lightweight oh so comfortable!,69063,4
69065,This tee is the right fit.,69065,4
69065,"I bought 3 different colors, nice slim fit",69065,4
69067,"I read the reviews and got the extra large, I wanted it loose fitting to wear with a wide belt on my hips.",69067,4
69067,"The fabric is not a cotton/linen but a polyester blend, which is fine, but not as advertised, which is why I gave it 4 stars.",69067,4
69067,The style of the dress is great and very versatile - can't beat the price.,69067,4
69067,Would like other colors to choose from!!,69067,4
69068,"more of a durag and the print is too high, but other than that its pretty nice",69068,4
69069,Pretty for an I expensive pendant.,69069,4
69069,Daughter likes it a lot!,69069,4
69070,I like it but it is so light that the back hem kind of flips up and doesn't hang properly.,69070,4
69070,Other than that it is very nice.,69070,4
69071,I'm very happy with this dress.,69071,4
69072,"Really cute, great colors, a big small",69072,4
69073,Nice little gift for three best friends,69073,4
69074,Great material and dye.,69074,4
69074,Just a bit short,69074,4
69076,Threading can become stripped.,69076,4
69077,Feels and looks great,69077,4
69078,I'm pleased with the orthotic & have it in my athletic shoes.,69078,4
69078,"I can feel the difference in walking, but I believe they would even be better in shoes with a deeper heel cup.",69078,4
69079,"Gave as a gift, my wife liked it.",69079,4
69080,Too large and look cheap,69080,4
69082,liked it a lot,69082,4
69083,They only sent me one ring (I ordered two sets) but otherwise I really like.,69083,4
69084,Amazing fit and look.,69084,4
69084,Only drawback is they are easily wrinkled.,69084,4
69084,"Solution is to add extra water to them after wash,  smooth out wrinkles,  fold,  then throw them in the dryer facing their tumbling direction.",69084,4
69084,"It's an annoying process,  but they are easily my favorite pants.",69084,4
69085,Strong and durable to maintain your watch strap in place.,69085,4
69086,Yep/ runs small so plan accordingly!,69086,4
69086,Thin/ yep but still looks awesome!,69086,4
69087,"Fit a little tight, but seem ok. Have not washed yet.",69087,4
69088,"overall, this is a great product!",69088,4
69088,"it was set to arrive in seven days, but it came after only three!",69088,4
69088,i believe i ordered a size up bc i feel like p much everything online runs small.. and the sweater has a wonderful fit.,69088,4
69088,"the only problem i have is that as you can see in the picture, the shoulders are loose before the sleeve seems to become tighter; this is definitely the case.",69088,4
69088,"it fits fine around the shoulders, and then from my wrists to halfway past my elbow the sleeves are weirdly tight.",69088,4
69088,"had i ordered another size up i believe the rest of the sweater would have looked too baggy, so i'm still glad i chose the size i did.",69088,4
69088,"((i'm sixteen, 5'3'' and weight i think ~130lbs.",69088,4
69088,i usually get a medium but i ordered a large)) also in retrospect i'm not sure why i ordered a sweater covered in rhinestones.,69088,4
69088,"they look cute, but be aware those are definitely rhinestones.",69088,4
69089,Really liked this shoe but it was too small.,69089,4
69090,My girlfriend looks great in this.,69090,4
69090,It is very sexy and fits well.,69090,4
69090,She is 5' 6 and about 130 lbs.,69090,4
69092,Thank god there's something besides cargo shorts out there,69092,4
69093,"Great product for the money but watch the heals, they can roll up on you if you slide your foot in wrong.",69093,4
69093,Light weight and non-skid and great for playing,69093,4
69094,I like it heaver than i thought.,69094,4
69094,But I don't think the clasp is strong enough for the size of the chain,69094,4
69095,Top was quite small but bottom fit well.,69095,4
69096,"This top is cute, beautiful colorful yellow but for a much smaller person then me.",69096,4
69096,I have large breasts they were having a hard time fitting in this top.,69096,4
69096,"Please do not get me wrong, it's very sexy top.",69096,4
69096,I could wear in public but I chose not to.,69096,4
69096,I would buy again with a larger size.,69096,4
69098,"Pros:
-The quality was much better than expected.",69098,4
69098,"-The corset back is wonderful, you do not need size alterations.",69098,4
69098,"These pictures were taken withou a bustle and with self-lacing, for an event you would absolutely need someone to lace you up.",69098,4
69098,"Cons:
-lace appliqu at the top has visible seams, you can see them in one of my pictures.",69098,4
69098,With careful cutting I am confident I can clean this up.,69098,4
69098,I think the dress would have looked cleaner without this part.,69098,4
69098,I haven't seen any other instances of weird seems.,69098,4
69098,-Shoulders are a little tight.,69098,4
69098,"I recommend sizing up

Considering the price, I rate this 4 stars.",69098,4
69098,"I was going to return it because of the lop lace, but have decided to keep it as a backup.",69098,4
69099,Great product just fits small order a size up for sure!,69099,4
69100,"This top fits well, and it's a great color.",69100,4
69100,It's made of polyester which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.,69100,4
69101,the inseam seems to be a bit longer than past purchases.,69101,4
69102,I like this necklace.,69102,4
69102,The only downside for me is it can be quite loud (clinking) when moving around.,69102,4
69102,"I like the long length -  goes to about my belly button, but I am short.",69102,4
69103,I like it but it does get snagged in my hair a bit.,69103,4
69104,"I've had these for a few months and I still like them, however, the threads at the seams have started to come apart.",69104,4
69104,I really love the length of these though so I will likely buy again,69104,4
69105,heel is a lil offset but very comfortable,69105,4
69106,"While the fit is somewhat small, and the shirt is mostly see through, I still like it",69106,4
69107,Nice colors great delivery fits too small but should be able to use soon,69107,4
69109,Bought as a gift for my 19 year old daughter.,69109,4
69110,Was for a gift and its like photo,69110,4
69111,they are pretty good.,69111,4
69111,used to cost half the price and be shipped from china,69111,4
69112,"Top too small and not designed for anything bigger than B covers only the front and fits awkward, bottom ok, pretty and material is ok",69112,4
69114,"Not a bad shirt
Fits well
Looks good",69114,4
69115,Very study and well built.,69115,4
69115,Matching wallet had one missing gem but I don't use it right now anyways and when I do use it I will just go to the craft store and get a gem to put on it.,69115,4
69116,great shirts fit fine and good quality,69116,4
69117,Didn't realize the size came that small.,69117,4
69118,This dress is adorable on!,69118,4
69118,I bought a belt to accent a high waist.,69118,4
69118,It is see through though.,69118,4
69118,I'd suggest leggings and a tube top to layer underneath.,69118,4
69119,"Super cute dress, runs very small.",69119,4
69120,The top was a but loose and the bottem very small but it was still very good and when i requested to return they were very nice and helpful,69120,4
69121,Food for the price.,69121,4
69121,"When i just got was good shining just like the picture, but i made a mistake i put it in water and color turned to dark green.",69121,4
69122,It fits fantastic and looks great but the material that hangs down from is more see through than the picture leads on.,69122,4
69123,Exactly what I was looking for.,69123,4
69123,My niece loved it.,69123,4
69124,"Top fits well, bottom is a little snug but acceptable.",69124,4
69124,I'd buy again in another color.,69124,4
69125,"I love, love these jockstraps.",69125,4
69125,They're one of the many I've ordered that actually fits vey well.,69125,4
69125,The band strap is thick and grips on tight enough to not shift around as much.,69125,4
69125,"Because of that, and the design of the semi-cutout of the back, it helps give the illusion of a bigger, rounder bubble bottom.",69125,4
69125,"The tops love it, and love gripping the waist band strap while he does the deed.",69125,4
69125,Turns them all on immensely.,69125,4
69125,"Only thing is, it seems the material, the fine mesh, gets scruffed up easily and you can see the fine fibers come undone.",69125,4
69125,Would definitely recommend handwashing if possible.,69125,4
69126,Was prettier than I thought.,69126,4
69127,Bought these for my man.,69127,4
69127,They are a bit small around the junk area but that can be seen as a positive thing too ;),69127,4
69128,I really loved my first wallet.,69128,4
69128,This one seems a little different.,69128,4
69128,It doesn't close 100% even.,69128,4
69128,I am slightly nervous it may not last as long.,69128,4
69128,But i still love the item itself.,69128,4
69129,"The front pocket is a little weird...it's wider than it is deep, and has these two flaps of fabric like a little junk corral on the sides, but they are good at corralling and holding everything in place while still being comfy!",69129,4
69130,"Work well, looks nice.",69130,4
69130,"Different material than I expected, so it gets difficult to pull them up when you're sweaty from your workout.",69130,4
69130,Still does the job!,69130,4
69130,"Length was perfect and I am 5'6"".",69130,4
69131,"I got Pattern 14, the first one.",69131,4
69131,Looks brighter in person than it does on the model.,69131,4
69131,More so like the other pictures featured.,69131,4
69132,"like this and the color, comfortable to wear",69132,4
69133,"I just received my order today, just in time for Mother's Day and I'm slightly disappointed in my purchase.",69133,4
69133,"I wanted the gold heart on my necklace to say Mom, as it is pictured..",69133,4
69133,"Granted, she is now one, being a Mother's Day gift, I really wanted the Mom charm.. My card was also ripped and the necklace was not in place, so now I have to go through the trouble of putting it in something else and giving her something I'm not 100% satisfied with, and purchasing a new card.",69133,4
69133,I'm still rating this a 4 though because the necklace being the main piece is nicely made.. Just not worth the $50 as a gift packaging and incorrect charms.,69133,4
69134,"Nice cap at a great price, but seems to run slightly narrow.",69134,4
69135,Product is of quality i expected.,69135,4
69136,"This is a small, but I don't think it fits any baby less than 6 to 8 months old.",69136,4
69136,Other than that it is a great onesie.,69136,4
69136,The colors are vivid and the material seems very nice and well made.,69136,4
69136,"I bought it for my 3 month old, but it will be a while until he is able to wear it.",69136,4
69137,I loved the feel and fit.,69137,4
69137,The only down side was that it was not true red -it was more tomato color.,69137,4
69137,I returned it for another option that was more red for a Daniel Tiger Halloween costume for my 3 year old.,69137,4
69138,"I""m 5'-3, 140lbs, 36D chest.",69138,4
69138,Shirt is loose fitting.,69138,4
69138,"Material is very soft, wrinkle free.",69138,4
69139,"I would almost say they're closer to teal than Jade Green, but it's not too far off and still a beautiful color.",69139,4
69140,"Fits well, comfortable, good for lounging or sleeping",69140,4
69141,Super cute but too small.,69141,4
69142,I got mine in the mail last week.,69142,4
69142,I've worn them once and I like them for the price.,69142,4
69142,They are definitely comfortable and would be good for lounging around or working out.,69142,4
69142,I wore them to work with a longer top.,69142,4
69142,I asked my teenage if they were see through because sometimes they can be if they are thin but she told me they weren't.,69142,4
69142,I see her wearing leggings all the time.,69142,4
69142,I guess everyone is into the legging craze right now.,69142,4
69142,I like that these are Capri length although I'm short they come above my ankles.,69142,4
69142,I bought 1 pair black in the larger size and one patterned pair in the smaller of these.,69142,4
69142,I think I'll give the smaller one to my daughter..based on the fit I'm sticking with the larger ones.,69142,4
69142,She hasn't worn them yet but liked the pattern.,69142,4
69142,It was the black n white ones with the elephant.,69142,4
69142,Hope you enjoy your purchase!,69142,4
69143,I liked these shoes a lot.,69143,4
69143,I didn't give a 5 because the color was a little lighter than I thought it was going to be but still a great shoe.,69143,4
69144,very comfortable but too long and too big.,69144,4
69144,It's a nice pants during pregnancy,69144,4
69145,The top is beautiful but I wished it came in sizes.,69145,4
69145,"I'm 122lbs 5'4"" wear small.",69145,4
69145,This top is large on me.,69145,4
69146,"I'm 5' 8"" and the are plenty long.",69146,4
69146,I would give them 5 stars off they didn't catch pilings so easily.,69146,4
69146,"I bought a defuzzer to address that and it adequately takes care of the problem, it's just annoying to have that concern.",69146,4
69148,Nice looking pair of jeans!!,69148,4
69148,You gotta try Um!!!!,69148,4

69150,Order up a size.,69150,4
69151,It is a little small.,69151,4
69151,I love the design and the cutouts on the bottoms.,69151,4
69152,This is a present for someone else but I was happy with the color.,69152,4
69152,"It did take a long time to arrive, but I'm glad it's here.",69152,4
69153,Great buy and was a comfort fit!,69153,4

69154,For the price you can't beat it,69154,4
69155,"Good quality for price, too big for my septum piercing though, it hangs down too low.",69155,4
69155,I will be purchasing the 8mm next to see if that works.,69155,4

69164,Waistband on long pants is a little bit big on my 26 month old daughter.,69164,4
69164,The pants sag but not so much they will fall down.,69164,4
69164,This doesn't bother me because there's room for her to grow.,69164,4
69164,Shorts have more stretch to them and don't have this problem.,69164,4
69164,She's 35 inches tall and weighs 28 lbs.,69164,4
69165,I wish it wasn't as small but overall I like it,69165,4

69170,runs on the small side but other wise I love it.,69170,4
69171,sexy a bit low from the waistline but I like them.,69171,4
69172,"Cute, but barely fit my 5 year old granddaughter.",69172,4
69172,"She is petite, but this is more for a toddler not a girls size.",69172,4
69173,Very sturdy chain and pendant with great color and clarity.,69173,4
69173,I really like this as a fun every day neclace.,69173,4
69174,"Sarong for Cancun, I was ""Sexy"" and my pictures were Beautiful because the suit is very colorful.",69174,4
69175,Great sweater for the new film!,69175,4
69176,This is absolutely a beautiful piece of jewelry.,69176,4
69176,My only problem is that it is light weight and moves around on my neck a bit.,69176,4
69176,One of my colleagues was very positive about that and said that it represented birds flying.,69176,4
69176,It is really lovely.,69176,4
69176,I wish it was just a little bit heavier.,69176,4
69176,"The birds symbolize my mother and me, so that's all that matter.",69176,4
69176,"The quality is excellent, and I do love it very much!",69176,4
69176,Update:  The birds are beautiful.,69176,4
69176,"I do wish that the chain was a bit heavier, but one thing I noticed (not previously) is that the chain has an extender piece!",69176,4
69176,"At this length, the birds stay centered and in place.",69176,4
69176,I love it dearly as I did my mom.,69176,4
69177,"Like it but it's really big, I'll have to take it in on the sides by an inch.",69177,4
69177,But the dress is cute.,69177,4
69178,I really love these crop leggings.,69178,4
69178,"My only complaint is that the leggings begin to ""ride up"" my legs after a few hours wear, which, then, forces me to tug at them to pull them back down continuously from that point on.",69178,4
69178,"Not sure why that happens, but it's the only flaw I have found in these otherwise fantastic leggings.",69178,4
69179,"I haven't worn it yet, but looking forward to it.",69179,4
69180,This dress is beautiful.,69180,4

69180,It fits me perfectly.,69180,4
69180,"When I first tried it on, I thought it might be too tight- however a quick look in the mirror proved otherwise.",69180,4
69180,The colors in the dress are vibrant and the pattern is beautiful.,69180,4
69180,"I really like how it is not as fancy as I had originally thought (the skirt is not quite as full), so I can get more use out of it on a regular basis.",69180,4
69180,"I am giving four stars instead of five stars because of the collar- it stinks up in a funny manner, and I am going to have to sew it.",69180,4
69180,I recommend this dress to anyone looking for a beautiful piece of clothing.,69180,4
69181,"Super comfy, fit great!",69181,4

69182,She is a girls large and we ordered a Women's medium,69182,4
69183,I Use these as loungewear,69183,4
69186,"Have tried them on, and they fit as expected.",69186,4
69186,"Wife didn't care for the brightness of the colors, but I bought them to shock some persons at work.",69186,4
69187,"I am 6'2 and wear 34 length pants, so my legs are somewhat long.",69187,4
69187,It is a hassle to find shorts that even reach my knees.,69187,4
69187,"With that said, I can't be mad that these are a bit short for my taste.",69187,4
69187,The material is nice and I would be all over these things if there was a tall sizing available.,69187,4
69188,It's a very pretty red.,69188,4
69188,Seems to be nice leather and holds plenty of cards but the change falls out every time you open it.,69188,4
69188,I don't know if the blocking aspect works or not.,69188,4
69188,How does one check on that.,69188,4
69188,Nice size but because of the change falling out I gave it 4 stars.,69188,4
69189,Cute dress for prom!,69189,4
69189,I ordered thinking it could possibly be used as a wedding dress but it is was not what I was looking for!,69189,4
69190,They great for every day wear,69190,4
69191,Perfect for my little guy...,69191,4
69192,great option for busy city streets with light rain (I use the full size adult version for torrential downpours) when you don't want to carry a full size model around all day,69192,4
69193,Shoes seemed to fit well but the opening is very wide.,69193,4
69193,This did not work for us.,69193,4
69193,We are hoping they will fit better next summer.,69193,4
69194,It was bit large but not too large.,69194,4
69194,"I am keeping it, don't if I will be wearing it.",69194,4
69195,"A bit low cut, but that is personal taste.",69195,4
69196,Looks n feel very classy,69196,4
69197,"Fits well, and well made",69197,4

69198,I usually wear a size 12/14 in women's clothing.,69198,4

69198,"Keep in mind that I am only 5 ft tall, and this dress hit above my knee.",69198,4
69198,"The material is thin, but not too thin.",69198,4
69198,My only complaints are that the material shows lines from your undergarments and that the dress came very wrinkled.,69198,4
69198,"I attempted to iron it, but the material is really not meant for that and it the wrinkles just became deeper.",69198,4
69198,I think that this dress will lose the wrinkles slowly as it hangs in my closet.,69198,4
69198,"Overall this is an adorable little dress, very comfortable, and a great price.",69198,4
69200,This was a great to wear when we went out after our wedding!,69200,4
69200,The shirt doesn't have much give like a Polly blend shirt would.,69200,4
69201,But would rather pay the mall a trip and get sized.,69201,4
69202,Hope it doesn't shrink in the wash.,69202,4
69202,"It arrived too late for the event I was going to wear it for, so I'll save it for later",69202,4
69204,This was cute and comfortable as I expected.,69204,4
69204,I ended up returning because I got a few different items to try and went with another.,69204,4
69204,"Mainly the only reason was that the circle in the center really drew attention to that area and I found it a bit distracting, personally.",69204,4
69205,Nothing to hold in place.,69205,4
69205,"Cute and stretchy, for all purposes.",69205,4
69206,ordered a large but the seller refunded 30% no return needed.,69206,4
69207,I'm using them for a costume and possible daily wear and they are suitable,69207,4
69208,When I first got it in the mail I was surprised and glad that it's shipped !,69208,4
69208,When I got the necklace I put it in a gift box and send it to my mom for a gift and she said it was nice to wear it in the day because it sparkles,69208,4
69209,It was for my little sister's homecoming.,69209,4
69209,"She likes it, but I expected it to be a little more stiff I guess.",69209,4
69211,I always seem to be missing a collar stay.,69211,4
69211,"Works really well and provides a good means to recycle old discount cards, credit cards, etc.",69211,4
69212,I think it's a beautiful shirt.,69212,4
69212,"I ordered a M, which was a bit small on me.",69212,4
69212,I suggest if your on the bigger breasts area order like a large on this shirt.,69212,4
69212,"I am 36C, 142lbs, 5'4'.",69212,4
69212,Other then that the shirt i's great!,69212,4
69214,"I started wearing these about a week and a half after my c-section, they are far more comfortable than the binder my doctor had me in and offered support in areas the binder could not reach.",69214,4
69214,"I would have liked a little more support/compression over my stomach, but they provided great support and comfort over my incision.",69214,4
69214,The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star review is because they are hand wash/line dry - after having surgery and a baby I want something easy to wash/dry.,69214,4
69215,I am a 32b cup and I wear small to medium underwear.,69215,4
69215,The top doesnt adjust around the waist portion but the small size fit me ok.,69215,4
69215,The bottoms I wish came bigger.,69215,4
69215,I got them on but they are obviously to small because my buttcheeks spill outthe sides lol.,69215,4
69215,"I shoukd have ordered a medium or large, but then im afraid the tip would be to big.",69215,4
69215,The lace is very pretty and it looks very sexy.,69215,4

69215,Even though the bottoms are small i still love it.,69215,4
69217,I loves these !,69217,4
69217,I have worn them almost every day since I got them.,69217,4
69217,They look like the real things !,69217,4
69217,They feel a little fragile but not cheap so I am just very careful with them.,69217,4
69217,But they look great on.,69217,4
69218,I loved this shirt until the bottom two seams on the ruffled bottom came undone.,69218,4
69218,"I did remove the rest of the thread and it seemed to be ok, but I wasn't thrilled that it came undone.",69218,4
69218,"But, for the price, I won't complain.",69218,4
69219,Somewhat limited on how much you can carry.,69219,4
69221,Came just as expected very nice scarf especially for how inexpensive it was,69221,4
69222,I like VfEmage dresses.,69222,4
69222,They are a good fit for me and typically have a sexy style.,69222,4
69222,The fabrics are nice also.,69222,4
69222,They run small though.,69222,4
69222,I typically wear size 10 or 12.,69222,4
69222,"In this brand, I buy 14 or 16.",69222,4
69223,It works as advertised.,69223,4
69223,Much better than leaving my watch on the window sill.,69223,4
69224,I liked it but returned it because I ordered a different costume.,69224,4
69224,Never wore this one.,69224,4
69225,Very pretty and dainty.,69225,4
69225,Would not recommend for large wrist.,69225,4
69225,Perfect gift for a tween!,69225,4
69226,The XS/S fit much snigger than I thought it would be but the S/M is too big.,69226,4
69226,Other than the size they are great hats and durable.,69226,4
69227,Fits just right ppl who left reviews guided me in the right direction.,69227,4
69227,I am 5 ft tall about 120 to 125 pounds I got a Medium.,69227,4
69227,Fits great and the straps are great!!!,69227,4
69228,"The hat is nice, not real flimsy.",69228,4
69228,But it is HUGE!,69228,4
69228,Definitely not a women's hat and was even big on my husband who normally wears a size large hat.,69228,4
69228,Not sure if I got a different hat than some of the reviewers but this straw hat with the black band was way too big.,69228,4
69229,Still a little bit for my two month old but looks cute when she can keep it on her head.,69229,4
69229,Nicely packaged as well!,69229,4
69230,I am findin this very useful after a week of using it.,69230,4
69230,It has helped me keep my maternity clothes up as I am only 17 weeks now and I have been able to wear my shorts longer.,69230,4
69230,I did find that it fit a bit larger than I expected.,69230,4
69231,Grand daughter loved em,69231,4
69232,"Great for the price, wish it could ship without crushing top of hat down.",69232,4
69234,"Looks cute, but not what I was expecting",69234,4
69236,Very tight around the arms.,69236,4
69236,Otherwise it's a wonderful shirt,69236,4
69237,"So far, I love it.",69237,4
69238,I was very happy with the purchase I made through Amazon?,69238,4
69238,The pajama set fit my grandson perfectly and it arrived just when they promised in good shape!,69238,4
69238,I would definitely recommend the product to others?,69238,4
69239,"These nose rings are the first change for me since my piercing, so keep that in mind with my review.",69239,4
69239,I paid $80 for the post I got my nose pierced with because I wanted to have a back on it.,69239,4
69239,"I couldn't believe that most places pierced with no backs so you had to hold your nose ring in showering, coughing etc, or it would blow out!",69239,4
69239,"These nose rings are a great value because they do have a flat head on the end so it won't be falling out, so that is a bonus!",69239,4
69239,They are not cheaply made at all.,69239,4
69239,I have the silver one in now and will wear the black with my Harley gear this summer.,69239,4
69239,"I do think these are little thicker than the post I had in and a little bigger than I thought they would be, but I have nothing to compare that to as I went from a stud to these rings.",69239,4
69239,"I have very sensitive skin so was afraid they would bother me and I haven't had an issue with them at all, yeah!",69239,4
69239,"If that changes I will update my review and let you know, but I think it would have happened by now.",69239,4
69239,Great value and quality.,69239,4
69239,Product was supplied at a discount to use for the purpose of this review.,69239,4
69239,"This is also, the reason there may not be a ""Verified Purchase"" on this review.",69239,4

69243,"The only thing is, I wish it had a more secure closing",69243,4
69244,This was a fun dress.,69244,4
69244,It kind of falls apart and fits a little small but for a one knight it's okay.,69244,4
69245,Item was perfect for my daughter!,69245,4
69246,Fabric somewhat light but still a very nice shirt.,69246,4
69247,the finished product might not be that smooth as shown in the picture.,69247,4
69247,But it was really cool.,69247,4
69248,"I like this dress but don't love it, I'm 5'6"" and 115 lbs.",69248,4
69248,It is a little long on me but fine with a slight wedge.,69248,4
69248,I like that I can wear a bra with it.,69248,4
69248,"It is pretty casual, the print at the top is not vibrant but more faded looking and a thin material.",69248,4
69249,"My daughter ordered this, she loves it, gets many compliments on it.",69249,4
69249,"She has to wear a ""stick-on bra"" with it cuz there's not a lot of options for bras with this (mama insists she wear one) but it is very cute.",69249,4
69250,Bought to wear to high school reunion and it fit perfect,69250,4
69251,They could have made it a bit sturdier,69251,4
69252,"These seem like a good product, although I've had complaints about Hanes before...thin  material, shrunk when washed, so we shall see.",69252,4
69253,"I really love this shirt, it is too bad it fits smaller than I expected.",69253,4
69254,"After reading the reviews, I decided to order 2 sizes up from my normal size (usually wear a small & ordered a large) & it was still a little bit too small.",69254,4
69254,I think an xl would've fit much better.,69254,4
69254,I have a pretty short torso & it was still a little too short for me.,69254,4
69254,The top doesn't fit much chest either & I'd be afraid of falling out with any kind of real movement.,69254,4
69254,It might fit better if I stretch it out some tho.,69254,4
69254,"I was disappointed bc I had planned on taking it on vacation soon, but don't have enough time to exchange since it took a month to get in.",69254,4
69254,"It's a cute swimsuit & pretty good quality, so I'm just going to give it to my sister since she's smaller than me.",69254,4
69255,"Not guide as pretty as the picture, but a nice scarf regardless.",69255,4
69256,I really love this dress.,69256,4
69256,"It has a nice slightly caped design element on the back, which I like.",69256,4
69256,The front is shorter then the back.,69256,4
69256,"I'm 5'2"" and the dress is fairly short on me-- mid thigh in the front.",69256,4
69258,"I like it very much, thank you.",69258,4
69259,Only reason that it's 4 stars opposed to 5 is because we just got it.,69259,4
69259,Immediately packed our martial art supplies and uniform in it.,69259,4
69259,Loving the light material.,69259,4
69259,It makes carrying and transporting our stuff so much lighter and easier.,69259,4
69259,"The bag is malleable, too.",69259,4
69259,Not stiff like the last one we were using.,69259,4
69259,I kind of wish that it had more pockets but pretty satisfied overall with the pockets it does have.,69259,4
69260,"Cotton is heavier weight, shirt is a bit on the large side of large.",69260,4
69262,Good quality for the price!,69262,4
69263,"I really liked this bathing suit, but i HAVE big breasts, so it was small for me.",69263,4
69263,"I wished I ordered a bigger size, but didn't know it was going to be small :(",69263,4
69264,My expectation was met everything about it was just great.,69264,4
69265,"I love it good fit quick shipping I'm a plus size girl in i got 3x only thing is I'm short, 5""4 pants are a little to long but its still cute love it .",69265,4
69266,These leggings are true to size and showed up fast!,69266,4
69266,"The print is exactly as pictured and they are opaque (they are leggings, not tights).",69266,4
69266,If you're looking for some comfortable leggings to show off your Scottish pride - or otherwise just want tartan leggings - these are great!,69266,4
69267,They are what they are.....You get what you pay for,69267,4
69268,"The green is a dark, forest green.",69268,4
69268,The fit is near perfect; the seam under the bust tends to ride a smidge high for me even though I'm not a busty girl.,69268,4
69268,"The material is heavy, so you don't worry about being back lit, walking in the rain, or having a Marilyn moment.",69268,4
69268,"It's conservative enough for work, but stylish enough I'd wear it for a night out.",69268,4
69269,"Decent shirt, Not as lightweight and different texture than UnderArmour but would recommend for the price.",69269,4
69270,"The mustache pajamas are adorable, and my 4-year old son loves them.",69270,4
69270,He wanted pjs with mustaches and footies so they fit the bill.,69270,4
69270,The size bought was 5T.,69270,4
69270,"The tight fit actually posed a problem for us, as they are a little too small for him.",69270,4
69270,"After washing, we can hardly zip them.",69270,4
69270,"He is a thin 4 year old, but he is tall.",69270,4
69270,The pajamas are not fitting around his shoulders well any longer (after 2 washes).,69270,4
69271,"The dress looked just like the picture, so I was impressed.",69271,4
69271,I figured it would run small and so I purchased an XL (usually a large in most tops) and it fit as I expected.,69271,4
69271,Just know to go up a size.,69271,4
69272,Feels like I am not wearing a bra.,69272,4
69272,But I don't hate it.,69272,4
69272,Zero lining or support.,69272,4
69273,Wife wanted robe that zipped in the front.,69273,4
69273,Exactly what she wanted.,69273,4
69274,"like it, a small was too loose on me.",69274,4
69276,"Great buy , i got a lot of duplicates though.",69276,4
69276,"I got 102 rings , shipping was also fast.",69276,4
69278,"Fit is good, material good, color good, front pocket is super weird though",69278,4
69279,It is excellent as a costume prop for the costume.,69279,4
69279,I would not recommend letting the kids actually play fight with the light saber though because it is not strong enough and actually did pop out when they were play fighting.,69279,4
69279,It is pretty easy to pop back into place though after.,69279,4
69280,They were somewhat a little smaller/tighter then expected.,69280,4
69280,But overall my son loves them and are great cleats!,69280,4
69280,They have stretched out over the last couple weeks and go on easy now!,69280,4
69281,"needed it for a dress for an upcoming event, fast shipping package delivered as advertised.",69281,4
69281,"didn't have a problem with rolling down.. (which is usually the case with these things) fit right, sucked in everything.",69281,4
69281,only problem.. was going to bathroom... (had to take the whole thing down) no biggie still happy with the look and curves it enhanced.,69281,4
69282,"These look and fit great, but as others have said, parts of the owl decal do not stretch and can be somewhat uncomfortable at times.",69282,4
69283,Firm rubber & no rubbing between the toes.,69283,4
69284,The service was super fast and the gloves are very well made.,69284,4
69284,I ordered the small based on the size chart and they fit fine but the fingers are a bit short.,69284,4
69284,That is the only reason they didn't get 5 stars.,69284,4
69284,I do have somewhat long fingers which maybe why.,69284,4
69284,I can still wear them comfortably and they are warm.,69284,4
69284,The inside liner is VERY soft and comfy.,69284,4
69284,I imagine they will last a long time.,69284,4
69284,I love the hand-warmer zip pockets on the top of the gloves.,69284,4
69284,They will be good for holding a house key and a credit card too.,69284,4
69284,I have worn them on my daily walk on -30 degree days and they kept my hands warm.,69284,4
69284,We'll see how they work out when I go snowshoeing in Vermont in February.,69284,4
69284,That will be the test.,69284,4
69285,Cheap materials but cute.,69285,4
69286,Wears nicely and feels soft.,69286,4
69286,I washed it but haven't worn it since.,69286,4
69286,Will update once I wear it again.,69286,4
69286,It requires some serious ironing hints  why I haven't worn it again.,69286,4
69287,Nice top followed size chart somewhat larger than anticipated,69287,4
69288,"Great fit,  medium weight fabric - will use when I exercise in the water - straps look like they won't fall down.",69288,4
69288,It is flattering and not too tight.,69288,4
69289,These are cute but after wearing one for a week straight the very top busted open.,69289,4
69289,I do have a big head and know how to sew so I would definitely buy them again.,69289,4
69290,"Fits well, not too long, very comfortable.",69290,4
69290,Just what I wanted!,69290,4
69291,I like non hanging charms and this one is pretty.,69291,4
69291,"It's a little longer than I would like, but it has a good weight.",69291,4
69291,Not so heavy that you are constantly reminded it's there.,69291,4
69291,Hasn't turned colors and doesn't bother me laying on my stomach.,69291,4
69292,I ordered the S-M 3 pack leggins.,69292,4
69292,I am 5'6 and about 148 lbs.,69292,4
69292,I have a pear shaped body and a larger booty.,69292,4
69292,They were very comfortable but to small as far as the height and gave me the saggy/baggy crotch.,69292,4
69292,I probably should have sized up and that is what I intend to do.,69292,4
69292,Seemed very good as far a quality goes.,69292,4
69292,Will be perfect with my tunics and long flannel shirts with cute boots for winter.,69292,4
69293,"You being have a big butt but i do have a butt and although the small fit everywhere, my butt was hanging out:).",69293,4
69293,Which isn't bad if that's what you're going for but I was wanting a bit more coverage.,69293,4
69293,I bought shorts and it's worked fine!,69293,4
69295,They feel pretty flimsy.,69295,4
69295,But for the price and size that was spot on.,69295,4
69295,I took off a star though because the piece that goes into the labret from the front is very loose and fell off quickly already on my 3rd.,69295,4
69297,Nothing wrong with the dress.,69297,4
69297,"Simple, can be elegant.",69297,4
69297,"Wearing it, my children asked me if I was in a Who wore it better contest with a certain Biblical firgure.",69297,4
69297,Not sure if I wasngoing for that particular look.,69297,4
69297,"Style would probably work better on a somewhat younger, thinner person, even though it does fit well and is loose and comfy.",69297,4
69297,I might have to resew a few seams to ensure they don't disintegrate in the hand wash.,69297,4
69297,Fabric is a shiny gauzy material.,69297,4
69297,Lighter than the linen I had hope for.,69297,4
69298,He will love it his favorite color is green,69298,4
69299,Same as the picture.,69299,4
69300,Super cute but far too big.,69300,4
69301,"I love these socks, I can get them to go up to my thigh but over time they'll start to slip down, so that's why I have it 4 stars.",69301,4
69301,They do have knitting but I was aware of that and don't mind it :) very cute!,69301,4
69303,I have what is considered a small head but have always worn a Medium without a problem....,69303,4
69303,I found this hat to be a bit on the small side and a Large may haven been a better choice.,69303,4
69303,It does fit though snuggly so keep that in mind when ordering.,69303,4
69303,This plaid is a great color.,69303,4
69304,"Doing intense cardio, they sometimes fold over and start to slip off, but with yoga and weight training they are great!",69304,4
69305,Product arrived on time and packaged well.,69305,4
69305,I ordered this thinking maybe I could wear it and work out daily in it.,69305,4
69305,"I was looking to order the mesh waist trainer not for cosmetic look but, to help in keeping me right and together during tough workout sessions.",69305,4
69305,However it was smaller then expected even though I thought I had made sure that I ordered two almost three sizes bigger because of the reviews and statements about it running smaller then expected but it still wasn't true to that either.,69305,4
69305,It did go around my midsection but was smaller length wise then I had anticipated.,69305,4
69305,"I'm sure that with some more weight loss I will be able to wear it and it fit comfortably but, was disappointed I couldn't comfortably wear it now.",69305,4
69305,Just use best judgment when ordering.,69305,4
69305,"Being plus size makes it difficult to order anything online but, it did manage to go around me so I can't complain too much.",69305,4
69305,But I ordered the 4x but it was more like a 14/16 women's size.,69305,4
69305,If that helps any ladies out there.,69305,4
69306,They fit somewhat small.,69306,4
69306,Was expecting better packaging as these came in a zip lock bag type of package,69306,4
69307,Was big for a small,69307,4
69308,Earrings show a deep blue color.,69308,4
69308,"However, when it arrived, it was a light blue color.",69308,4
69308,Does not stand out due to the color.,69308,4
69310,"The vest is adorable, but no way are these adult sizes......I set it aside as a Christmas gift for a 12 year old.....",69310,4
69311,"I like it very much, the color, i doesn't fit me as i expected a little large, but i like it, i doen't prove it at the rain yet.",69311,4
69311,But i will let you know.,69311,4
69312,Top was too small skirt was okay overall great for the price,69312,4
69313,"Ordered a larger one too because this does run small, but as a seamstress, I'll use the smaller one in another way.",69313,4
69314,makes my 6 mile walks more comfortable,69314,4
69315,"Ordered this for my mom, she loves it.",69315,4
69317,i bought an extra size from what i use on pants and i think it isn t necessarry.,69317,4
69317,its a litlle bit to high but ok beacuse i use tankini.,69317,4
69318,And pierced it perfectly !,69318,4
69319,I love how this dress looks but it is too small for the size.,69319,4
69319,It comes from China so am having a difficult time sending it back.,69319,4
69320,These are very small!,69320,4
69320,But light and cute.,69320,4
69320,Wish they were a bit bigger...,69320,4
69321,The lace is lovely.,69321,4
69321,I used several of the suggestions in the comment section.,69321,4
69321,"I ordered a size up, and it is still a little snug in the chest.",69321,4
69321,"I washed it in cold water after letting it soak in cold water and vinegar to set the color, as the color is not set upon receipt.",69321,4
69321,"The bottom edge/train is very long, but has no hem/raw edges so we trimmed it to length.",69321,4
69321,"As long as you don't go in expecting more than you pay for, this is a good option.",69321,4
69322,"good material, its shape is a little awkward but I like it.",69322,4
69324,"Fit nicely, sturdy material.",69324,4
69324,"Love that the button says, ""jeans jeans jeans"".",69324,4
69325,They are warm & keep my feet & lower legs warm.,69325,4
69325,They are loosly knit so they stretch alot.,69325,4
69325,"The picture shows them going over the knee,  but mine come up to slightly below my knees.",69325,4
69326,It came super fast I needed it for a wedding.,69326,4
69326,It matched the picture and was comfy.,69326,4
69326,I don't know why so many people have bad reviews on the product mine came exactly as expected and  wasn't damaged when it arrived.,69326,4
69326,"I orded a medium I'm 5' 3"" and 140 lbs.",69326,4
69326,it wasn't too short as everyone kept saying it would be and in my opinion well worth the money.,69326,4
69327,It shows all your curves but pretty thick fabric you can't see through it especially when you wear black undergarments,69327,4
69328,It's very pretty I love the material it's light and soft.,69328,4
69328,It was not sowed very well my seams started coming undone.. my Daughter things because my boobs are big.,69328,4
69328,but I just sowed them back together.,69328,4
69328,And I have not had any problems since.,69328,4
69329,I wear a M so that's what I wear but this shirt was a size or tow small so if u orderbon just do a size bigger,69329,4
69330,Love the color scheme,69330,4
69331,"i ordered these a little over a month ago, and received 7 of the 8 pairs that come in the set.",69331,4
69331,"I contacted siikworld and informed them about it, and they shipped me the blue pair i was missing, their customer service is just outstanding and awesome, very polite and friendy, as for these briefs, i absolutely love them.",69331,4
69331,"I am a size 32 medium, so i ordered a large, and they fit wonderful.",69331,4
69331,"They are well made, soft feeling, and skin tight, they are very supportive and comfortable with a fully functional 2 button buttonfly.",69331,4
69331,"The back is almost full coverage, you will possibly have some butt cheek hanging out like i do, the front is very very low cut, however, they do stretch in the front just a little.",69331,4
69331,"I would rate these a 5 star, however, due to the very bare minimum of space in the front as you can see in the pictures, they get a 4 star rating.",69331,4
69331,"Over all, i am very pleased with these briefs, and will definitely order more from siikworld in the future.",69331,4
69332,"The cock ring could be a bit tighter  and a little less fabric in the front corset,  however it is super comfy",69332,4
69333,Very pretty my daughter love it.,69333,4
69333,Slighy problem with clasp not staying closed.,69333,4
69334,The dress is a great quality considering the price!,69334,4
69334,I actually really like the design of the top and even the material.,69334,4
69334,The only issue that I have is with the length of the dress.,69334,4
69334,It is a bit short which will make it uncomfortable for me.,69334,4
69334,"Other than that, it's a great buy!",69334,4
69335,I bought these shoes for my daughter for dress up and she loves them.,69335,4
69335,"The little sparkles fall off fairly easy and it didn't come with any extras, so that's the only con.",69335,4
69335,Very cute pair of shoes though.,69335,4
69338,"These hats were really cute, great for the sun!",69338,4
69339,"This ""dress"" is adorable, but I bought it to wear as a tunic because I don't do minis.",69339,4
69339,I'm normally a size 8/10 and ordered the XL.,69339,4
69339,There are two reasons I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars.,69339,4
69339,"It's definitely NOT chiffon, as advertised.",69339,4
69339,"It doesn't have a fabric label inside, but I'm guessing it's either cotton, rayon or a blend because it looks like it will wrinkle fairly easily.",69339,4
69339,"I was expecting a white background because that's how it looks on my computer, but it's way more of a yellowish cream (see my photos).",69339,4
69339,"I was hoping to wear it with white capris but the shade is too off, so I'll wear it with navy capris or jeans.",69339,4
69339,It arrived so wrinkled that I had to wash it before I could even try it on.,69339,4
69339,"My machine has a ""hand wash"" cycle, so I washed it in cold water and then hung it to dry.",69339,4
69339,"All the wrinkles magically came out, and I didn't notice any shrinkage.",69339,4
69339,"I'm wondering if there is more than one version of this dress, using different fabric, because some people say it's very sheer and others say it's not.",69339,4
69339,"Mine is not sheer, which for me is good.",69339,4
69339,"All in all, I would recommend it as long as you're not expecting a chiffon dress with a true white background.",69339,4
69340,"The shirt is light blue, not a dark slate blue like in the picture.",69340,4
69340,"The bag I received it in even said "" dark blue"" it's more of a baby blue though.",69340,4
69340,It's a cute shirt and I like the light blue color.,69340,4
69341,Shirt was great quality and exactly how it was shown.,69341,4
69341,Refer to the 'Big Boy' sizes.,69341,4
69341,Unfortunately we went by the little boys sizes since it said Kids T-shirt but it was WAY too big!,69341,4
69342,Definitely fit smaller than the sizing chart but four stars because I knew this and ordered larger accordingly.,69342,4
69342,I'm a 34/36 (depending on producer) and went xl.,69342,4
69342,They fit awesome and the full drawstring help tighten up.,69342,4
69343,Got these for a gift seams happy with them.,69343,4
69345,"Not impressed with this outfit in person, looks cuter in the picture.",69345,4
69345,Smaller onesie is kind of loose and looks a little weird,69345,4
69346,They look great but are a little small and thin,69346,4
69347,Looks pretty but much shorter than pictures (short model?),69347,4
69347,and does not feel like cotton or even a cotton blend.,69347,4
69347,"I also added two 'strings' in the back to tie and draw in the dress around the waist, otherwise looks a bit tentish.",69347,4
69348,nice scarf at a good price,69348,4
69349,Seems like a great product but too early to tell if it really helps with healing.,69349,4
69349,I did notice my uterus contractions a lot the first day I wore them so I do believe it is helping shrink my uterus.,69349,4
69349,They are also very comfortable and give good support without being too much like the belly band the hospital gave me.,69349,4
69349,If I have another c section I'll wear them again for sure.,69349,4
69350,"""Black matte buckle with black leather belt""
Cut to fit belt.",69350,4
69350,"Leather is amazing quality, just smell it.",69350,4
69350,The buckle I ordered to pair however was way more shiny than I thought it would be.,69350,4
69350,It also looks kinda cheap from close up (due to its shininess).,69350,4
69350,Ratchet system held belt tight and in place without worry.,69350,4
69350,Great quality belt over all.,69350,4
69351,"The pants are really nice, but I don't like the mesh fabric as much as the smooth polyester & spandex fabric of their similar pants (but those don't have pockets & too long of a drawstring)",69351,4
69352,It's hard to find pants with a cell phone pocket that aren't jeans.,69352,4
69352,I carefully cut the hammer loops off for a nicer look in the office.,69352,4
69352,They do shrink over a few washes.,69352,4
69352,I had to re buy at the next size up on waist and length.,69352,4
69353,This is a nice bathing suit.,69353,4
69353,Fits a little loose on the top but very nice quality,69353,4
69355,Read a review these are the best underpants you can get.,69355,4
69355,"They're definitely comfortable but the ""you won't even know they're there"" is a bit of an exaggeration",69355,4
69356,I love these shoes.,69356,4
69357,Very strong for my girl.,69357,4
69358,I have been looking for a brown V Neck t-shirt.,69358,4
69358,"This shirt came quickly, fits perfectly ( I wear size S and ordered size S).",69358,4
69358,Exactly what I wanted.,69358,4
69359,Very cute and I get lots of compliments but the sleeves are just annoyingly small and end up in my armpits.,69359,4
69360,This product was perfect my six year old was so STOKED to get this for her bday she wears a 5t to a extra small 6 and I ordered this in her size the top fit well but the bottom was just a little long witch is ok cuz it will fit her again next summer the color was beautiful I do wish the top was as shimmery as the bottoms but over all loved this mermaid outfit,69360,4
69361,"Tighten the buttons more securely, they fall off too quickly.",69361,4
69362,But I had to exchange this for a large.,69362,4
69362,"The body after washing is quite fitted but the sleeves are almost uncomfortably tight, but I do have wider shoulders, so probably if you have a smaller build one size up is good enough.",69362,4
69363,I have a very small nose so most hoops don't fit me.,69363,4
69363,This one is a little big and the bottom of it still hangs out of my nose but it's the best hoop I've gotten.,69363,4
69364,I like these pieces.,69364,4
69364,The necklace did have one of the black veneers missing when it arrived.,69364,4
69364,I glued it back on.,69364,4
69364,The earrings are heavy.,69364,4
69364,I will be using a disk backing to make them lay correctly.,69364,4
69365,Nice shirt but a little to big.,69365,4
69365,It may shrink after a few washes.,69365,4
69366,Comfy to wear..washes up great.,69366,4
69367,The bottoms fit but the top was waaaay too big,69367,4
69368,"Fit good but tight, I'm 6ft 1 and 180lbs, got an XL and it fits just right, if you're not careful taking it on and off it will tear easily.",69368,4
69368,Also  guys get a cup or something cause otherwise it shows the entire outline of your goods just sayin.,69368,4
69368,I do wish it was easier to see out of the eyes though it's very hard to see anything.,69368,4
69368,But I've gotten nothing but compliments on it so far.,69368,4
69369,"arms tight top to bottom, must have it altered under the arms, (extra material), but it isn't noticeable unless you lift your arms.",69369,4
69369,"and it is shorter then shown, maybe because of my behind and long leg.",69369,4
69369,"its about 2 inches below your fingertips, if you put your hands to your side",69369,4
69370,"Just a little to tight , so I need to lose a few pounds.",69370,4
69370,"The dress is beautiful, seems well made, but I have not wore it yet, we will see in Sept., when I wear it at my granddaughters wedding.",69370,4
69370,"I would have ordered one size larger but 16 was the largest they had, I normally wear 14.",69370,4
69370,They did offer to custom make it for my measurements but I was affaid I might need to return it if I didn't like it.,69370,4
69370,Well I now wish I would have had it custom made.,69370,4
69371,Not that good but for the price i cannot expect more.,69371,4
69372,crystal was smaller than anticipated but not that small.,69372,4
69372,its small enough that i can wear it comfortably underneath clothing 24/7 as the crystal is known to lose its color when exposed to raw sunlight.,69372,4
69372,at the price of about $13.00 your really just paying for the caged crystal itself since the 'necklace' is nothing more than a thin black string.,69372,4
69372,mine didn't even have a clasp and wasn't even tied or threaded to be wearable immediately.,69372,4
69372,cage doesn't even have jump rings to help with threading so it can be worn.,69372,4
69372,fortunately for me i have all the materials to make it a necklace since i craft jewelry.,69372,4
69372,i recycled a super long 30-40 inch silver chain off of a another necklace to put my crystal on.,69372,4
69372,over all the crystal itself is lovely and price is fair for what your getting as your really just paying for a caged crystal,69372,4
69373,Dress fit great and was perfect for my event.,69373,4
69373,I was concerned about the loops in the back for closing the dress.,69373,4
69373,They did seem a bit flimsy.,69373,4
69373,I am happy to report I made it through the night which included dancing sitting and walking from place to place with no worries about loop breakage.,69373,4
69373,"The included lacing ""string"" did come untied multiple times during the night so I would recommend that you take care when completing the lacing step, tie it tight!",69373,4
69374,thought the print was somewhat more vivid.,69374,4
69375,good for wide shoulder.,69375,4
69375,material comfortable but doesn't last.,69375,4
69376,"Nice quality, fit as expected and true to color in pic if not brighter!",69376,4
69377,I love the multi shades of blue and silver.,69377,4
69377,I wish they were not so tight.,69377,4
69378,Was to small gave it to a friend fit perfectly the design is awsome looks great.,69378,4
69379,It came quickly and is true to color.,69379,4
69379,I bought the navy suit in 8-10 but should've gone up to 12-14.,69379,4
69379,It's tight but wearable and will be fine for vacation.,69379,4
69379,Flattering on my tummy but a bit short....it's pulling my boobs down a bit.,69379,4
69380,"Too is very pretty but is a bit shorter than
I like.",69380,4
69380,Thinking maybe I can put a longer top underneath.,69380,4
69381,The dress was a little small.,69381,4
69381,"Other then that, it was great quality.",69381,4
69382,"I don't know about others, but this suit doesn't seem to be as bad as they say.",69382,4
69382,I bought 2 of these for my girlfriend (blue and pink/green and pink) and they are ok for the price.,69382,4
69382,"She is 5'4""/113lbs and 32DD.",69382,4
69382,The small fits a bit snug so I bought a medium the 2nd time.,69382,4
69382,I'll try to get her to let me post pictures so you can see.,69382,4
69383,"Great dress was a success, i wish the fabric had o bit of stretch other wise I am very happy I bought a14 based on reviews and it was a bit loose in the torso area son I would say that it is true to the size because a wear a size 12 in dresses",69383,4
69384,"So, the material used for this dress is amazing.",69384,4
69384,It was so comfortable when I tried it on.,69384,4
69384,But unfortunately it was a bit longer on me then I was hoping so u ended up returning it.,69384,4
69384,Though I would definitely order from them again.,69384,4
69385,Only complaint is that it does not have a clasp.,69385,4
69385,"I like to add extenders to my chains sometimes, and it's not possible with this one.",69385,4
69385,"Otherwise, great value for a cute piece.",69385,4
69386,This was a very cute set with an outfit I had..,69386,4
69387,"As expected, came quickly",69387,4
69388,"This bra holds me in place pretty well, but it's a bit difficult to put on.",69388,4
69388,I purchased it and wore it to a metal concert and it did a good job of wicking away my sweaty stinkiness.,69388,4
69389,At a small size this is still way too big.,69389,4
69390,Fits ok. Could of used more room for a bustier person.,69390,4
69391,Great hat and is holding up great.,69391,4
69392,It fit great and got it faster than expected.,69392,4
69392,It is not as full on me as the pic but I think it is because I am so tall.,69392,4
69392,Still like it and will wear it.,69392,4
69393,"Received mine in the mail today, and I am pleased.",69393,4
69393,Shiny as others have said!,69393,4
69393,Can't wait to test out its resistance to being scratched.,69393,4
69393,It did not come in the little black keepsake bag as displayed in the pictures above.,69393,4
69393,Hence the 4 stars and not 5.,69393,4
69393,I expect what is advertised to be delivered to me.,69393,4
69393,"Anyways, I will say that it you are looking for a ring to match your WHITE GOLD ring then this ring IS NOT for you.",69393,4
69393,I have white gold and it is noticeably off.,69393,4
69393,I am okay with that because I did not plan on wearing them together.,69393,4
69393,I already have a white gold band to match my engagement ring.,69393,4
69393,This ring is specifically for the gym and vacations.,69393,4
69393,I have done a good bit of research and read so many reviews about the colors of these white gold tungsten carbide rings... And I will say that it just depends on how particular your are.,69393,4
69393,I am a easy going kind of girl that will not get up bent out of shape over a $20 ring!,69393,4
69393,"Next up, I will look into the cobalt chrome rings to match my white gold rings.",69393,4
69394,"Looks like picture, DEFINITELY has a nice longer length and isn't ""short/boxy"", perfect for layering but a bit too snug!",69394,4
69394,Very thin fabric makes for a clingy and unflattering look if worn by itself.,69394,4
69394,Would recommend to those looking for this piece as JUST an undershirt/or for the lacy top and bottom-middle and bust (with a bra on) is where the problem is!,69394,4
69395,"Looks exactly like the picture, bought them for my godchild and they are so cute!",69395,4
69396,A little wide in the front and back compared to all my other thongs but it doesn't bother me too much.,69396,4
69397,It's good comfortable it's pretty thin,69397,4
69398,"Somewhat cheap fabric, but still nice.",69398,4
69398,You know when you cut a cotton shirt and because the ends aren't seen they start kind of curling up - I feel like that's what happens with this shirt.,69398,4
69398,It's still cute and comfortable though.,69398,4
69399,Got it for my daughter as a fun Christmas present.,69399,4
69399,"The material is VERY thin but for a fun top, it's O.K.",69399,4
69399,"For the record, this is not a ""Christmas squirrel"", it's a jackalope wearing a hunting cap.",69399,4
69399,"But it's very cute and my daughter for some reason likes jackalopes and her husband is a hunter, so they loved it!",69399,4
69399,My daughter wears a medium and this fit; the bottom is snug but it's a loose style and actually pretty cute on.,69399,4
69400,"Great product, exceptional service.",69400,4
69401,"Just like other reviews, some of the zippers (large teeth) would get stuck, but I used the bar of soap trick and after a few back & forth, they now work just fine.",69401,4
69401,This is a light and very versatile bag.,69401,4
69401,"I just toss my smaller cloth bag into it when in a hurry; it is large enough to throw in a sweater, or notebooks/books and water!",69401,4
69401,Glad I got this bag.,69401,4
69402,I ordered this 'dress' in a 14/16 (On the tag it's shows 4XL) because I wanted to make sure it had a nice oversized fit on me.,69402,4
69402,"I am 5'7, and normally wear a L or XL in tops and a 10 or 12 in dresses.",69402,4
69402,"While it is very cute on, personally I could not wear it without leggings underneath, or I'd be in serious danger of flashing someone!",69402,4
69402,The size I ordered is perfect for the look I wanted to achieve.,69402,4
69402,The only reason I took off a star is because there are a few threads coming loose at the very top of the sleeve (the part at the shoulder near the neckline) and pretty soon I feel that I may have to get my sewing kit out and fix that seam.,69402,4
69402,"I think I have washed this item 3 times so far (I'm a messy eater and I have kids) in cool water, on delicate cycle, low spin, and hung to dry...it has washed up quite nicely with just a tiny bit of shrinkage.",69402,4
69402,"The material is actually kind of thick, not sweatshirt-thick...think of men's tee shirt material, but way softer.",69402,4
69402,This is actually nice because it is not see thru at all!,69402,4
69402,"This item would definitely transition well from Spring to Summer, and can be dressed up or down in a variety of ways.",69402,4
69403,Dress is cute and fits as expected.,69403,4
69403,I'm 5'1'' and 125 lbs.,69403,4
69404,It's very cute and flattering.,69404,4
69404,The material is very soft and minimizes my waist and skims over my stomach.,69404,4
69404,"It's lower cut than I expected, but a cammy or safety pin fixes that.",69404,4
69405,Got this for my daughter who was invited to a descendants themed birthday party.,69405,4
69405,"She loves it, it held up in the wash but I can see how after time the iron on picture may peel off.",69405,4
69405,"However, so far, so good!",69405,4
69407,Just a cute coin purse for my American Phillippino granddaughter.,69407,4
69408,Did shrink a bit in the wash.,69408,4
69409,I am 5 feet and weight 110 and the small fits great.,69409,4
69409,They are little long at the bottom but can easily be hemmed or tucked up.,69409,4
69409,They are a bit see through on the backside which is why I only gave it 4 stars.,69409,4
69409,I bought spandex shorts to wear under it.,69409,4
69409,I tried it on with similar tall heels and it looked sexy but not too over the top.,69409,4
69410,I really like the top but it was a little to small and with this material I just couldn't make it work.,69410,4
69410,I sent back the size 8 and ordered a 10.,69410,4
69410,I am waiting to get it and I will update this review.,69410,4
69411,Only issue is that the slevees are a bit short.,69411,4
69413,"It came right when it should, which was great.",69413,4
69413,"The material was different from what I was expecting and it is slightly off color, which could just be the picture.",69413,4
69413,It's cute though and very light and flowy and perfect for summer!,69413,4
69416,Nice quality shirt for a reasonable price,69416,4
69417,Comfortable and fits well,69417,4
69418,Size up if u don't like it to cling to your body.,69418,4
69418,A bit sheer if u order the lighter colors.,69418,4
69419,The item was exactly as I expected it to be in terms of drape and fit.,69419,4
69419,Perfect extra little layer with a little contouring.,69419,4
69419,"Unfortunately, manufacturing and fabric leave a lot to be desired.",69419,4
69419,"A small hole under the arm developed after one wearing, and after one gentle-cycle cold water, mild detergent & line dry treatment, The pilling has started.",69419,4
69419,"I was hoping to order a bunch of these in different colors, but all I can say is these are cheaply made and I feel disappointed.",69419,4
69420,it's a nice product but i didn't notice that it was made of a material called alloy.,69420,4
69420,"this material makes it look really light and kinda cheap, it's cute but I'd prefer the gold version over the silver to be honest.",69420,4
69421,"It fits as expected, no surprise, color, length and everything is OK and by the way I bought it for my wife.",69421,4
69422,Overall it runs small but once I shredded it it was an ok fit.,69422,4
69423,"Lightweight, washes well , comfortable",69423,4
69424,"little on the cheap side, but still love it!",69424,4
69425,This bag was not as big as I expected but it is a nice size for a Summer bag!,69425,4
69426,"It's sort of snug in the upper part of the shirt, but, overall, I like it.",69426,4
69427,Wish they came in half sizes!,69427,4
69429,IT FIT GREAT THE ONLY THING WAS WE ORDERED THE ORANGE AND PINK IS WHAT WE GOT.,69429,4
69429,THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO HAVE IT SENT BACK AND THE ORANGE SENT BACK OUT.,69429,4
69430,"I was excited to get these.. however, I was disappointed that they were slightly defective on the top.",69430,4
69430,It was like something touched them before the colors were dry so it left indents.,69430,4
69430,Still a good buy though.,69430,4
69431,"Its to small which is too bad im 205lb 5'7""  n i got a 2x.",69431,4
69431,In the pics it looks like it really long but its not as long as i thought it was gonna be which is disapointing.,69431,4
69431,I couldn't find a size chart so i went off of the coments and its to small like 4 or 5 inches to small :/... n i didn't know it ships from china which would make since why its so small i normal am a large not a 2x..,69431,4
69432,"I loved it, it fit my abnormally large head but unfortunately it only survived one summer before it disintegrated before my very eyes.",69432,4
69432,"The straws became all loose in the back, and before I knew it, there was a hole the size of a meteor crater in the back of the hat.",69432,4
69432,"At first I was in denial, and thought I could still rock it, but as the gaping hole became bigger and more furious, all I could do was watch in horror as my favorite hat fell apart.",69432,4
69432,This summer is a sad one.,69432,4
69433,"Wish it were just a wee bit larger so cards go in and out easier, but pleased overall.",69433,4
69435,Quality material has been used to create the garment,69435,4
69436,"I chose to give four stars because I think they're very high quality and comfortable, provided you select the correct sizing.",69436,4
69436,Another factor would be whether or not 2x(i)sts' brand sizing is right for your particular body type.,69436,4
69436,"The fifth star is based on my personal experience with 2x(i)st boxer briefs, which so far has not been successful.",69436,4
69437,This is very nice and should be a great accessory for upcoming cruise.,69437,4
69438,Made for smaller frames.,69438,4
69438,Can be dressed up.,69438,4
69438,Purchased the shirt with blue sleeves.,69438,4
69439,they are beyond what I expected.,69439,4
69439,Really comfortable and perfect height.,69439,4
69440,Great pair of fun boots!,69440,4
69441,"This item is a great, cheap denim jacket!",69441,4
69441,I ordered one and it was pretty much a tight fit on me since i did get a small.,69441,4
69441,The color was a little off but thats fine and i like the look of the jacket :) If your looking for a cheap high quality jacket this is the one.,69441,4
69442,These earings are in 14k white gold with cubic zirconia stones that are equivalent to 1.5 carrot weight each.,69442,4
69442,It comes in a pretty red jewelry box with a little bow attached to it.,69442,4
69442,I purchased them as a Christmas gift for a friend & she only wears them a couple days throughout the week so that they remain sparkly.,69442,4
69442,I also have a pair for myself and I have worn the during the day taking them off before bed for the past week and they are still very pretty.,69442,4
69442,I even wore them in the shower a few times.,69442,4
69442,They did get a little dingy looking but not bad or anything so I simply soaked them in hot water with just a tiny drop of dawn dish soap and swished them around in it with a plastic spoon to remove any residue off of them.,69442,4
69442,It worked well & when I runs them off to dry them they looked brand new again.,69442,4
69442,I wouldn't recommend wearing them 24/7 however I do recommend buying them for occasional wear.,69442,4
69442,They look really nice with your hair up and will go with anything that you would like to wear.,69442,4
69443,I really like this bathing suit.,69443,4
69443,The only reason i am giving it four stars is because the top is a bit small.,69443,4
69443,I will most likely be buying another one in a different color.,69443,4
69444,"I love the suit, but it's a tad big.",69444,4
69444,I went with other reviews and went a size up (I normally wear medium).,69444,4
69444,The top is fine once I adjusted the straps (I am a 36C bust) and the bottoms feel a bit loose around the hips and in the butt area.,69444,4
69444,Maybe it will fit better once I gain my muscle back.,69444,4
69444,I am 5'6 154 lbs.,69444,4
69444,Normally a 9 in pants and medium in shirts.,69444,4
69445,"They slide down my  hips a little, but I often have that issue with leggings",69445,4
69446,looks great a little thin and a little smaller than expected,69446,4
69447,Not as nice as pics depict,69447,4
69448,This dress is awesome super cute fits great,69448,4
69449,It was a lot thinner than the picture showed it to be but I will be keeping it.,69449,4
69451,Ordered this for an event at work.,69451,4
69451,I wore a nude colored shirt under it to keep it appropriate.,69451,4
69451,"I received a lot of compliments on the costume as a whole, but wrist bandscwere a lityle small and I gave narrow wists.",69451,4
69451,Other than that I revommend this costume!,69451,4
69452,"These are very cute but fit a bit smaller than their listed size, even for something purchased online.",69452,4
69453,Has a small toe box but otherwise a very comfortable shoe,69453,4
69454,Pin fell off but possibly user fault.,69454,4
69455,Shoe size was little smaller than I expected.,69455,4
69455,Would prefer to order next size which should be bigger and correct fit.,69455,4
69455,I like the quality of the product.,69455,4
69456,"The size is perfect for every day, it holds my phone in the outside pocket.",69456,4
69456,"My only complaint is that the inside material is slick, and the pockets are on the loose side, so many cards tend to fall out.",69456,4
69456,Good thing it zips up.,69456,4
69458,Thats ok. Is what I want.,69458,4
69459,"Material is somewhat ""plastic"" like.",69459,4
69459,Definitely consider wearing an undershirt when wearing this.,69459,4
69459,I'm a fairly standard sized 5'11 male and this fit perfectly.,69459,4
69460,"I ordered according to measurements, not my normal shirt size and it fits slightly big.",69460,4
69460,Should've ordered one size down from what the measurements indicated I should.,69460,4
69460,"But, it'll definitely work!",69460,4
69461,The wallet is nice and small but the outside pocket slots stick HARD to anything put in them.,69461,4
69462,great kind of see through however,69462,4
69463,"Great shirt, soft, and the right length.",69463,4
69463,"I'm 6'1"" with a tall torso.",69463,4
69463,It's hard to find shirts that fit but this one does!,69463,4
69463,My son wanted one just like me.,69463,4
69464,It's very good and protective.,69464,4
69464,But lenses get scratched with ease.,69464,4
69465,Overall i really like this bikini.,69465,4
69465,"It is NOT neoprene, but I actually like it better that it's just swimsuit material.",69465,4
69465,The netting detail is really cute and there is no loose stitching.,69465,4
69465,It came with removable straps they were just a little hard to put on.,69465,4
69465,"I'm 5'6"" 130 lbs.",69465,4
69465,and I got the medium; the bottom fit perfectly but the top was somewhat big.,69465,4
69465,There is a lot of push up padding in the cups that is not removable.,69465,4
69467,I like the product and delivered in time.,69467,4
69468,The backs of the pins are very cheap but this can be replaced.,69468,4
69468,Otherwise I'm happy with my purchase.,69468,4
69469,I really love this ring!,69469,4
69469,"I usually wear a size 6, but it was too big, so I switched to a 5 and it fits very nicely.",69469,4
69469,I love the sparkle!,69469,4
69470,I loved this dress but the bust area was way too small.,69470,4
69470,Order a larger size!,69470,4
69471,It fits a little as expected.,69471,4
69472,This swim suit fits well.,69472,4
69472,I bought it for a beach trip but ended up needing to wear it for a swim lesson today.,69472,4
69472,It stayed in place and provides full butt coverage.,69472,4
69472,It lost a star only because the cups are strange to me and slightly unnecessary.,69472,4
69472,"It would be better without the cups, but overall I am very satisfied with it.",69472,4
69472,I wear a size 16 and ordered a 4XL.,69472,4
69474,"Cute shirt, glad I read the reviews to order a bigger size because it runs small.",69474,4
69474,"Ordered a 3X, it fits like a large.",69474,4
69474,Overall it fits nicely!,69474,4
69475,"My dress fits,  I just lost about 3 pounds, so it's a bit loose but beautiful all the same.",69475,4
69477,This cut is smaller than most other garments this size.,69477,4
69478,Great shirt and great quality but runs way too big for my sons actual size.,69478,4
69479,Material is thin and gauzy and they are long and flowing.,69479,4
69479,I had the belt removed because it seemed like too much.,69479,4
69480,I'd say it fits as expected.,69480,4
69480,I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs and ordered a small.,69480,4
69480,It's good for the beach or pool.,69480,4
69480,I hate that it arrived all wrinkly.,69480,4
69480,I'll have to iron it to see how it truly looks.,69480,4
69481,"This product runs small by US standards, I bought a size up and still barely fit.",69481,4
69481,Aside from that-the quality is good and comes as it appears in the image.,69481,4
69482,"Decent quality, but the length was a little longer than I was hoping for.",69482,4
69482,I'm 5'2 and it came to a couple inches above my knees.,69482,4
69483,"Not too good if you have small boobs, there will be a gap on the sides",69483,4
69484,"stays on well, and feels comfortable when wearing it.",69484,4
69485,"I like the Leveret pj sets, they're good quality and I like the designs.",69485,4
69485,"However, they do run quite small.",69485,4
69485,"My son just turned 8, is about 52"" and 80 pounds, and I order size 12 so they're not uncomfortably restricting.",69485,4
69486,They did the job but you can't wear them if you are wearing really thin fabric.,69486,4
69486,"I was wearing chiffon fabric and you could see the outline of the petals, ( I wasn't wearing a bra) They did cover my nipples really well.",69486,4
69486,"Recommendation:  don't try to rip them off, take a shower and then you can ease them off in the shower when they are wet.",69486,4
69486,They didn't leave any sticky residue when I did take them off.,69486,4
69487,I didn't get to use this product yet but the colors are slightly more white vs cream.,69487,4
69488,Item is as expected and no real issues.,69488,4
69489,Like the way of thickness fit but it has no stainless steel n it the color of bracelet turned less than a week t,69489,4
69492,Going on 4 months with this product and it is holding up very well.,69492,4
69492,Can't fit very much cash in with my cards though.,69492,4
69493,I actually love my Scarfand Chunky Knit Scarf!,69493,4
69493,Its the perfect size for my body type.,69493,4
69493,"I'm a big guy, 6'2 280 and the scarf covers my entire midsection when not double wrapped.",69493,4
69493,"So if you're short it will be super long but thats not a bad thing, just fyi.",69493,4
69493,Its warm and stylish.,69493,4
69493,I have a beard and the scarf sheds against my beard like CRAZY.,69493,4
69493,when I take the scarf off I always have to brush the knit out of my beard.,69493,4
69493,Or my friends end up pulling it out for me.,69493,4
69493,Other than that the scarf is great!,69493,4
69494,"You can adjust the size, however the clasp does not stay well.",69494,4
69494,The overall look of the hat was as expected.,69494,4
69495,I love it !,69495,4
69495,"Something totally different, but in the photo  it shows blue flowers mine is purple no big deal I love the front & back!",69495,4
69496,The pink is definitely not as pink like in the picture but it is still a nice band.,69496,4
69497,"so far so good, only had them about 1 week",69497,4
69498,I love this outfit HOWEVER the pants appear to be the correct sizing (6months) but the t-shirt looks like it's made for a 4 year old.,69498,4
69498,It's a cute outfit too bad my baby will never wear it as such.,69498,4
69499,"Very nice socks,  I ordered are supposed to fit size 7 to 12.",69499,4
69499,They are slightly large on a size 10 foot.,69499,4
69499,They are not so large that I would return them.,69499,4
69500,Runs a full size smaller than the size it is labeled.,69500,4
69501,I'm so happy I bought this dress.,69501,4
69501,"It fit as expected, but some of the reviews stated it ran large but 4 me it didn't.",69501,4
69501,I bought a Med.,69501,4
69501,but I'm usually a large.,69501,4
69501,It's OK since the material is stretchy.,69501,4
69501,If you have a bit of a tummy that's OK to since it hides that area.,69501,4
69501,Only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is bcuz I should've gotten a large.,69501,4
69502,Love the phrase on it and the fit.,69502,4
69504,"He likes it, and it seems to be wearing nicely.",69504,4
69505,In a juniors size I wear a size large.,69505,4
69505,I put it on and it fit perfectly.,69505,4
69505,Not tight on me at all.,69505,4
69506,Doesn't come over the ears too well though.,69506,4
69507,The winder does not make a sound.,69507,4
69507,"Watch fits, plugged in and it worked.",69507,4
69507,"There were no instructions or details as to what the settings were, but for now I suppose it doesn't matter.",69507,4
69507,"Four settings A,B,C,D and Left, Right and Automatic.",69507,4
69508,First pair of Scott's.,69508,4
69508,I bought these for short runs below 5 miles.,69508,4
69508,"At 61, need a little more cushioning for long runs.",69508,4
69508,"Have used them a couple of times and they feel nice, especially for the price.",69508,4
69508,Will check back in after I have some miles on these.,69508,4
69509,"Amazing deal, got them as an Amazon add-on.",69509,4
69509,"Fit well, and the fur didn't fall out everywhere.",69509,4
69510,It is exactly what was expected.,69510,4
69510,Was a little small.,69510,4
69510,We are returning it for a larger one.,69510,4
69510,Only dislike is that it cost me  1/3rd of price to mail it back,69510,4
69511,Ordered March 19 and arrived April 02 for $54.35.,69511,4
69511,Material is thin and falls nicely.,69511,4
69511,"The should is narrow, therefore the shoulder pads are in the middle between neck and where the arm begins.",69511,4
69511,"I am a true size 14,  I would say this jacket is about a size 10.",69511,4
69511,I wish it's a bit bigger.,69511,4
69513,i use this for model photography and consider it adequate for casual wear for more than one time.,69513,4
69514,Love this and it does really glow,69514,4
69515,Exactly what I was looking for!,69515,4
69515,They will be the perfect summertime kicks and will look less mom-ish than the keds I was wearing last summer.,69515,4
69516,Purchased these for my daughters for Valentines Day as gift.,69516,4
69516,They loved the cute idea.,69516,4
69516,"One arrived perfect, the other quite a bit of dust in the globe.",69516,4
69517,It is what i really expected.,69517,4
69517,Cards and ID's are exactly fit and my phone is exactly fits in it.,69517,4
69518,The product was packaged very well.,69518,4
69518,It arrived in perfect condition.,69518,4
69518,It is very nice and didn't have any defects.,69518,4
69518,I'm a curvy Latina and even tho I followed the size chart I would have probably gone up a size only because of the material.,69518,4
69518,It is very snug.,69518,4
69518,But it still fits and looks very nice.,69518,4
69519,I received my hat today and was able to give it a small test.,69519,4
69519,I went for a ride in my car with no top in 37F weather up to 80MPH.,69519,4
69519,"My head stayed super warm, and with the flaps all down my neck and most of my face was warm enough.",69519,4
69519,"The fit was good, just measure your head and you should be fine.",69519,4
69519,"I'm a little worried about the straps and snaps that secure the side flaps being a bit too light-weight to last too many years, but maybe they're stronger than I think.",69519,4
69519,My wife liked it enough we plan to shop for one in the right color and fur for her so she can ride in my car (it has no top to put up) when it's cold out.,69519,4
69520,Fits but it's a big snug.,69520,4
69520,Works good enough though!,69520,4
69522,It came just as pictured!,69522,4
69522,It's pretty soft too.,69522,4
69522,"Though when it arrived it smelled strongly of silicone, oddly enough.",69522,4
69522,That was fixed after a good wash though.,69522,4
69522,"Other than that, it's great!",69522,4
69523,"Looks exactly like the picture, the metal isn't bendable or doesnt bend easily.",69523,4
69524,I gave this to my sister and it is too small.,69524,4
69525,These are very nice.,69525,4
69525,"Thought I was getting more of a floppy, slouch hat, but didn't come as floppy as I had hoped.",69525,4
69525,Nice hats anyway :-),69525,4
69526,I bought this for my honeymoon and it was great!,69526,4
69526,It was a bit large and boxy but that was fine because I just needed a light cover up to walk from the hotel to the beach.,69526,4
69527,"Runs small, I had to buy one size up for my 2year old boy... but also he is a little big for his age.",69527,4
69528,I loved how cute it is.,69528,4
69528,And it was a little small for a medium size.,69528,4
69528,But other than that I llove it.,69528,4
69530,"The material is a little flimsy, but for the price is a good deal.",69530,4
69530,Has a nice large brim.,69530,4
69530,I love that you can use the strap or take it off.,69530,4
69530,Nice heavy wire in brim to fold up if I need to see better.,69530,4
69531,I love this dress.,69531,4
69531,although it didn't hang off my shoulder as expected it was a good buy.,69531,4
69532,Cute shirt although size up since they run small,69532,4
69533,"Now that it has been worn intermittently by a young adult (gently worn) for several weeks, the stitching on a seam came loose.",69533,4
69533,"Easily repairable, but shouldn't have to.",69533,4
69534,"A little snug, but a great buy!",69534,4
69535,I ordered up a size since I read that it runs small.,69535,4
69535,It fits great everywhere except the chest.,69535,4
69535,The chest area is a little awkwardly done.,69535,4
69535,"I love the material, though!",69535,4
69536,This dress was what I expected after reading the reviews.,69536,4
69536,"Definitely runs SMALL, so buy up!",69536,4
69536,"It's a cheaply made formal, but worked for what I needed it for....so I'm happy with it.",69536,4
69536,"You get what you pay for, so keep that in mind when purchasing.",69536,4
69536,Bought for my 12 year old who wears a size 12 in girls or a 0/00 in juniors.,69536,4
69536,Bought a size 2 expecting to have to get it taken in and didn't have to.,69536,4
69536,"In fact, it almost didn't zip up (she has no tummy or chest, so that wasn't an issue).",69536,4
69536,All in all it's a decent dress for the money.,69536,4
69537,LOVE THE COLOR LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE.,69537,4
69537,IT FITS GOOD BUT COULD BE A LITTLE SNUG FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR THE FIT TOWARD THE TOP.,69537,4
69537,GREAT LENGTH VERY CUTE.,69537,4
69538,I like everything about this except for the fact that it wrinkles like crazy.,69538,4
69539,The items was fine and what I thought it would be.,69539,4
69539,But some how I now get a soliciting text and emails at 5am.,69539,4
69539,Not sure how my number was inquired by them.,69539,4
69540,Overall it's great for the price.,69540,4
69540,The review said it ran small so I ordered a medium but would've been better off with my usual small.,69540,4
69540,"The sleeves are a little long but I am only 5'1"".",69540,4
69540,Also the belt was falling out of the loops a lot so I took a large safety pin and pinned it to stay on (I pinned from the inside so you can't see the pin at all.),69540,4
69541,This Wallet goes great with my Mona B Tri shoulder Bag that I also got.,69541,4
69541,The sipper is a little rough and I wish there were more sleeves for my cards.,69541,4
69541,I wish the sleeves were not as deep so my cards wouldn't go so far for better access.,69541,4
69541,Other than that I did receive it quickly and I do like it.,69541,4
69542,It's a nice scarf.,69542,4
69542,It is %100 silk and soft.,69542,4
69542,"The description says 35.4"" by 35.4"", but it is actually 32"" by 32"".",69542,4
69542,The colors are more saturated in the pictures.,69542,4
69543,Cheaply made but very nice fit and flattering on my curves,69543,4
69544,"Pretty fabric , light weight for summer temps.",69544,4
69545,"Fits great, the top was a little narrower than I thought but its not too scandalous.",69545,4
69546,Only negative thing is that the front pockets need to be tucked in after standing.,69546,4
69546,"Plus the pocket material shows through the front of the pants, so that you see a slight bulge from the pocket material.",69546,4
69546,I think I would prefer no front pockets in this type of pant.,69546,4
69547,"Even though Im returning these jeans, I rated them 4 because they are just sooooo cute!",69547,4
69547,The fit is perfect for me.,69547,4
69547,I adore the high waist.,69547,4
69547,"Some have mentioned the waist is a little bit tight, but I bought my normal size and I felt I could wear them for an extended period of time w/o discomfort.",69547,4
69547,"My reasoning for returning them is simply because I have long legs (Im 5'7"") and a love for jeans that touch the floor when I wear heels.",69547,4
69547,"These jeans were just not long enough for my taste, but I realize that a lot of girls/women don't necessarily want jeans THAT long, so I didn't want to give them a low rating simply because of my unique preference.",69547,4
69547,"I think a shorter woman, or women who wear flats/boots, would be pretty happy with these.",69547,4
69547,These would have been my favorite jean in the world had they be longer.,69547,4
69548,"I think the shirt size is right, but I overestimated my size.",69548,4
69548,I'll probably buy more.,69548,4
69550,"i quite enjoy this shirt, i bought this for my self and i really like it highly recomend, the only consern is the washing instructions",69550,4
69551,runs a bit small but still nice,69551,4
69552,Love this necklace very eye catching I get a lot of compliments on it kinda feel like a gypsy wearing it,69552,4
69553,Very comfortable and lightweight.,69553,4
69553,I'm 38 weeks pregnant and I got it in medium.,69553,4
69553,Usually wear a small.,69553,4
69553,Wish they had more colors,69553,4
69554,Love it but should have gotten a smaller size,69554,4
69556,My daughter loves Wiz!,69556,4
69556,"The shirt which is really more of a thick sweatshirt, has a silky texture.",69556,4
69556,"I have started to notice it's starting to pile, you know.",69556,4
69556,The little balls of material.,69556,4
69556,"Maybe the tag says it, I didn't look but- I would wash on gentle and hang to dry to avoid that.",69556,4
69556,Overall it's a shirt and does its job.,69556,4
69557,Great for the price and it was flattering!,69557,4
69557,Comfortable to wear.. it's not the best quality but it's good for the a costume,69557,4
69559,Just a tad larger than needed.,69559,4
69559,Good material and assembly.,69559,4
69560,"It's a bit large, but, I have a large head and low hairline.",69560,4
69560,It fits me nicely but will probably be a bit big for a lot of people.,69560,4
69561,My son loves this shirt.,69561,4
69561,The quality is a little questionable but not a deal breaker.,69561,4
69561,I personally thing this shirt is worth the money I paid.,69561,4
69561,I have bought many full priced authentic sports label clothes and this product was pretty much what I expected.,69561,4
69561,If my son was reviewing it I am sure he would give it 5/5 stars but he is also 5 years old sooooo......,69561,4
69562,This suit did not disappoint!,69562,4
69562,I bought this for a Vegas pool party and it was perfect!,69562,4
69562,The only downside is I did wear my invisible bra with it so I didn't fall out of the sides.,69562,4
69562,I wouldn't really recommend wearing it in the water too much.,69562,4
69562,It's more for the look.,69562,4
69562,It fits true to size and is adjustable.,69562,4
69562,I will buy this again in other colors.,69562,4
69564,"My daughter LOVES this mermaid costume, but that's really what it is, a play costume.",69564,4
69564,"I was expecting a mermaid ""swimsuit"" that she could wear in the pool, this really isn't that.",69564,4
69564,"But like I said, she loves it and hasn't taken it off all day.",69564,4
69564,"The colors are great and bright, and it's very cute.",69564,4
69565,Unfortunately I had to return it because it didn't meet my husband's very particular requirements.,69565,4
69566,Great for cosplay or fashion.,69566,4
69566,"They're a little flimsy, but that's to be expected and it doesn't affect the comfort.",69566,4
69566,"I took the lenses out of mine easily, it didn't break them or anything.",69566,4
69566,Overall they're very nice!,69566,4
69567,I returned the first one because it was too big even though usually I am a large but this one the top fit much better however I didn't like the pants so I switched out for other black nylon sweatpants I had and it turned out good!,69567,4
69568,Purchased this brand before and been pleased.,69568,4
69568,Not tight or binding and I love the fact that the straps are adjustable!,69568,4
69568,"Straps are elastic, but hold very well and don't seem to stretch out.",69568,4
69569,Fits like a dress.,69569,4
69569,Ordered a medium which is my usual size.,69569,4
69569,You could probably order a size down if you don't want it to look like a dress.,69569,4
69570,"I ordered 3X, which fits well, but I normally wear XXL or 1X.",69570,4
69570,I removed (unbuttoned) the faux fur on hood.,69570,4
69571,Received my package earlier than expected.,69571,4
69571,"Cute outfit, cheap sewed and the material.",69571,4
69572,"Great dress, a little long!",69572,4
69573,"It is quality, just expected bigger in size.",69573,4
69574,What I expected it to be,69574,4
69575,The color is beautiful and the leather is so soft with a nice sheen.,69575,4
69575,"It's appears to look light brown in the picture, but it's actually a burnt orange.",69575,4
69575,"It hangs well when it's empty, but looks good when it's full.",69575,4
69575,"It could use a couple of pockets on the inside to store small items like lipstick, pencils and hand sanitizer, but having plenty of room is not an issue, you just don't want those things lying down.",69575,4
69575,"Overall, it's a wonderful product and I plan to use it for a long, long time.",69575,4
69576,"Very nice skirt, and with a nice cut and lovely printed material.",69576,4
69576,"You can tell that the quality of the stitching is not exceedingly high, but at the same time this skirt gives the exact effect as other skirts which are hundreds of dollars.",69576,4
69576,I am pleased with my purchase.,69576,4
69578,Original and good material.,69578,4
69580,I did not expect much considering the price.,69580,4
69580,The beard is very cheap and the hat is uncomfortable.,69580,4
69580,I also don't have a large head and this was small on me.,69580,4
69580,my fitted baseball hat size is 6 7/8 - 7.,69580,4
69580,I wear a medium in the elastic banded fitted hats.,69580,4
69580,hope that will give you a rough estimate on the fitting o f this hat.,69580,4
69581,Just a bit tight,69581,4
69582,"They were a bit too purple for my liking, I was hoping for green to be the more standout color.",69582,4
69582,"Gave them to my daughter who happens to love purple, so it's all good.",69582,4
69583,"Perfect for lightweight and two inch binders as well as a small supply bag
It's lovely however the silver belt buckle broke off immediately which leaves the belt flapping around",69583,4
69585,"A little small, will need to add a couple of links to fit better!",69585,4
69585,My wrists are of medium size and just can get toggle fastened.,69585,4
69585,"The size of the squares and chain are smaller than expected, too, but all in all beautifully made.",69585,4
69585,Rose Gold and design very pretty.,69585,4
69585,Looks more expensive than it was.,69585,4
69585,"Expect a tight fit, tho.",69585,4
69586,"Definitely love the color and the shape, but it's easily scratched on so be careful and show the kids how to properly store it might help.",69586,4
69587,a lot of complements on this ring but some of the stones have already fallen out of the band.,69587,4
69587,But is one of my favorite rings.,69587,4
69588,"They fit a bit snug in the hand and wrist area which made them tough to get on, but fingers are correct length.",69588,4
69588,Bought for my 4 year old boy.,69588,4
69588,He likes them a lot though and the clip to keep them together is a nice feature!,69588,4
69589,Top quality goat skin leather backpack.,69589,4
69589,All zippers work easily.,69589,4
69589,Draw straps are included to compact your load.,69589,4
69589,The adjustment clips for the shoulder straps do not allow for very much adjustment leaving the straps too long.,69589,4
69589,"There are loads of pockets for storage - but, many of the pockets are really too small for use.",69589,4
69589,These drawbacks are the only reasons that I didn't give the pack 5 stars.,69589,4
69592,"Great size for my money, cards, and phone.",69592,4
69592,Easy to carry into the grocery store or on an evening out.,69592,4
69592,"The zipper has held up with lots of use the past 3 months, but feels a bit flimsy.",69592,4
69592,Overall a really great purchase for me!,69592,4
69593,"I'm normally a 32D, I bought my sister size 34C.",69593,4
69593,"It was still too small, and it had a stain",69593,4
69594,Pretty dress just small in chest area,69594,4
69595,Somewhat snug but definitely not to the point of discomfort.,69595,4
69595,"Ordered size 12 just to be safe, sometimes an 11 1/2 will fit better for me depending style/brand of the shoe/boot.",69595,4
69595,All in all I'm happy with the shoes.,69595,4
69596,Thinner then I had expected but wears well otherwise.,69596,4
69596,The double ended zipper is a plus.,69596,4
69597,Nice style.. sexy but runs small.,69597,4
69597,No pouch for package.,69597,4
69597,A lil spandex so a little wiggle room.,69597,4
69597,"But if you have big thighs, big butt or packing in front, order 2 sizes up and you'll be fine.",69597,4
69598,"The bust area was a bit too big for me but overall I liked it, the material is very soft as well.",69598,4
69599,A bit heavier than expected but I like them a lot.,69599,4

Got this for my sister for a gift.",69600,4
69600,It is nice but the words are just a  a little difficult to read.,69600,4
69601,"It's perfect for a pendant that I have, but I wish it had a necklace lobster clasp instead of a key chain closer.",69601,4
69602,Very cute - hasn't tarnished and I have been wearing for over a year!,69602,4
69603,Sleeves are a bit tight at the wrist however it fits really nice!,69603,4
69604,Received a lot of compliments in the fit,69604,4
69606,Great casual shirt to wear with jeans!,69606,4
69608,Very comfortable and sexy!,69608,4
69608,I wore them walking the Halloween Parade and at a show...2 long nights and felt no pain.,69608,4
69608,They did sort of unglued a bit so don't get these for long term use.,69608,4
69610,"Chain seems a little cheap, but I like the charm, which is why I purchased in the first place.",69610,4
69611,The rounded metal loops which hold the watch strap in place after its on tended to get in the way of my wearing it without discomfort.,69611,4
69611,But the the durability is excellent.,69611,4
69612,I love this makeup bag it fits all my 'bits' in there and they remain clearly visible and are organized.,69612,4
69612,They don't disappear into the abyss and I'm not forever wasting precious minutes before work hunting for certain makeup items!,69612,4
69613,"looks great, I have the medium.",69613,4
69613,"i am 5' 7"" and 150lbs and these came slightly loose/large.",69613,4
69613,"I guess the small would have been too snug, so too bad there is no such thing as an extra medium",69613,4
69614,Everyone on here says the sizes run small but i personally disagree im 5'4 146 pounds and i totally could have gotten away with a small while a meduim fits im in the second notch as soon as i put it on and thats kinda disspointing the point of a wasit trainer for me is to get your waist snatched and this is not going to give me that so somwhat dissapointed hope this review helps,69614,4
69615,"The ""apricot"" is actually tan and not a very attractive color.",69615,4
69615,The texting tips are silly.,69615,4
69615,"But they are very soft and warm, and that was my main priority.",69615,4
69616,"Nicely done, especially for the price.",69616,4
69617,"falling apart a little after a couple of wears and washes, but very cute.",69617,4
69618,Was bought for a baby gift.,69618,4
69618,Really can't say how it fits.,69618,4
69619,"I liked the dress, the flower seems a bit off because of the tiny that holds it, seems it would fall off.",69619,4
69620,This top is great.,69620,4
69620,"I was hoping for something to wear with shorts but it's too long for that for someone who is 5'1"".",69620,4
69620,However it looks great with Capri leggings!,69620,4
69620,I will definitely order other colors!,69620,4
69622,It was just what I wanted for my trip to Spain.,69622,4
69622,It packs well and doesn't show wrinkles.,69622,4
69622,It is the perfect weight for cool evenings.,69622,4
69623,Loved this for my son and his wifes shower.,69623,4
69625,My daughter got so many compliments when she wore it to school.,69625,4
69626,"Really cute, I got an extra large knowing a lot of clothes that come from China run small.",69626,4
69626,it's a bit tight.,69626,4
69628,"Reviews said it fit a little large, so I ordered my size hoping it would fit comfortably.",69628,4
69628,It fits but definitely snug!,69628,4
69630,Nice shirt I love the material and the style,69630,4
69631,"Its too large for mi high 5'5 but fixs so good in general, a pretty one, so beautiful",69631,4
69632,upgraded because my wife just doesn't like bracelets so we returned it but i think it looked great .,69632,4
69633,Love the green guys,69633,4
69634,I love the first belly bandit that I got for right after the birth.,69634,4
69634,I wore it every day and it was wonderful.,69634,4
69634,I didn't have one after my first kid and it felt like my guts were gonna fall out of me every time I stood up.,69634,4
69634,This time with the belly bandit it was much easier to stand up straight even right after birth.,69634,4
69634,Also my uterus contracted back to normal size in RECORD speed- my midwife was impressed.,69634,4
69634,My stomach also shrunk much faster and I am pleased with the results.,69634,4
69634,"Once I shrank down to the smallest the first BB would go, I decided to get the next size down (extra small).",69634,4
69634,This was a mistake.,69634,4
69634,"Even though the small is now too large, it was time to give up and go for their corset.",69634,4
69634,"The extra small just rolls up on itself and causes me to look all lumpy from outside my clothes so I can't really wear it anywhere besides the house, and the way it scrunches up is uncomfortable.",69634,4
69635,A little too small.,69635,4
69639,like the necklace very much.,69639,4
69640,Just as I expected.,69640,4
69642,"Well, they are comfortable.",69642,4
69642,"But, boy howdy are they ugly!",69642,4
69642,"Maybe they would be really cute in a small size, but at a 9, nope--super ugly and bulky.",69642,4
69642,When I pulled them out of the box I thought they were torn because the footbed is removable and you can really see it.,69642,4
69642,"The sole and the footbed are not flush which creates this messy ""chewed up"" look around the edges.",69642,4
69642,"Also, oddly, the sole's inner edge has gold trim and it's weirdly shiny.",69642,4
69642,This causes this strange halo effect around the footbed.,69642,4
69642,That's not a good thing.,69642,4
69642,"Plus, the entire ""metal"" shoe is not silverish, it is actually mostly gold.",69642,4
69642,"So, other than being two-bag ugly (one for each foot)--they are super comfortable and I'm considering keeping them for that reason.",69642,4
69644,Great one for a 2X size.,69644,4
69644,It was a gift and the person appreciated it.,69644,4
69645,I bought this pack for when I go hiking and don't need to bring a ton of water.,69645,4
69645,The pack stayed right where I put it.,69645,4
69645,It didn't sag after I wore it for long periods of time or even when I put my water bottle in it.,69645,4
69645,"I was also able it fit my phone, my keys, and a pack of gum in their pack for my hikes.",69645,4
69645,The only thing that made me upset about this motorist was the water bottle was NOT included.,69645,4
69645,You had to purchase it separately.,69645,4
69645,"At first glance, it seemed liked the water bottle was included but if you kept reading the item description, eventually towards the bottom, it says water bottle not included.",69645,4
69645,"Other than that, I really enjoyed this product.",69645,4
69645,Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a honest and unbiased opinion.,69645,4
69646,wore it on my trip.,69646,4
69646,"it was pretty, but i think i ordered a size too big, but still fit loosely.",69646,4
69647,I bought this thinking I might be able to wear it right now but its spring in Texas and its already getting warm so I will most likely will be wearing in the winter.,69647,4
69647,this dress material is pretty thick and its really cute if you like the teacher look.,69647,4
69648,I read the reviews and ordered the XS/S for my regular size 8.,69648,4
69648,The dress is adorable and looks cute BUT the backside of the dress is super thin material; it is the material you would find on a costume.,69648,4
69648,The fabric kept riding up - I really needed double sided tape but was out of town for a party and didn't have it with me - bad planning on my part.,69648,4
69648,"Again, it is super thin so you need to wear something underneath.",69648,4
69648,"And then when you wear something (a slip, spanx, etc) it is slippery and it rides up.",69648,4
69648,I wore it to an office party and had to make sure I wasn't being in appropriate.,69648,4
69648,"Overall, super cute but make sure you plan ahead!",69648,4
69648,"As it is, I don't really think you can wear it without something underneath,.",69648,4
69649,The quality is pretty good considering the price.,69649,4
69649,It is roomy and comfortable to wear in hot weather.,69649,4
69649,It has been over 85 degrees here most days and I've worn it several times comfortably.,69649,4
69649,"It can be worn casual or with jewelry and nice shoes, it would be more dressy.",69649,4
69649,The material is not super soft.,69649,4
69649,It does wrinkle easy but also irons easy.,69649,4
69649,"The color is pretty close to olive, maybe a little on the yellow side of it.",69649,4
69649,The sleeves do not hit my elbow.,69649,4
69649,"The sewing is good, no loose threads and lines seem straight.",69649,4
69649,I actually liked this enough that I have now ordered another dress from the same company to try out.,69649,4
69650,I like these and think they are better than the Gerber brand or other brands you get at the store.,69650,4
69650,"However, they do leak a bit sometimes.",69650,4
69650,"No huge puddles, but I also purchased the Smartlife brand and I like those better.",69650,4
69650,They use the same concept but I've never had one of them leak.,69650,4
69650,The 100 size fits my boy who wears a 3T.,69650,4
69650,The 90 size fits my girl who wears a 2T.,69650,4
69650,Not understanding the sizing made me hesitant to purchase these.,69650,4
69650,"I still think they're a good deal, but if I needed more I'd go with Smartlife.",69650,4
69651,Very cute and good deal for the price.,69651,4
69652,Cheap and works fine!,69652,4
69653,"It seems like a decent hat, but although it says it goes up to my daughter's age(3), it is rather tight on her head.",69653,4
69654,"I've been wearing Carhartt Carpenter pants for years, and have always been happy with the fit and durability.",69654,4
69655,This slipper is very good for the price.,69655,4
69656,I have this dress in a different shade of denim and I love it.,69656,4
69656,Have not worn this one yet,69656,4
69657,I recommend when ordering to add at least 2 sizes.,69657,4
69657,"I wear a large, I ordered an xl and this is supposed to fit baggy which it didn't it is tight no room if its washed and shrinks at all.",69657,4
69658,These things can save you several dollars (because you don't have to buy new shirts when you gain a few pounds) and work very well.,69658,4
69658,You can't tell you're using them and they don't physically her you while wearing them.,69658,4
69658,The only reason for the 4 star review is they do stretch over time.,69658,4
69658,"That might be expected, however, it seemed like mine stretched faster than I would have expected.",69658,4
69659,"Perhaps it was a difficulty in translating sizes, but this was too small for my daugter.",69659,4
69659,"Ordered 34FF, which we figured was equivalent to 34G (her bra size).",69659,4
69659,It was simply too small.,69659,4
69659,Trying again with a bigger size because the top is cute.,69659,4
69659,"It seems very expensive to me, but you simply can't buy a size 34G off the rack anywhere.",69659,4
69660,Wish there was a velcro pocket inside so my son can hold some coins in the wallet as well.,69660,4
69660,Happy with the product overall.,69660,4
69662,Liked the look and feel but they were too small.,69662,4
69662,Reordering a larger pair.,69662,4
69663,I realized only after I wore this that the tan lines would look terrible.,69663,4
69663,Everyone loves it though and it is a cool suit.,69663,4
69663,The back started tearing at the latch but I sewed it!,69663,4
69664,"Soft, smell great but are a bit small",69664,4
69665,"nice soft tops with good support, I wear a 34 C bra and the size small is too tight, but the size medium is perfect",69665,4
69666,It says the bag is 8inches long which would be perfect for my 7plus.,69666,4
69666,I searched for days for bags with the right dimensions and ordered it for a black and gold themed event.,69666,4
69666,Unfortunately the bag is not as big as I thought.,69666,4
69666,It is an absolutely beautiful bag and luckily I made it work.,69666,4
69666,"I had to take the case off my phone and since the bag is 2+ inches wide, I could fit my phone, lipstick and one compact case.",69666,4
69666,A small travel lotion may have fit too.,69666,4
69666,So many people have larger phones these days and it's a shame to have a small evening bag that doesn't fit much.,69666,4
69666,I've attached a photo that shows the size and compares to another bag from the same designer that is really 8inches long.,69666,4
69667,How to you make a wallet seem slimmer?,69667,4
69667,"I have no idea, or I'd have made a ton making wallets like these.",69667,4
69667,This wallet seems to defy the laws of physics.,69667,4
69667,"When you buy a wallet like this, you want a very thin footprint in a wallet.",69667,4
69667,This one delivers on this promise in spades.,69667,4
69668,Got the job done,69668,4
69669,Top ran big and bottoms were small... made nicely,69669,4
69672,I really  like it but the sizes tend to run  small.,69672,4
69672,you should  buy  it in one size larger than your  normal size.,69672,4
69673,"Not a bad price and in a pinch, it certainly works.",69673,4
69675,I have already bought this wallet twice.,69675,4
69675,"It is nice and cheap, but I think you get what you pay for..",69675,4
69675,I don't think this wallet was built to last.,69675,4
69675,My last one fell apart and the leather started to discolor.,69675,4
69675,"I would buy this wallet, with the expectation of having to replace it again.",69675,4
69675,It is nice and pretty when you first get it.,69675,4
69675,"Since I have no qualms about getting some decent use out of a cheap product, I would buy this.",69675,4
69675,"Not to mention, changing wallets doesn't bother me.",69675,4
69675,I know some people like to keep their wallets for years.,69675,4
69675,I used to be one of those people  :),69675,4
69676,"Very pretty bracelet, but i'm not sure that this is solid sterling silver because it's weight and price even tho its advertise as such.",69676,4
69676,"I've had mine for a week, wash my hands a lot and shower with it and still looks very nice not discoloring at all.",69676,4
69676,"I gave it 4 stars because of that, otherwise very pretty.",69676,4
69677,Very cute- especially the boyleg bottom.,69677,4
69678,Not sure how it was received as it was a gift and have not heard back yet from recipient.,69678,4
69679,I needed a waterproof glove that kept the cold melting snow from my fingers and I found it!,69679,4
69679,At a great cost.,69679,4
69679,"There are so many options out there for snow gloves, but trying to find the features you want can be a daunting job.",69679,4
69679,"My original search was for gortex, but only seeing what i wanted at the ski shops, i decided to try mountain made.",69679,4
69679,These gloves came on time and were the perfect fit.,69679,4
69679,I slid them on and fingers fit nicely.,69679,4
69679,"I Ordered and XL and maybe should have order a L, but they worked well.",69679,4
69679,I tried them out the next day on the slopes and my hands stayed dry and warm.,69679,4
69679,"The fleece liner did cause my hands to sweat a tiny bit, but, the wetness was NOT because of the snow which was my primary concern.",69679,4
69679,A nice feature is the small pocket for the hand warmers .,69679,4
69679,"i didn't use it, but when i need it, it will be there.",69679,4
69679,No need for liners in this glove.,69679,4
69680,"Very nice dress, just not long enough.",69680,4
69682,Great necklace for the price!,69682,4
69683,"Sleeves a bit short, but otherwise I received endless compliments for this high-fashion look on a budget!",69683,4
69684,Looks better in person!,69684,4
69684,can't wait to wear it for halloween!,69684,4
69685,Cute but runs a lil small.,69685,4
69686,I love the way these shoes look and my son is happy to wear them to his baseball games.,69686,4
69686,I have to really loosen up the laces to get them on.,69686,4
69686,"I wish they were just a little bit wider, but overall they fit well.",69686,4
69686,I'm happy with the purchase.,69686,4
69689,I have 2 of these shirts in 2 different colors and bought the red one to wear over Christmas.,69689,4
69689,"They fit wel, nice and long,l and are comfortable.",69689,4
69689,"The only downside is the collar and the buttons and how they lay (or don't lay) sometimes, can look funny.",69689,4
69689,They can look dressier because of the ruffled collar or you can wear with jeans.,69689,4
69689,"For the price, this is a nice go-to shirt.",69689,4
69689,Make sure to use Static Guard before wearing as static cling is a problem in the winter!,69689,4
69690,nice hat nice and light.,69690,4
69691,I wanted glasses that block out the sun and also block people from looking into my eyes.,69691,4
69691,These get the trick done.,69691,4
69691,"However, I can sometimes see my reflection on the inside of the glasses.",69691,4
69692,These were bought as a birthday gift for my daughter.,69692,4
69692,"She hates shoes with laces but we usually have a hard time finding slide on shoes that stay on her feet, but these fit really well.",69692,4
69692,They charge quickly although I do wish that they would stay charged for a little longer.,69692,4
69693,I am 5'8 and wear a size medium 8-10 depending on the cut.,69693,4
69693,16 looks good it's a little large but I use it for work and it looks fine.,69693,4
69693,I do have broad shoulders that accommodate the larger size,69693,4
69695,This bathing suit was so cute and I got many compliments.,69695,4
69695,"It is a little thin, therefore sometimes the sides of the bottom would roll up and the top was a little small.",69695,4
69695,"If you have an hourglass shape, ask the seller to give you a bigger size in either the top or bottom.",69695,4
69695,"To help you pick a size here are my stats: 28 in waist, 36 in bust, 40 in hips",69695,4
69696,"Bought these for my daughter, she loves them.",69696,4
69696,One of the studs has already fallen off though.,69696,4
69696,I don't think I would purchase these again.,69696,4
69697,"Very thin material, will need to wear a slip underneath, but very comfortable.",69697,4
69698,Material is real nice.,69698,4
69698,Plenty of pockets but definitely runs small.,69698,4
69698,"I usually wear 31x34,  I got the 32x34 and they were still small.",69698,4
69699,"Got this for a gift, she liked it.",69699,4
69699,I would have liked it better  without the 3D.,69699,4
69700,Great disposable lake sunglasses.,69700,4
69700,I have 5 pairs of these (had 6).,69700,4
69700,No huge loss if the sink to the bottom or an inebriated friend sits on them.,69700,4
69700,I always have a spair.,69700,4
69700,"Great deal, fit nice, look good.",69700,4
69701,"Very nice,worn for daughter's wedding!",69701,4
69701,"Good quality,nice fabric and pattern.",69701,4
69702,For the price the quality is fine and you don't feel that bad if you lose a pair.,69702,4
69702,The only note is that the sizing was not very consistent.,69702,4
69702,There were a couple pairs a little small and then a couple pairs that are big.,69702,4
69702,"But it's not necessarily a bad thing, because now we have a couple pairs for our child to grow into.",69702,4
69702,Added a picture to show the size difference between the pairs.,69702,4
69702,We bought these for a 2 year old and I think only the top left pair was too small.,69702,4
69704,I love these wings!,69704,4
69704,My only criticism is in regards to the finger loops.,69704,4
69704,"I don't consider myself to have extraordinarily large fingers, but I had to wear the loops on my pinkies and still had to readjust them every now and then as they felt constricting.",69704,4
69704,"Also, I have a toddler so that requires picking her up and putting her down and in the process of doing so one of the finger loops ripped off.",69704,4
69704,"An easy sewing fix, but I feel still worth mentioning.",69704,4
69705,Does what it says.,69705,4
69708,A lovely little bonnet.,69708,4
69708,Does my granddaughter have a big head??,69708,4
69708,"Even with just the slightest wispy layer of baby-fine hair, her head seems a bit big for this bonnet, which I got her for her first birthday.",69708,4
69708,"Well, big heads do run in my family.",69708,4
69708,Maybe it's not the bonnet's fault.,69708,4
69709,True to size for natural busty/ small frame women,69709,4
69710,"For how cheap it was, it did its job.",69710,4
69711,"I really like the shirt, but it is the worthless ""normal"" XXL.",69711,4
69711,"Good lord, do people really have waists that big??",69711,4
69711,"I need XXL for chest and shoulders, but have a 36 inch waist.",69711,4
69711,This has more fabric around the waist then the sails of a 19th century frigate .,69711,4
69712,This would have deserved a 5 star if it would fit true to size.,69712,4
69712,I had to go a size up.,69712,4
69712,I love how sporty and chic it looks.,69712,4
69712,It's also conservative with just a little tease.,69712,4
69713,order 1 size up in order to fit comfortably,69713,4
69714,Somewhat small but very cute,69714,4
69715,"This is a nice, well-made sun hat.",69715,4
69715,The wide brim & dark color just didn't work for me,69715,4
69716,I like this product.,69716,4
69717,This is a nice robe.,69717,4
69717,"The viscose fabric is quite slinky and stretchy, more like fabric for a nightgown and not a lightweight absorbent robe to wear at the gym pool (what I was aiming for).",69717,4
69717,I wear a women's 2X and the mens XXXL barely closes.,69717,4
69717,"If I walk or sit down, the bottom half comes wide open.",69717,4
69718,Bought for my daughter in law for Christmas...she loves it.,69718,4
69719,"Good quality, neck area is more loose than ideal,",69719,4
69721,"This is my first waist trainer, and i am pretty pleased with this.",69721,4
69721,"I have a short torso, and I like how long this trainer is because it covers my love handles which is my big problem area.",69721,4
69721,"Considering it is long, it will ride up slightly when you sit.",69721,4
69721,"It is made of a thick material, and claims to have more steel boning than just 4.",69721,4
69721,"Now, this will most definitely suck you in, and flatten your stomach, but I do not feel it has a very hourglass shape to this cincher.",69721,4
69721,"I personally have a more hourglass shape than this shaper offers, but I am keeping it to compress my love handles.",69721,4
69721,"So overall, i do think this is a good trainer for the price.",69721,4
69721,I'm sure you could get one with a smaller waist area if you spend more cash.,69721,4
69721,"I have a 26"" waist.",69721,4
69721,I am 5'3 and 118 pounds.,69721,4
69721,I purchased a small.,69721,4
69721,I am on the second row of clips on the second day.,69721,4
69722,I've had one in the past and liked the convenience of being able to just carry the ID holder with one card and a bill in it and leave the other part of the wallet in the car.,69722,4
69722,This on is much stiffer than the last one.,69722,4
69722,It's a tighter fit for cards and for the ID holder in its pocket.,69722,4
69722,I think it just needs to be broke in.,69722,4
69723,I bought this for my mom and she loves it.,69723,4
69724,"Anything wrong was with my body, not with the pants hahah.",69724,4
69724,"I get the comment ""what up Tron"" from co-workers.",69724,4
69724,I like them a lot.,69724,4
69724,They are very comfortable for me.,69724,4
69725,Not super high capacity but good quality.,69725,4
69725,Knocked a star off for having slightly less high qual zipper compared to rest of bag.,69725,4
69725,"Still works, just not super smooth.",69725,4
69726,Second pair ordered for our son.,69726,4
69726,"Very light, comfortable and affordable.",69726,4
69727,But it's so painful to get in and my ear was swollen from trying so much.,69727,4
69727,But after the swelling went town it was very cute lol,69727,4
69728,"DH said it was too tight, but I thought it looked good and I got a lot of compliments when I wore it.",69728,4
69728,I think if there were a larger size it would be too big on me.,69728,4
69728,"Fortunately, I didn't notice the strong smell others mentioned.",69728,4
69728,"It did hang in my closet for a month before I wore it, so maybe it aired out.",69728,4
69728,"Hope it looks good after I wash it, though... we'll see.",69728,4
69729,This surprising actually helped me lose weight if anything.,69729,4
69729,it also controlled my eating and I would sweat more around the mid section as well during workouts.,69729,4
69729,I used it so often I ended up cracking the plastic bars inside.,69729,4
69729,I wore this during sleeping (6+ hours) and it was comfortable.,69729,4
69729,Took it off and saw a difference.,69729,4
69729,After coming home from class I would wear it during low intensity cardio and only during sleeping.,69729,4
69729,Saw much progress and was able to get down to the last clip.,69729,4
69729,"As far as seeing curves, not much of a difference.",69729,4
69729,But did help flatten stomach.,69729,4
69730,"The bag is nice, and simple.",69730,4
69730,I consider it small-medium sized when unfolded.,69730,4
69730,The exterior pocket in the photo also serves as the pouch to fold the bag in when not in use.,69730,4
69730,"There also 2 small pockets on the outside, and another zippered pocket on the inside.",69730,4
69731,Its nice and very warm!,69731,4
69731,"a little big, but a little too small to be slouchy but still nice",69731,4
69732,I bought this item for my daughters graduation from kindergarten.,69732,4
69732,I ordered it somewhat last minute but got it in perfect time!,69732,4
69732,It fit a bit big but better bigger than smaller.,69732,4
69734,Fit well for me being a 38dd right now I had to order a xlarge to fit right.,69734,4
69734,"The padding drove me crazy because it keep moving, so I took them out.",69734,4
69735,Fits great and is really cute!,69735,4
69735,The material is a little silly so the hood doesn't stay on very well.,69735,4
69737,Dress it up or down.,69737,4
69738,"Great shirt, was a gift for my father.",69738,4
69739,I like It Is Good quality I'm normally medium but I order XL and fits perfectly!,69739,4
69740,I had to return it.,69740,4
69740,Should have gotten a small which is what i usually wear in women's but i listened to reviews saying order up.,69740,4
69740,It was really cute and the company was willing to take it back.,69740,4
69740,It was  hassel free and now knowing the sizes I  would have no problem ordering  something else from this company in the future,69740,4
69741,Fits a bit small but looks good,69741,4
69742,"I like that they're a little funky, but not in your face.",69742,4
69742,I typically wear a size 8.5 in women's shoes and the kids size 6 fit perfect.,69742,4
69742,If it weren't for the complete lack of arch support (which is very typical of Converse shoes) I would have given them a 5 star review!,69742,4
69745,Runs small...I wear a size 12-14 and had to order a 4x.,69745,4
69746,Bought as a gift for the new driver in our family.,69746,4
69746,She really loved it.,69746,4
69747,I love the style of this top.,69747,4
69747,It looks awesome with leggings and maxi skirts!,69747,4
69747,Washes well and doe snot wrinkle.,69747,4
69747,It is a bit thin so I do have to wear a cami underneath.,69747,4
69748,Size runs small and I meant to order silver but somehow ordered red.,69748,4
69749,"There are pros and cons with this, but since I read many of the reviews before I ordered this, I felt educated and was willing to take the chance.",69749,4
69749,"Again, since I read the reviews I knew to size up.",69749,4
69749,"I ordered the 29Grey style  in an extra large, even though I am an average size 6 and only 5'2"".",69749,4
69749,The XL fit me like a size 6 would (so I would say the the XL equals a US size 6 ~ my opinion only).,69749,4
69749,"As for the material, it is more of a thin sweatshirt type material, not a sweater, and the colors are different - it is a very dark blue almost looks black and grey and almost seems like they are stamped on but yet not; strange, but these things were stated in reviews that I'd read so it was expected.",69749,4
69749,(I will update material once I run it through a full wash/dry cycle.),69749,4
69749,"Also, I did want to note how quickly I received this item...I was expecting to have to wait 2-3 weeks, but it came in about a week, so that was cool.",69749,4
69749,"Overall, I've worn this with an outfit similar to the model photo and it looks cute and stylish.",69749,4
69749,"If I came across this at the mall, I'd spend 20 bucks on it.",69749,4
69752,"Inside of most of the socks was nice, a couple of them had very loose yard that got hung on toes.",69752,4
69752,The other socks are so comfortable..,69752,4
69754,"Beautiful dress, but the material is thinner than I thought it would be.",69754,4
69754,So I haven't worn it yet.,69754,4
69754,"It's not terribly thin, but because its a soft cotton type material, it clings and you can't wear spanx underneath.",69754,4
69755,Gave as a gift,69755,4
69756,Got these for my almost 4 year old.,69756,4
69756,"He loves them, says they're ""cool""!",69756,4
69757,the ring looks beautiful yet i am not pleased,69757,4
69758,A bit too large but BEAUTIFUL,69758,4
69760,I saw this exact jumpsuit on a more expensive website.,69760,4
69760,Fits well and is a great price for a casual outfit.,69760,4
69761,just what I needed for Derby Day Party.,69761,4
69762,Fits a bit small but workable.,69762,4
69762,"These gloves are VERY warm, and what I expected in quality.",69762,4
69763,Bought these to wear in an outdoor wedding.,69763,4
69763,I had no problem walking in my heels with these protectors.,69763,4
69763,I did end up putting a hole in one while dancing later in the evening but otherwise a good buy.,69763,4
69764,The wife is very pleased with her purchase.,69764,4
69764,Wash well wear well,69764,4
69765,"shorts arrived on time, fit was as expected and color scheme and material were up to my standards.",69765,4
69766,I bought this for Christmas for my 2 1/2 year old.,69766,4
69766,It is made well with heavy duty elastic.,69766,4
69766,"Since the wooden beads could be a chocking hazard, I don't recommend until your child is old enough to not try to break the elastic and put the beads in their mouth.",69766,4
69766,"Because of this, I'm waiting a little longer to let her wear.",69766,4
69766,It is a lovely gift for older children.,69766,4
69767,Cute but don't know how long they're made to last,69767,4
69768,It was the perfect gift!,69768,4
69769,Great fitting quality hat.,69769,4
69769,"Like most mentioned, the tying of the string is a little in the way.",69769,4
69770,I like that this product fits nice and sunggle.,69770,4
69770,Its not too tight or too loose.,69770,4
69770,You can't tell if you wear it under clothes.,69770,4
69770,I had 3 people this morning ask me if I have lost weight and its only my 1st day wearing it.,69770,4
69770,I guest it really does hide my stomach area good.,69770,4
69770,I recomend it for anyone.,69770,4
69771,"My son loves these and looks cute as a button snuggling in them
 Soft and comfortable",69771,4
69772,I actually use this with a front pocket wallet.,69772,4
69772,The wallet is the perfect size for credit cards but getting the money in and out of a little pocket sucked.,69772,4
69772,I put this around the whole thing.,69772,4
69772,The carbon fiber looked cool on the black wallet and I can easily manage my money now.,69772,4
69773,"It's a bit snug, but I'm hoping more use will stretch it out.",69773,4
69773,Otherwise it's really pretty and fits in my shoulder bag easily when I'm not using it.,69773,4
69774,These a good basic pair of water shoes.,69774,4
69774,My daughter wears a 7 in sneakers and regular shoes so I bought the 7M for this shoe and it fits her perfectly.,69774,4
69774,We use these for water play days at pre-school and I expect them to last the rest of the summer without an issue.,69774,4
69774,"For more daily or more often use, I prefer our Children's place water shoes.",69774,4
69774,The one downside to this shoe versus the Children's place shoe is that this shoe doesn't have a velcro strap or any tightening mechanism.,69774,4
69774,I prefer some way to tighten/strap/fasten the shoe because it gives us some flexibility to help the shoe fit better and last longer (she can wear it a little big at first).,69774,4
69774,But overall I'm pleased with these shoes.,69774,4
69774,They had no odor and they dry quickly enough so as not to mold after use.,69774,4
69774,I would purchase these again for backup water shoes.,69774,4
69775,i like it but way too big,69775,4
69776,"Very nice, but  very small.",69776,4
69776,Had to give it to my daughter.,69776,4
69777,"Runs big, goes ~6"" past hip or so...",69777,4
69778,A little small around the hip area but I love the print.,69778,4
69778,Very pretty top for spring!,69778,4
69779,I bought them for myself.,69779,4
69779,"I have a small heart shaped face and they fit me well and suit me, even though they are men's glasses.",69779,4
69780,Bought for when granddaughter spends the night.,69780,4
69780,Seems a little small.,69780,4
69781,These are very comfortable and fit well.,69781,4
69781,"However, I ordered the brown and they almost look black because they're so dark.",69781,4
69781,Nothing like the picture advertised so unfortunately my hunt continues.,69781,4
69782,I know it's meant to be tight but I would prefer a tiny bit more room.,69782,4
69783,It fit large but other than that the qualy is great,69783,4
69785,Beautiful Dress- looks just like the picture!,69785,4
69785,I ordered a XXL and it was still a bit snug in the chest.,69785,4
69785,(I'm 5'5'' usually size 16-18),69785,4
69786,"The reviews all said this dress ran small, so I got a large instead of a medium and it worked perfect!",69786,4
69787,It gets caught on things so I couldn't really wear it long.,69787,4
69787,But it is perfect for sandals or flip flops.,69787,4
69788,I like the way it fits.,69788,4
69789,I'm glad this product exists.,69789,4
69789,I hate when my purses get saggy on me.,69789,4
69789,I only have a few issues with it.,69789,4
69789,"First, it arrived with a bunch of scratches on it.",69789,4
69789,"This isn't that big of a problem since it won't really be seen by anyone, but it's just kind of one of those off putting things since I expected a nice, clear product.",69789,4
69789,"Secondly, things keep getting under the shaper in my purse, so it constantly traps my lipgloss and pens to the bottom of my purse.",69789,4
69789,Maybe the product could be better sized so that this doesn't happen?,69789,4
69789,Just a few small things I don't like that are worth noting.,69789,4
69793,"I'm 5' 5.5"" and 120 lbs, this is cute but the top part is a little small on my chest.",69793,4
69794,"Nice Hoodie, a little small better to buy one size bigger.",69794,4
69794,My son likes it very much.,69794,4
69796,I bought this product to bring with me to work and hold all of my junk.,69796,4
69796,"I usually carry a 15"" laptop, my lunch, my keys, my wallet, and some random thing such as a pack of gel pens or a book.",69796,4
69796,"I read some reviews pointing out that this backpack was really big, but was lacking in compartments (such as a place to separate my items into pockets).",69796,4
69796,"This backpack is great if you want to carry everything in one huge black hole, and want to sift through things.",69796,4
69796,"I love the bag, but I wish it had more pockets or a separator.",69796,4
69796,I've taken a picture of the one small pocket it has that also has another pocket on the pocket for a cellphone.,69796,4
69797,Light weight great for Floridas hot rainy days,69797,4
69798,Like however needed to stretch both out - not as slouchy as expected....,69798,4
69799,Soft and compfortable material yet seems like good quality.,69799,4
69800,This is a great deal 30$ about for 6 pairs of pants.,69800,4
69800,They were a little too big mostly just because I'm only 5'1 and skinny but they fit well enough that they're still comfortable to wear and I still like my purchase a lot.,69800,4
69801,Product didn't work out for me but this company was wonderful and reached out to refund me my money.,69801,4
69802,"I though it would have a lot more space inside, but it's A cute bag & it's very light weight (-:",69802,4
69803,Beautiful shoes just missing a 1/2 size bigger thats all.,69803,4
69804,"It is a nice suit, looks good on, made of soft, comfortable material.",69804,4
69804,"I wear a 34dd and the top is too wide around, but needs to be the size I ordered to cover everything.",69804,4
69805,"The images are very clear, I love that.",69805,4
69805,"It's little thin though, I wish it was thicker, its a little see-through, but not too bad.",69805,4
69807,"I love the idea behind the design; It is sensible and just perfect for children in a cold winter day, but the size is relatively too large considering the fact  that this is meant for little kids.",69807,4
69807,"I would give it 5 stars for smart idea and beautiful design and proper execution, but the one size for all makes it almost senseless for my daughter.",69807,4
69808,"nice, but returned it because we decided on something else.",69808,4
69809,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dearlove-Lady-See-Through-Bias-cut-Mesh-Illusion-Cross-Sexy-Lingerie-Gown-LC6125-B1-XS/dp/B01D2ZNIFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dearlove Lady See Through Bias-cut Mesh Illusion Cross Sexy Lingerie Gown(LC6125-B1-XS)</a>
Dearlove Lady See Through Bias-cut Mesh Illusion Cross Sexy Lingerie Gown
 I have been looking for a classing long lingerie piece to add to my collection, and when I came across this one on Amazon, I decided to give it a try.",69809,4
69809,"Pros:
High quality
Sexy but not tacky
True to size
Soft and comfortable
Unique design
Cons:
Could be too short for taller ladies
  I am 5'3"" 115 lb.",69809,4
69809,"Moreover, I got the xs size, and it fit tight to my body and hit my at the lower ankles
Had weird shoulder straps
  I ended up tieing they so that they cross crossed in the back instead of going right or my shoulders
G-string was too tight around hips and weird and puffy in the crotch area
  Not a huge problem I wore it with one I already owned
Overall this is beautiful and unique lingerie piece and is worth the low price.",69809,4
69809,I recommended this it is very flattering for all body types.,69809,4
69810,Its a nice necklace.,69810,4
69810,It arrived in time and in great condition.,69810,4
69810,"It is a one dimensional earring, so it becomes weird when you turn your face or someone from behind sees you.",69810,4
69810,"It is not an earring that I can use all the time, but really nice colors and design.",69810,4
69810,An interesting earring and not that expensive.,69810,4
69811,"small fits like xs, great for my 13 yr thini daughter",69811,4
69812,"Beautiful necklace-didn't come broken or tarnished, but it came in silver and I ordered it in gold",69812,4
69813,Great ring to verify wearer's mood and like that it is adjustable.,69813,4
69813,It also has subtle sparkle in stone-very attractive.,69813,4
69813,My only difficulty is that each hind foot of turtle has a small sharp spike which tends to get caught on material.,69813,4
69813,I had a mood ring in the past but stone had fallen out after multiple wearings--glued stone failed to function anymore.,69813,4
69814,Came just like the picture showed,69814,4
69815,Just received my new tote.,69815,4
69815,"I have plenty of totes, but non of them were with pockets and especially two side pockets one for water bottle and the other for coffee traveling mug.",69815,4
69815,"Handles/straps feel so soft, don't dig into shoulders as they are very wide.",69815,4
69815,"It fits 5 notebooks, 2 large folders, iPad.",69815,4
69815,Female essence and still does not get bulky.,69815,4
69815,I can't wait to start receiving complements on my new tote tomorrow at my college.,69815,4
69816,"Dress is nice,  but I  think I'm sending it back for a size  up,  i'm  normally a medium though",69816,4
69818,"The only reason I am not giving 5 stars on this suit is because when you tie the top, the straps in the front that cross on your chest, ride up with a little bit of a choking effect.",69818,4
69818,I just sewed the front straps where I was comfortable with them.,69818,4
69818,The suit fits pretty spot on from the size chart and reviews.,69818,4
69818,I am 5'2 and an athletic 135 pounds.,69818,4
69818,I bought a Large.,69818,4
69818,Bottoms fit great and are not too skimpy compared to most swimsuits I've bought online.,69818,4
69818,The top is a little more revealing than I anticipated and in the picture but I like it overall.,69818,4
69819,I bought this to use on my first trip traveling out of the country.,69819,4
69819,"My sibling bought a different brand and style, before the trip was over she was admiring mine even though Hers was elegant in nature, mine was perfect!",69819,4
69819,I researched extensively before I purchased this pack in the reviews were right on.,69819,4
69819,I could fit so much in here and love the different pockets.,69819,4
69819,Glad I picked this one!,69819,4
69819,The only thing I would change is they were out of the color I wanted but this one is a very pretty color.,69819,4
69820,"Very cute, I bought & love this for the hoodie part.",69820,4
69820,The material is also nice.,69820,4
69820,I went up a size per the size chart and it fit perfectly.,69820,4
69820,"I just wish I got the black or gray instead...I guess I felt daring the day I ordered the red, which turned out to be more of a hot coral color.",69820,4
69820,Which is fine if that's your thing :),69820,4
69821,Love them a little big but super cute and comfortable,69821,4
69822,Not the best quality but considering the price it is worth it,69822,4
69823,They look nice and fit well!,69823,4
69824,I bought  this hoodie as a gift but decided to keep for my self.,69824,4
69824,It hugs the body and keeps me warm especially around the neck.,69824,4
69824,"It has nice small leather detailing at the pockets, hem and on the back.",69824,4
69824,I would have paid for a little better knit material.,69824,4
69824,All and all I like it lots.,69824,4
69824,I am 71 yrs old so it is not just for younger women.,69824,4
69825,"Very nice material, clearly a quality dress.",69825,4
69825,"I'm 5'5 120lb with A cups and the S was passable, but since the dress (solid color) was so stretchy, it fit much better as an XS.",69825,4
69826,Fits a bit large but still attractive,69826,4
69828,Happy looks good and good quality,69828,4
69829,"Very cute, but the picture makes it appear red, but I got a hot pink one.",69829,4
69829,"I was hoping it wa red to wear on Christmas Eve, but luckily I do love pink as well....",69829,4

69834,Item was delivered on time and as described,69834,4
69835,The size was somewhat larger then I needed but it is fine.,69835,4
69835,I ordered a larger size due to some of the reviews.,69835,4
69835,It is a very nice warm cape that will go with many outfits.,69835,4
69835,Also it is a pretty medium blue.,69835,4
69836,needs to be washed before worn,69836,4
69837,I was impressed with the quick delivery.,69837,4
69837,The quality was good.,69837,4
69837,They were a little wider than I expected.,69837,4
69837,I expected a more skinnier tie.,69837,4
69837,I bought them for Christmas gifts.,69837,4
69837,I broke them in to 3 different gifts.,69837,4
69838,Cute fit on the bottoms but the top is tiiiiny.,69838,4
69838,I ordered 2 sizes up and the bottoms fit well but the top is tiny for my boobies.,69838,4
69838,"I wear a 2-4, top 34 D, ordered a large.",69838,4
69839,My daughter is 9 and we ordered a size 3.,69839,4
69839,Love the support and durability of the soles as she is extremely rough on her shoes.,69839,4
69839,"With that said, the color is beautiful for spring but by the first day on the playground at school (rubber tire base) they were visibly dirty.",69839,4
69839,I'm battling keeping the peach color clean daily but they are worth it.,69839,4
69839,Great shoe so far!,69839,4
69840,great ring and great price,69840,4
69841,This kilt is nicer then I thought for just getting into wearing of kilts.,69841,4
69841,"Yes there is a great deal room, not pants that are constricting, free flowing.",69841,4
69842,"It is everything it was advertised to be and I really like it but I'm always wishing I could have a wallet that held all that this one does, but is just a wee bit smaller.",69842,4
69842,"I think I'm hoping for an impossibility, so maybe I'll ask Santa Clause.",69842,4
69842,A great product though,69842,4
69843,Theses are your basic white t-shirts and as such fit just fine and ate of quality material.,69843,4
69843,Nothing truly bad or standout.,69843,4
69844,"Chain is of good quality, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the circle piece where the multiple chains hang on is not the same quality as the rest of it.",69844,4
69844,Have not had any issues with it and it's looks fantastic!,69844,4
69845,Pretty large but it works perfectly,69845,4
69846,Only negative for me is that the lining is plastic.,69846,4
69847,I am loving it!!!,69847,4
69847,Such a perfect fit.,69847,4
69848,Ulla Pollen for the win again.,69848,4
69848,"Nice fit, colors match photo.",69848,4
69848,"Not dressy enough for work (it is a tshirt), but cute for very casual wear.",69848,4
69849,I was a little skeptical when I opened the box.,69849,4
69849,"The dress arrived wrinkled, but with so many great reviews, I decided to give it a chance.",69849,4
69849,Once I put it on (with a crinoline) I was amazed!,69849,4
69849,"The dress stretched to fit my bust, fit snugly through the waist and flared perfectly at the hips.",69849,4
69849,"Received so many compliments at our schools 50s themed,end-of-year party.",69849,4
69849,"If you're looking for a dress that's flattering yet demure, look no further.",69849,4
69849,"Be sure to steam it before wearing to get those out wrinkles, though!",69849,4
69850,It's cute but sat on me super weird.,69850,4
69851,I bought XL  because I am a 36D.,69851,4
69851,I bought for mild support and some thin padding.,69851,4
69851,I would say XL is probably more for a size 34D and absolutely no larger.,69851,4
69851,"However, the bras are a great price as made well and comfortable",69851,4
69852,Buy a size larger...,69852,4
69853,Nice for the price really dark great for outdoors activities..,69853,4
69853,They are plastic so don't expect a superior build just wear  um.,69853,4
69853,They are UV compliant.,69853,4
69854,It needs a bit more lenght.,69854,4
69855,"This was nice, small and dainty yet long enough to reach to about right below my rib cage.",69855,4
69855,"The pearl on the end is very small, so don't purchase this if you are looking for a large statement necklace.",69855,4
69855,"Overall though, this fits what I was looking for!",69855,4
69856,Super cute for the price.,69856,4
69857,I would buy again,69857,4
69858,A little more space between checks and register for a pen would be nice.,69858,4
69859,A bit on the short side.,69859,4
69860,great photo bomb hat,69860,4
69861,These are very stylish dress pants.,69861,4
69861,"I'm 6' and 300 pounds so my thighs aren't exactly small, but these do fit a slimmer than other brands.",69861,4
69861,I certainly like them and get plenty of compliments.,69861,4
69861,The color is also just what I was looking for.,69861,4
69862,"Good quality, I didn't realize this jacket is reversible so I was delighted to find I could switch it to the red underside.",69862,4
69863,Okay guys my husband is a 34 in the waist.,69863,4
69863,BY ALL THAT IS HOLY why would he order a 40?,69863,4
69863,Because the reviews are misleading or the sizing varies all over the place on these kilts.,69863,4
69863,It was of course to big.,69863,4
69863,So we washed it.,69863,4
69863,It shrank considerably but I will alter it only about an inch and a quarter on the side.,69863,4
69863,"He is a 34"" next time I will be ordering a 36"" just to give a little room if he puts on a little weight.",69863,4
69863,Use your pants size and go up an inch or two.,69863,4
69863,If you have a beer lovers gut you may want to take that into consideration too.,69863,4
69865,Wasn't expecting much for the price but whoa these are classy looking and very interesting from the back and bonus arrived earlier than expected!,69865,4
69865,Obviously this is meant for funzies they've no support and you can't be all that well endowed I think they're only good for A or B cup I wear 34B these are perfect!,69865,4
69865,I think you can only hand wash them and they're a bit itchy but I generally have sensitive skin with a zillion allergy unfortunately so they might not cause any problems to anyone else.,69865,4
69865,Probably dreft detergent with a hand wash would take care of those two issues I've.,69865,4
69866,"I ONLY have ONE complaint about this belt, and that is the buckle is not the exact color in the picture.",69866,4
69866,"The Silver part is darker than the picture and also has a gasoline-like color to it, but thats only noticeable when you look close.",69866,4
69866,"I also prefer a slightly thicker belt, but thats just nitpicking.",69866,4
69866,"Other than that, im SATISFIED!",69866,4
69866,The design is nice and is MUCH more fashionable than wearing a basic workers belt.,69866,4
69866,"Had this since Jan 27, 2016
I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!",69866,4
69871,I ordered up and it fits great!,69871,4
69872,Love the convenience of having these show up on my doorstep!!!!,69872,4
69872,"They were somewhat small but I managed to get them on, and work as sort of a girdle, which I need!",69872,4
69873,"Cute, looks as pictured.",69873,4
69873,I bought it to go with a black wool coat.,69873,4
69873,Seems like a good deal.,69873,4
69874,Really comfy and fits well... except if you have a butt.,69874,4
69874,The material feels great!,69874,4
69875,"The pads are more like a swim suit top pads, and the material is you get what you pay for...",69875,4
69876,"Cute, fun but did not come with batteries for the lights",69876,4
69877,It's a very useful coat as I've left the hotter climate.,69877,4
69877,But recently feathers are poking through and I've only had it for a month.,69877,4
69879,"This dress said it was cotton, but it is a thin polyester, it has the weight and feel of jacket lining.",69879,4
69879,"It's opaque though, I could wear a black slip underneath and it wouldn't show.",69879,4
69879,"It fits like a glove, and has a concealed side-zipper.",69879,4
69879,It is well made and perfect for a hot summer day.,69879,4
69879,"I'm only giving it four stars, because it did say it would be a cotton blend.",69879,4
69880,"Nice, solid clasp with some very nice leather attached.",69880,4
69880,"It feels solid and is a nice weight in your hand  Only improvement I made was attaching a key ring (bronze colored to match the snap) to the leather, then use the clip to attach to my belt loop.",69880,4
69881,"Very comfortable, would buy it again in another color if it was ever available.",69881,4
69882,"In general, I like the lightness and fit of the hat.",69882,4
69882,It kept my son's head cool in the sun and safe from burning his neck.,69882,4
69882,"The parts that could use improvement are the bill of the hat: especially when a lil damp, it flapped down over my son's eyes and he got terribly frustrated at not being able to see.",69882,4
69882,"Every time I fixed the hat for him, it would fall back down.",69882,4
69882,The second part are the strings to tie up the hat under their chin: it would be even better with a pulley string to tighten or loosen.,69882,4
69882,"In summary, keep this hat high and dry and you'll be fine.",69882,4
69882,Good luck with that!,69882,4
69883,Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.,69883,4
69883,It is a better quality than I expected.,69883,4
69883,"It's a nice medium sized bag, perfect for my 11 yo when we travel.",69883,4
69883,It would be too small for full sized products or a lot of products or tools but good if using travel sized stuff.,69883,4
69883,I'm thinking about ordering one for myself for weekend trips!,69883,4
69885,"Good but i had to fix the bottom cause it was too large but its ok now
Good material
Look like the pics
The cut might have a lil default cause its too large but its easy to fix",69885,4
69887,It's a beautiful sweater but it's shorter than I saw in the picture.,69887,4
69888,"The little Texas charm feels a little cheap, but it's super adorable.",69888,4
69889,"I am bigger at top,so it ws a oittle snug on top.",69889,4
69889,However the bottom fit perfectly.,69889,4
69889,It is a great purchase.,69889,4
69890,"Charms are nice, like the Alice drink me face more.",69890,4
69890,Nice if you collect Alice stuff.,69890,4
69891,"Will likely pill after several wears -- but being black, it won't show too much.",69891,4
69892,Very good value for price,69892,4
69893,sim to stretch out,69893,4
69894,"It's already coming apart in places, but it's easily fixed and you can't beat the price.",69894,4
69894,Made an eerie addition to a costume.,69894,4
69896,It delivers what is promises.,69896,4
69896,"The wide width easily accommodates all my lose ends, including keys, iPhone, passport, etc.",69896,4
69896,The material is thin as a single layer.,69896,4
69896,"When double up, it gives a thicker appearance.",69896,4
69897,"It's awesome, but fits a little snug!",69897,4
69897,"Still an awesome sweater , the detail is amazing, I'm still in love with this",69897,4
69898,I like the purse.,69898,4
69898,I definitely got my money's worth.,69898,4
69900,Definitely a cute top.,69900,4
69900,"Material is a bit thin, will probably need to wear a tank under it",69900,4
69901,"My son wears S and and XS kid's sizes, he is 5 y.o.",69901,4
69901,I ordered S to make sure the shirt will be long enough as he is a tall boy.,69901,4
69901,The shirt is way too big.,69901,4
69901,Feels like it is a teen S. But I love the quality.,69901,4
69901,It is exactly what I wanted as sport underwear under my son's red uniform.,69901,4
69901,I don't know maybe it's supposed to be worn just as summer shirt but the fabric is like a thin sport underwear (first layer)  Ordering one more XS size.,69901,4
69902,"Bought it for my younger sister, for school and she loves it.",69902,4
69905,Love it looks great,69905,4
69906,good for the price,69906,4
69907,It's a great buy.,69907,4
69909,Bought my normal size and the fit is fine...just not as long as i had hoped for.,69909,4
69910,I typically wear a 32D and a small fits perfectly.,69910,4
69910,Great price for good product.,69910,4
69912,This bag is very cute and stylish.,69912,4
69912,"However, for the price I wish it had more compartments inside for storage.",69912,4
69912,Other than that it's a great tote and very well made.,69912,4
69913,Super cute and comfy I love it!,69913,4
69913,I was worried about it being small and it's just a tad large.,69913,4
69915,Purchased for my grandson.,69915,4
69915,He loves to see his feet glow with every step.,69915,4
69915,The fit is nice and they are very durable.,69915,4
69915,"I like the way Spiderman reaches across the shoe to snugly strap the shoes on, in lieu of messy shoe laces.",69915,4
69915,I would have given five stars if a couple of lights were in front of the shoe as well as in back.,69915,4
69915,Having him stop every couple of steps to look at the back of his shoes glow has slowed down our walks.,69915,4
69915,It's a nice problem to have.,69915,4
69916,I wish it wouldn't roll down much but its ok.,69916,4
69916,"I've quite recently attempted them on, and they fit well however in the event that I were an inch bigger than I am now they wouldn't have.",69916,4
69916,"I got the red ones in the ""one size"" since that is the main size they had in that shading.",69916,4
69916,"They appear to be made genuinely well, they're only a squeeze smaller than I sought after.",69916,4
69916,"They don't have much give, keeping in mind in some ways that is great in light of the fact that in the event that you happen to be as large of a devotee of fishnets as I am and have claimed a few sets you have most likely possessed a couple that extended a lot throughout wearing and hang and only all around looked amusing.",69916,4
69916,"These are not super stretchy, which like I said, is great in some ways yet I'm 5'7"" and they're only somewhat short in the groin zone and I am somewhat awe-inspiring and have actually more extensive hips so simply being made a squeeze or so longer and a squeeze or so more extensive at the top would have made me a lot more content.",69916,4
69916,"Despite everything i'll wear them, just not for anything requiring huge amounts of adaptability.",69916,4
69917,"Very nice,feels soft and fits great!!",69917,4
69918,One stone fell out but it's hard to see where it's missing.,69918,4
69918,I wear the tiara to put on makeup and remind my husband (who bought it for me) that I need attention!,69918,4
69918,"Unlike most headbands that give me a headache, it's not uncomfortable and I can forget I'm wearing it which is embarrassing when my teenage boys drive up to the house.",69918,4
69920,Got this for a witch costume and it looks great.,69920,4
69920,Really good quality for the price I was suprised!,69920,4
69921,"They are soft and fit nice, but MAN what a smell.",69921,4
69921,I think it is the dye.,69921,4
69921,I am clearly going to wash them before wearing.,69921,4
69921,It is almost like a burning curry smell.,69921,4
69923,Cute dress & not too short.,69923,4
69923,It is very comfy & suitable to wear anywhere.,69923,4
69923,I am pleased w/ my purchase & would recommend it to a friend.,69923,4
69924,"Very comfortable,good quality, just a little snug for my liking.",69924,4
69925,I have enjoyed this suit!,69925,4
69925,I was in the market for a swim dress for modesty issues and feel comfortable in this one.,69925,4
69925,"It is a little big on the sides up top, but not  enough to say in fits large.",69925,4
69925,"I like how ""flowy"" it is and that you can adjust the front tie at the bust.",69925,4
69926,You would think these were made better for the price.,69926,4
69926,The seams should be double sewn.,69926,4
69928,It was very fitting for me....but in fairness I am a big guy.,69928,4
69928,"It is light and will make a wonderful summer shirt, when I can fit in it.",69928,4
69929,I bought this sweater as a Christmas gift.,69929,4
69929,It looks just as described but it does run a lot smaller than usual,69929,4
69930,"I love the leather, color, and design.",69930,4
69930,Only problem is its just a little too small (length could stand to be about 1-1.5cm longer).,69930,4
69930,"My check book and register did fit in there, but only after a lot of pushing/pulling/tugging.",69930,4
69930,I usually keep 2 check registers in my checkbook but this is definitely not big enough for that.,69930,4
69930,So even though I think the quality is 5star.,69930,4
69930,"I would rate it a 3star for appropriate sizing and a 3star for price, as I think $39 is too much to pay for a checkbook that is not 5star in every way.",69930,4
69930,"Despite that, I am still satisfied with my purchase.",69930,4
69931,Suit arrived earlier than expected and fitted as expected.,69931,4
69932,Like the fit and style.,69932,4
69932,Stands up in the wash.,69932,4
69933,Good quality but I was unable to use the ring it came with because the ball was too tight of a fit.,69933,4
69934,super cute and love the design!,69934,4
69934,not a big fan of the material only because they're not warm in the winter.,69934,4
69934,i prefer more of a cotton material.,69934,4
69934,but they're great for the price and can easly be worn over a warmer pair :D,69934,4
69935,They are fine - as expected - fluffy socks,69935,4
69936,Cute look just like the pic a little snug but it works!,69936,4
69937,only thing is some of the string was loose and falling off but ill fix it.,69937,4
69937,this is a great product and it super colorful and just zwhat i expected.,69937,4
69938,Ordered a small and cami under lace was longer than expected.,69938,4
69938,Still a very pretty shirt though.,69938,4
69939,2X fit my husband perfectly.,69939,4
69939,It's nice and light.,69939,4
69940,While in the hospital I immediately went online and ordered a pair.,69940,4
69940,My poor newborn son kept scratching his face and it broke my heart to see all his scratch marks.,69940,4
69940,During the initially uses the mittens were much too big for him and they kept falling off.,69940,4
69940,Now at 2 months they fit him much better but we also don't really need them anymore.,69940,4
69940,If you have a big baby these will work.,69940,4
69940,Our son was 6 lbs 14 oz (for reference).,69940,4
69941,"It's nice, what I expected for the money.",69941,4
69942,These are quality material and thick enough that they aren't see through.,69942,4
69942,On the negative side they do tend to roll down occasionally and fit very snug to the skin.,69942,4
69943,Works great for dance.,69943,4
69945,It was cute but a bit to big,69945,4
69946,"It was a very nice dress, really quite pretty.",69946,4
69946,But we had to have it taken up a bit in the sleeves.,69946,4
69946,It was too big on top.,69946,4
69947,They had s bit of an odor but I'm sure it will air out.,69947,4
69947,I took one star off because I got two of the same color bow.,69947,4
69948,"Too long for my torso (12"" from hip to lower breast) so am returning.",69948,4
69948,"Other than that, it fit very well and was relatively comfortable.",69948,4
69949,"They fit nicely (as expected, I am usually a large and ordered as such) and for the price they are pretty good quality.",69949,4
69949,My only negative feedback would be that they are a little thin/not very warm.,69949,4
69949,"Most yoga pants that I have bought are thicker and feel a little more supportive, which is helpful for those of us more jiggly ladies.",69949,4
69949,"That being said, I ordered these in the Black/grey ""space dye"" which was a cool color and not see through or anything, so others may be fine with the thickness level.",69949,4
69950,This purse looks way better in person!!,69950,4
69950,"It is sassy, chic, adorable.",69950,4
69950,My Edge Curve phone can't fit in though.,69950,4
69950,"Keys, lip stick, and few other small items will.",69950,4
69950,It is pretty light considering all the diamonds...,69950,4
69951,Very cute and my son loves to wear them when he pretends to be a dinosaur.,69951,4
69951,Just be very careful when choosing the size.,69951,4
69951,I measured my sons feet and shoes to be sure the size was correct.,69951,4
69951,"Then I ordered them one size larger, because I wanted to make sure that he would be able to have them for a while.",69951,4
69952,Ratchet belts are one of those ideas that was LONG over due.,69952,4
69952,What took them so long?!!?,69952,4
69952,"I buy cars with power seats not because I'm lazy, but I really like how a power seat can be put in more positions.",69952,4
69952,The same with the ratchet belt - I really like how it 'ratchets' to more lengths than a belt with holes - and the holes are seldom in the length I really want..,69952,4
69952,I got this particular belt because I like the colors and the style - not to plain and not to fancy.,69952,4
69952,The leather of the belt is a nice thickness - it seems like it will be durable.,69952,4
69952,"But it does have 3 layers, and can't tell what the middle (thickest) layer is.",69952,4
69952,"Have to take a star off for the instructions, which don't even tell u how to take it off!!",69952,4
69952,"I put it on when I opened it, and got a bit scared when  'Take it off' is not the instructions.",69952,4
69952,"Obviously I figured it out - if you have it on 'tight', you HAVE to pull it just a bit tighter to be able to use the release button/lever on the bottom of the buckle.",69952,4
69952,The instructions also don't tell you how to trim the belt to length.,69952,4
69952,"It's a simple matter of removing the buckle and cutting the belt, but...",69952,4
69952,I didn't realize how much of the belt HAS to stick out of the buckle for the first ratchet.,69952,4
69952,I added a photo of the belt at the first ratchet.,69952,4
69952,"If I gain much weight, I'll have to buy another belt!!",69952,4
69952,"Also; the end of the belt that sticks out is embossed with an apple logo and ""oxiguo"".. Dunno wut that means.",69952,4
69952,I added a pic of that too.,69952,4
69952,I like that you can mix and match belts and buckles.,69952,4
69952,"The belt came with a 15% discount code for buying more, but it's for buying from them, not from Amazon.",69952,4
69953,Very cute but way shorter than I had expected and rides up too.,69953,4
69954,"It's a little too small for me, but it fits my younger sister perfect!",69954,4
69955,daughter loves the dress.,69955,4
69956,"Runs a tad bit small, but over all its a beautiful piece.",69956,4
69956,Looks just like the picture.,69956,4
69957,I like these cute rompers.,69957,4
69957,Great purchase for the price.,69957,4
69958,I used this as a friendship lost gift to two young girls who best friend passed and they love it.,69958,4
69959,The person who I got it liked it,69959,4
69961,Excellent product and I love how thin and compact it is.,69961,4
69961,"It seems quite durable and has a very nice finish, although it is a finger print magnet.",69961,4
69961,"I use it to hold my certifications and company credit card, which it is perfect for.",69961,4
69961,I only wish the sleeves were a bit thicker.,69961,4
69961,"I can really only holder 3 business cards in one of the sleeves and it would be nice if at least the outside sleeves could hold 2 more, but it works and the small size was the most important piece for me.",69961,4
69962,"I only gave it 4 stars because I really loved this blazer, but it didn't fit.",69962,4
69962,"I bought a medium, that is my normal size for everything, I am 5'8 and my shoulders are pretty broad.",69962,4
69962,"The blazer was really nice, looked just like the advertised photo, the material was silky and felt good on the skin.",69962,4
69962,The blazers material felt strong and of good quality.,69962,4
69962,"It could have been my shoulders were too broad for this blazer, or that the blazer just runs a little small, when I put the blazer on, it felt like if I moved my arms forward I'd rip the back.",69962,4
69962,"The package came before the ETA, (Estimated Time of Arrival) [less than 2 weeks], which is really good for overseas.",69962,4
69962,"Two weeks is usually the minimum wait time, but this package came about a week after saying it was shipped.",69962,4
69963,Size medium on a 34b 120lb woman about 5'4 fit a bit weird.,69963,4
69963,The bottoms fit but we're almost a bit small.,69963,4
69963,The bikini top fit good around my ribs but the cups were a bit large.,69963,4
69963,Overall I love the colors and how it looks on.,69963,4
69964,"This wallet is fantastic, it keeps my cards tucked securely in it ( the elastic holder is key for this ) my only complaint would be the key holder is super thin and broke after only a few days.",69964,4
69964,"It may be fantastic for a backup emergency key that you rarely use, but i tried using my housekey here, and the constant 'strain' on the little strap was too much.",69964,4
69964,The wallet itself is top notch and i plan 100% to buy another.,69964,4
69965,Got lots of complements.,69965,4
69965,"Zipper is a little touchy at the waist band, I think due to the thickness of the fabric.",69965,4
69965,I'm a pretty solid size 8 and the large was just a tad bit snug.,69965,4
69965,I do wish it had pockets.,69965,4
69966,"Super cute and soft, great colors, but way too small!",69966,4
69966,I wonder if they put the wrong tag in this shirt.,69966,4
69966,"My baby girl is 2 yrs & 1 month, only 25 lbs, still wears 18 month pants.",69966,4
69966,"I got the 3T in this shirt, and it is tight!",69966,4
69967,"Somewhat smaller than I expected, mainly in the rise.",69967,4
69967,Sits very low on waist but not a big deal for me.,69967,4
69969,Love the dress but tight in the bust area,69969,4
69970,they are great but must run small they didn't fit my grandson,69970,4
69971,Well the kit worked pretty well.,69971,4
69971,Came with all of the basic pieces needed to get the job done.,69971,4
69971,Only problem I had was guiding the jewelry with the needle through the piercing.,69971,4
69971,"May cause you to feel very lightheaded, so please be very careful when doing this by yourself.",69971,4
69972,Order a size up tho,69972,4
69973,My wife loves it!,69973,4
69974,The material is slightly thinner than i expected but it isn't a bad shirt.,69974,4
69974,The print is bright and the shirt fits well.,69974,4
69974,Would buy it again.,69974,4
69975,"Purchased for my 12 yea old, fits well, great colors, she loves it.",69975,4
69976,Good quality s*** just a little bit small glad I ordered a Xxl instead of the xl so it fits nice,69976,4
69977,"This blouse fits great, but only because I ordered a size larger based on others reviews.",69977,4
69978,I really like this style of Spanx.,69978,4
69978,"It's like underwear that flattens your tummy, and is pretty comfortable.",69978,4
69979,Great for my 12 year old daughter for Halloween!,69979,4
69980,Very slim profile wallet that holds all of my cards and a few bills.,69980,4
69980,It's slim enough to place in my front pockets.,69980,4
69981,Super cute but runs large!,69981,4
69981,I just had a baby and the medium was still too large for me.,69981,4
69981,I would suggest ordering a size smaller.,69981,4
69981,Material is nice and thin but not a cheap kind of thin.,69981,4
69981,Perfect for a hot climate.,69981,4
69982,These are the 4th brand of these types of liners/socks that I have tried and they are by far the best!,69982,4
69982,All of the other brands I got from Target and they all slipped off my heels almost immediately.,69982,4
69982,The most expensive pair (from champion) fell off the fastest.,69982,4
69982,I'm only giving these 4 stars because ONCE I did have to put the sock on my right foot back on.,69982,4
69982,But that was over an hour after wearing them!,69982,4
69982,"And to be fair, my right foot is smaller than my left foot, so that's not surprising.",69982,4
69982,These socks/liners are probably twice the thickness of any of the other brands I've tried.,69982,4
69982,I could tell that before putting them on.,69982,4
69982,Love the bright colors and am so happy to have finally found a sock/liner that works so I can wear my cute new shoes!,69982,4
69983,kids love them They where a hit at a party we went to......,69983,4
69984,I previously bought one in blue for a job interview and I got a job!,69984,4
69984,"Just buy two sizes up, wash it, iron it over a wet cloth, and hang it.",69984,4
69984,For the price it is great.,69984,4
69984,I get that some people get a damaged button but it's not too difficult to replace.,69984,4
69984,I bought another blue one for a family member so I would recommend it.,69984,4
69984,It comes fast too.,69984,4
69985,These jersey's are meant to be snug.,69985,4
69985,"It does run small, so at the advise of other reviews I ordered up 1 size from what I normally wear.",69985,4
69985,"I'm 5-11, 160lbs and a medium firs pretty spot on.",69985,4
69985,"It's no high end jersey, but for this price, it seems to be better made than I expected.",69985,4
69985,"I wish they had other colors, so I could buy more.",69985,4
69987,The description and photo are accurate representations of the skirt.,69987,4
69988,"Bought this as a gift for a kid - it's okay, but not as nice as another I bought for myself.",69988,4
69988,"I would definitely recommend it for the price, especially for a kid/teen.",69988,4
69989,"Feel great, seem to hold up to washing, wish they were longer.",69989,4
69991,"Stiff leather, but beautiful wallet, matches purse perfectly!",69991,4
69992,My only thing was it was more see through than expected.,69992,4
69992,I already own the grey and love it.,69992,4
69992,I'll probably just dye this one and keep it.,69992,4
69993,"I like the dress, but I had to order 2 sizes up for the fit, and I am usually a M-L",69993,4
69994,I really like it super cute!,69994,4
69994,"They only had a large when I ordered it and it was only $16.00 great price!, but that's ok it's a costume so I'm glad it's not super tight!",69994,4
69994,Over all good quality and worth it!,69994,4
69995,"The pouch is too small to hold your package, other than that they are OK.",69995,4
69997,"The t-shirt size M is somewhat large, anyway it is a great product and great service",69997,4
69998,"This is great, does the job...not right enough though so it doesn't hold in much more than a really tight ribbed stretch top.",69998,4
69998,If they had a size smaller them it might be better.,69998,4
69998,I wear pre pregnancy 6 in women and 9 in junior...I ordered the small and it was not tight enough.,69998,4
69999,Very pretty just a lil small in the boob area,69999,4
70000,I bought this 2 sizes up and it fits great.,70000,4
70000,I am going to buy it in another color.,70000,4
70001,I've had to fix it several times on some of the larger loops because they stretched just enough that the other end that's linked to it snaked out.,70001,4
70001,But otherwise its super pretty and I really like that its a larger size!,70001,4
70002,This was actually a really nice top.,70002,4
70002,I returned it only because it did not look good with my figure.,70002,4
70002,"So I can't say in the long run how it is, but just touching the material and looking at the top it was cute :)",70002,4
70004,It is too large for my daughter who wears size 5 or 6 but she will grow into it.,70004,4
70005,Pretty dress but a little long.,70005,4
70005,I've seen this dress many times on online boutique stores and have wanted it for a while but the price was always too high.,70005,4
70005,So this is a great buy for under $20.,70005,4
70005,I love the colors and the fit.,70005,4
70005,I'm 160 lbs and I normally wear a size 8/10.,70005,4
70005,I ordered a large and it fits fine.,70005,4
70005,"I'm 5'4"" so I'll have to have it altered if I wish to wear it with flats.",70005,4
70005,"Plus I knew it was a sheer dress, but in light it's REALLY sheer.",70005,4
70005,I'll probably wear an additional slip.,70005,4
70006,The design is nice but this is not meant for tweens.,70006,4
70006,The item seems to be plastic and we could not bend it to make it fit better in the nose.,70006,4
70006,It kept falling out while she was trick-or-treating.,70006,4
70006,It is a good fake nose ring but it would have been great if we could have adjusted it slightly.,70006,4
70009,"As I'm aging, I'm trying to figure out what type of suit fits me and my body type.",70009,4
70009,I've always worn a 2 piece since I have a long torso.,70009,4
70009,I am 5'9 and weigh 160 lbs.,70009,4
70009,I have large hips and a small bust.,70009,4
70009,"I ordered the 4XL (12-14) and it is a little big but I wouldn't want to go down a size since I will more than likely not be swimming in it, just soaking up the sun.",70009,4
70009,I am very pleased with my purchase.,70009,4
70010,The coverage is decent even without the pads.,70010,4
70010,"I can't give them 5 stars because the straps fall down no matter how tight I adjust them, which is annoying.",70010,4
70011,"Very pretty set, very happy with purchase.",70011,4
70012,Grandson loves Batman but fits a bit large.,70012,4
70012,Nice heavy material and logo is quality.,70012,4
70012,Well he'll grow into it;),70012,4
70013,The feel and drape of the fabric is just fine.,70013,4
70013,And the jacket fits well enough with some built-in flexibility.,70013,4
70013,I would recommend buying this suit.,70013,4
70014,"I wanted to give 5 stars, yet I deducted a star because sometimes the links can begin to ""lay"" the wrong way and mess up the beautiful rope pattern this chain can display.",70014,4
70014,"I feel the chain could have been made with more links or clamped down to prevent them from ""laying"" the wrong way, but you can sorta fix it by rolling the chain to get the links back into perfect alignment.",70014,4
70014,"But its not a big deal, I just reserve 5 stars for products that exceed expectation.",70014,4
70014,It was fun to wear.,70014,4
70015,Can't beat the price.,70015,4
70015,Why pay $200 for the same ring in the Jewelry Stores?,70015,4
70017,The first one was 4 sizes too small.,70017,4
70017,I am a size 6 but reordered a 10.,70017,4
70017,Good thing prize is not bad and shipping was free.,70017,4
70017,"Size 10 fits great though, so size 6 will be a gift to a friend.",70017,4
70017,Not a total loss but hope others can learn from my review.,70017,4
70019,Super pretty and fun!,70019,4
70020,Looks great and well made,70020,4
70022,"Color is ve=y pretty and the dress is super comfortable, will b great for Fall.",70022,4
70023,I really enjoy this bathing suit.,70023,4
70023,I have a small bust and a big bottom and getting a medium fits me perfectly.,70023,4
70023,The material feels amazing.,70023,4
70023,It shipped in a timely manner which means a lot to me so I could use it this summer.,70023,4
70023,I'm 5'8 and about 145 and got a medium.,70023,4
70023,It fits perfectly on me.,70023,4
70024,Not sure if I can pull it off but super comfortable and fits as expected.,70024,4
70025,I liked the shorts but they fit like underwear without any give so I was able to wear them a short while before they ripped.,70025,4
70026,"These fit just fine, but I have to say.. we all deserve better.",70026,4
70026,"Years ago, I bought some Merona boxer-briefs from Target, and to this day, no underwear has ever been able to compare.",70026,4
70026,"Unfortunately, Merona doesn't make the same ones any longer.",70026,4
70026,The elastic edging on the legs is too tight - perhaps that's just me and my beefy thighs - but that shouldn't be an issue.,70026,4
70026,Regular boxers are just too long and get crumpled up inside my pants.,70026,4
70026,"I still prefer these over briefs or boxers, but that elastic needs to stretch with less resistance.",70026,4
70027,I wanted a ring that looks like my real engagement ring to travel with etc.,70027,4
70027,"The band is a little tdelicate - but the ring looks really great, especially for the price.",70027,4
70028,"Good basic hanky, no frills required, happy buyer.",70028,4
70029,It's exactly what you see.,70029,4
70029,Super soft and serves the purpose.,70029,4
70030,First order from Amazon.,70030,4
70030,I was pleased with my order,70030,4
70031,It was nice and as described but too hot for use at Coachella,70031,4
70032,Bought these as laces for my boots.,70032,4
70032,Cut them to size.,70032,4
70034,Good for touch extended hold time,70034,4
70035,I wish I had more pockets.,70035,4
70036,nice quality for 10$,70036,4
70037,The dress is bit different from the picture they used but it's still a very nice dress!,70037,4
70037,The dress fits great!,70037,4
70038,I am 5'1 and 135 pounds and ordered a medium of the grey.,70038,4
70038,Its not quit long enough to be a dress but goes perfect with some leggings.,70038,4
70038,Also pretty comfortable material.,70038,4
70040,Perfect size for my two year old granddaughter and still big enough to hold her stuff,70040,4
70043,they are soo pretty,70043,4
70045,"Stars and bars are only on one side, back is just red.",70045,4
70045,Larger than my other wallets but not too large to carry.,70045,4
70045,Seems to be ok,70045,4
70047,This thing is TINY.,70047,4
70047,1/4 of an inch wide.,70047,4
70047,But it seems well made and it's really cute.,70047,4
70047,I am about to gift it to someone!,70047,4
70048,Very long sleeves but adorable,70048,4
70049,"The fabrics held a lot of static and the lining didn't go down as far as the ""chiffon"".",70049,4
70049,"Other than that, the skirt was pretty and the fit was a okay (just a tad on the small side for me)",70049,4
70050,Cute as can be but very fragile !,70050,4
70051,"It's beautiful, I love the shape and I love the color, but I wish the leather were softer, I'm hoping it softens with use, and I wish there were more compartments, I'm having a problem finding a spot for my glasses and my phone.",70051,4
70051,I'd love a compartment on the outside of the bag so I could just reach and grab my glasses when I go into the store instead of digging around inside.,70051,4
70051,I actually bought two different styles of the same color because it's so beautiful and am having the same issue with that one too.,70051,4
70052,"Overall I was satisfied with the look and make of the costume, but it did seem to run
a little large.",70052,4
70052,Nothnig a safety pin couldn't fix.,70052,4
70053,Cute shirt but way too small compared to regular shirt sizes but the shirt is nice and thick quality.,70053,4
70054,When I opened the package I was really excited about this shirt!,70054,4
70054,It buttons around the neck which is really convenient so the neck line doesn't stretch.,70054,4
70054,It fits me the way I wanted it too.,70054,4
70054,I like more loose fitting clothes and this top is exactly what I was looking for.,70054,4
70054,"I'm 5""3 and it just about covers my belly button, this shirt goes great with high-waisted jeans or leggings.",70054,4
70054,The only thing I don't love about this is that I was very see through along the top.,70054,4
70054,"I went out and bought a white bra hoping it would blend in more, but sadly the outline of my bra is still very visible.",70054,4
70054,Maybe a nude bra would work a lot better to wear with this top.,70054,4
70054,"Besides the fact that it's see through, I still wear it and it's a very cute shirt to wear out clubbing, or to wear everyday.",70054,4
70055,Great quality bag that is super cute!,70055,4
70055,"BUT... if you're wanting a true ""beach bag,"" where you can fit beach towels and other usual stuff, this isn't the right bag.",70055,4
70055,Look at the measurements before ordering if you're wanting a big beach bag.,70055,4
70055,"I would definitely order again because I can use a smaller bag and it is really cute, but will need to order a different one for our needs of a true beach bag.",70055,4
70056,"Your standard burp rag...  nothing fancy, but it gets the job done!",70056,4
70057,Covers most of my overweight hips!,70057,4
70058,Such a cute bag!,70058,4
70058,I live everything about it.,70058,4
70058,My only con was that it was a lot smaller than I thought it would be.,70058,4
70058,"They do give measurements but, I must not have paid enough attention to them.",70058,4
70058,"So, it really is my bad.",70058,4
70058,"Honestly if you want a super cute leather sling bag, get this one.",70058,4
70059,Alittle wrinkleie out of the dryer,70059,4
70060,"This dress is very cute, great quality, but small in the chest area.",70060,4
70060,I ordered up a size and its still too small to wear with the front closed.,70060,4
70060,I will still wear the dress but with an under shirt.,70060,4
70060,This is a common issue for me even in US sizes  since my chest is a 36D so I don't blame the manufacturer at all.,70060,4
70060,I'm normally a women's medium so I ordered a large but I probably should have gone Xl.,70060,4
70060,Think of the chest sizing as juniors for this garment.,70060,4
70060,Other than that shipping was fast and this is a very well made dress.,70060,4
70061,"The ratcheting strap seems fragile, but for how much I paid for the shoes, I can't complain.",70061,4
70062,I love the color and the versatility of this top.,70062,4
70062,I can wear it over a black top in cold weather and a white t-shirt in warmer weather.,70062,4
70062,I'd like to see more crocheted tops from this company.,70062,4
70063,It fit me perfectly.,70063,4
70063,My boyfriend loves it!,70063,4
70063,I took the other reviewers advice when it came to sizing.,70063,4
70063,"I am 5'8"" and 185 lb.",70063,4
70063,I love that it is so flattering.,70063,4
70063,"My boobs are on the smaller size and I've got a little pick belly, but it transforms all of that.",70063,4
70063,A lovely shade of red.,70063,4
70063,It's really great for the price.,70063,4
70064,A bit tight in the shoulders but other than that it's great,70064,4
70065,I love it I wish I had order a lg.,70065,4
70065,but great fabric and style,70065,4
70066,"very nice, but you cant really have a bust with this.",70066,4
70067,"I'm 5""3' and around 130 and they fit great.",70067,4
70067,"They go a bit high, but that's because I'm pretty short, if I don't pull them up so much they look good.",70067,4
70067,"Super comfortable fabric, pretty stretchy, great purchase!",70067,4
70068,Bought this as a gift.,70068,4
70068,Came in a cute bag and seems to be exactly what I was looking for!,70068,4
70068,Hoping the person I purchased it for puts it to good use!,70068,4
70069,I love the design and fit.,70069,4
70069,"My only concern is that when it shipped it was already ticking, and I am worried about the battery life.",70069,4
70070,It came a week faster than expected so I was happy.,70070,4
70070,It is a burnt orange color but I wanted the color anyways from the other reviews.,70070,4
70070,Since it is one size it fit like a baby tee on me but it still looks cute!,70070,4
70071,I normally wear a small in american clothing but ordered an extra large just to be safe.,70071,4
70071,"even this i can barely wear, it almost tapers at the waist so that the shoulders fit fine but the bottom is tight, lands just below my belly button, not my widest point.",70071,4
70071,the material is Great.,70071,4
70071,"not the usual thin, see through material you usually get from these imported items.",70071,4
70072,Bought it as a gift.,70072,4
70074,"Like it but needs to offer a smaller size, plus use a darker pink for the writing",70074,4
70075,It's a pretty pendant.,70075,4
70075,There was a little glue around the edges when I received it that I had to chip off.,70075,4
70076,Extremely difficult to screw in the stone though.,70076,4
70076,My dear husband was able to attach the screw-in stone for me on two of these horseshoes.,70076,4
70076,"It took him many tries, but got it done.",70076,4
70078,THIS DRESS RUNS VERY SMALL.,70078,4
70078,I cannot stress that enough.,70078,4
70078,"I am a 12/14, 38DD and ordered a 3XL.",70078,4
70078,"Other than that, I really like the dress.",70078,4
70078,I purchased the green one and it's almost identical to the picture.,70078,4
70078,The only real complaint I have it the drawstring: it's like a sweatshirt drawstring.,70078,4
70078,Wish it was little more dainty but I guess the sturdiness will make it last longer.,70078,4
70078,All in all Inwoukd recommend,70078,4
70079,Nice big bold face.,70079,4
70079,You can easily glance at the watch to see the time.,70079,4
70079,The band fits perfectly - not too loose & not too tight.,70079,4
70079,The rose gold color is a nice change from just gold color everything.,70079,4
70079,Packaged well when shipped.,70079,4
70079,"Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because at the beginning, it lost time one time only.",70079,4
70079,Seems to be doing great for the three days we have owned it.,70079,4
70079,"For the price, you will be pleasantly surprised at just how nice this watch is.",70079,4
70079,Go ahead and buy it!,70079,4
70080,"it fits real well, i like it, but would love it if was a bit longer, i been the whole day pulling it down, even worse with wind,",70080,4
70081,I wasn't expecting them to be so small.,70081,4
70081,But I do like how they look on me.,70081,4
70081,My package was delivered a lot faster than I was expecting and came in a nice felt pouch.,70081,4
70082,"Great, exactly as expected.",70082,4
70082,Want to buy more for sure!,70082,4
70083,I have wide feet and Belleville is one of the few boot companies that I can rely on to make true-to-size length sizes in a wide boot.,70083,4
70083,These are a great boot.,70083,4
70083,"They're a touch on the heavy side and have stiff vibram soles, which are a bit hard, but I've remedied that with gel inserts.",70083,4
70084,Bought this in an XL as I'm big busted and wanted it looser to wear with leggings.,70084,4
70084,The fabric is pre-shrunk which made this shirt a bit larger than expected.,70084,4
70084,And even after washing in hot water won't shrink.,70084,4
70084,But it's super cute and am excited to wear on my trip to Vegas to get married in a couple weeks!,70084,4
70084,Took off 1 star for sizing and it's slightly see through.,70084,4
70085,I would by another.,70085,4
70086,Excellent for plantar problems.,70086,4
70086,I've used these for many years and they are comfortable wearing all day.,70086,4
70087,Purchased this for my significant other because he's been wanting an all black pair of Vans.,70087,4
70087,So I bought this to add to his collection.,70087,4
70087,He likes the fit and can wear them all day with just about any outfit.,70087,4
70089,Definitely size up 1-2 sizes!,70089,4
70089,"You get what you pay for, so don't expect quality boning.",70089,4
70090,Just a little stiffer than I expected.,70090,4
70091,It took forever to get here.,70091,4
70091,"It fits like a glove though, I ordered 2xl and I wear a medium.",70091,4
70091,It's very light weight and I would consider ordering more.,70091,4
70093,My toddler is comfy in there and they keep his feet warm & dry!,70093,4
70095,this hat even fits the mommy;) keeps the ears warm as normal bean,70095,4
70096,A little tight but not loose.,70096,4
70096,Have good air flow ( not much sweat ).,70096,4
70096,Ordered a few more...))),70096,4
70097,Good value for the price.,70097,4

70097,Wish it came in more colors and I would get them all.,70097,4
70098,It is a nice sweater to have in my wardrobe.,70098,4
70098,It is a nice shade of red.,70098,4
70099,Lovely just to small,70099,4
70100,"She is a small person so she wears another shirt under it, but she does love them.",70100,4
70102,I like the material and quality...,70102,4
70103,"It was cute, but it broke and fell off sometime during the second week i had it.",70103,4
70103,But i was sent another one so that was good.,70103,4
70104,"Came quickly, but was smaller than I expected for my son.",70104,4
70104,"It does still fit, but it's not going to last as long as I was hoping for him.",70104,4
70104,"Oh well, his sister will likely wear it too.",70104,4
70105,it is very pretty and the large stone sparkles so nice but you can't hardly see the tiny stone sparkle and I wish they sold them in half sizes so that is why I gave it 4 stars,70105,4
70106,Wore a bunch of sweaters under and stretched out a bit.,70106,4
70107,Not as much compression as I would have thought and the neck is doesn't fit snug.,70107,4
70107,I will wear it but not sure how long it will last.,70107,4
70108,"The service was fast, the only problem is the ball area is a little small, and my girl friend loves them on me!",70108,4
70109,Good  for  winter  days ..!!!!!!!!!,70109,4
70110,These sunglasses were a Christmas present for my daughter.,70110,4
70110,"She wants the brand name, designer sunglasses but she losses them so much I refuse to spend the money anymore.",70110,4
70110,These glasses are the style my daughter likes and she is wearing them.,70110,4
70110,"If she losses this pair, they can be replaced for a good price so I am calling them good.",70110,4
70110,"Should the glasses themselves actually last long enough to get a review on durability, I'll update this and let you know.",70110,4
70111,"Fits good toes go numb after 27 miles but not bad enough to discourage riding, shoes and clip pedals decreases fatigue during pedaling.",70111,4
70112,Fits too loose for what I like.,70112,4
70112,My American Large/xxxl Asian and my partners American Medium/xxl Asian are loose.,70112,4
70112,I tried on his size and they fit tight as I like.,70112,4
70112,In the correct size the pouch fits very good and supports my package.,70112,4
70112,Not for deep winter wear because they are thin.,70112,4
70112,Thicker and proper sizing chart would have received 5 stars.,70112,4
70112,I will reorder more in the correct size and they will help under my leather pants for extra warmth.,70112,4
70113,The ears are a little odd and the hoodie is a little big but other than that I love this thing so comfy great fit!,70113,4
70114,The size is perfect for everyday and I love the color especially for the holidays.,70114,4
70115,"Nice material, looks really cute on.",70115,4
70115,"Only problem is, it was too short in the arms and a little tight on the shoulder (im 5'7 and 133lb), but besides that it's definitely wearable and cute.",70115,4
70116,"Nice construction, fit is good",70116,4
70117,Just delivered....very prompt service.,70117,4
70117,Good quality and a nice fit.,70117,4
70117,I thought it was blue as pictured but I received a green one.,70117,4
70118,I had to order another one so most of my friends would know what KOLOA is all about surfs up.,70118,4
70119,I have pretty medium size thighs and the tops roll down/won't stay up and cut into my leg once the fall down.,70119,4
70120,"love it, covers all the are I want covered.",70120,4
70120,Bought it too small but I got time to drop a size before my up coming cruise,70120,4
70121,A little bulkier than I would have liked.,70121,4
70123,I love the look...and the price!!,70123,4
70128,"I am returning my suit for an exchange - I absolutely love the bathing suit, although because of my shape, it is too large in the buttocks area and too small for my size chest.",70128,4
70129,Very Nice suit- love the bottoms!,70129,4
70130,Slightly short and the buttons don't stay buttoned when he sits down.,70130,4
70130,Other than that very cute and seems like quality material!,70130,4
70131,Absolutely love the vibrant colors.,70131,4
70131,"Ordered medium, but this is closer to a men's small, than a men's medium.",70131,4
70132,The fabric was a little more clingy than I had expected.,70132,4
70132,Still a cute dress.,70132,4
70132,I wear a size juniors 11 and the medium fits just right.,70132,4
70133,"I bought this for my twin boys when they were 12 months, about 20 lbs and 29"" tall.",70133,4
70133,It is super soft and just a little loose which is great.,70133,4
70133,"It is not ""snug fitting"" which is what I wanted.",70133,4
70133,"It is a thinner fleece material, but still very warm.",70133,4
70133,This fit great for a few months.,70133,4
70133,"Now my guys are 16 months (25 lbs and 32"" tall) and this still fits everywhere pretty well except the feet.",70133,4
70133,The feet are now way too small.,70133,4
70133,I ended up just cutting the feet off and using socks to finish out the winter.,70133,4
70133,"I wish I would have bough them sooner, for the price, I would have liked to have gotten a little more wear out of them.",70133,4
70133,Overall a very good buy.,70133,4
70133,This was washed about 3-5 times a week for the past 4 months and still looks virtually brand new.,70133,4
70135,Came quickly and was of good quality.,70135,4
70136,I bought this to wear under a regular tshirt & its perfect.,70136,4
70136,"Wel made, somewhat spandex-y & not too think or thin.",70136,4
70136,I bought both orange& white & they fit perfectly under my other tshirt without rolling up.,70136,4
70136,I bought the Small & its perfect since I wanted it tight & under my tshirt,70136,4
70137,"This gun will fit in your hand, probably.",70137,4
70139,"My husband ordered an extra large and it fits fine, but he has lost 30 lbs.",70139,4
70139,if he had not lost the weight it would not have fit.,70139,4
70140,"Was exactly what I expected, very happy with it",70140,4
70141,It came with some scratches but otherwise it's really good.,70141,4
70141,"I expected it to be a slightly heavy necklace, but it's really light.",70141,4
70141,"A dirty trick was played though, in the package my EXO wallet came in (they were ordered together) it said the necklace and wallet were both in there, but I couldn't find the necklace so I looked inside the wallet.",70141,4
70141,The necklace was placed in the wallet.,70141,4
70141,That momentary freak out about not having my necklace scared me.,70141,4
70141,Either way I got it and i'm very pleased with what I got.,70141,4
70143,Just a tab bit small but will work.,70143,4
70143,"Well made, material feels nice.",70143,4
70144,"Pretty comfortable, but if you live in a snowy or icy climate, you need treads on the bottom, or forget about wearing them.",70144,4
70144,SUPER slippery on snow or ice...even just a fine dusting of snow and you'll be on your ass if you're not careful.,70144,4
70145,Love Game of Thrones.,70145,4
70145,This is a very comfortable costume.,70145,4
70145,I read other reviews that mentioned the slits on the sides and I have to agree they are HIGH....I actually quickly sewed them  a bit before wearing so I felt less exposed.,70145,4
70145,I had also been nervous  about the cut out above the chest area...it was not as big as I expected which was a relief.,70145,4
70145,"You definitely will need to wear something under the skirt, unless you want a sheer look (no judgement here!).",70145,4
70145,It arrived quickly and packaged nicely.,70145,4
70147,My wife loves this!,70147,4
70147,So warm and soft.,70147,4
70147,Perfect for Colorado's worst winter weather.,70147,4
70147,"I have a similar model, and it is so awesome that I just had to buy this for my wife.",70147,4
70147,"The buckle could be a bit larger for ease of manipulation, but that may be a personal preference.",70147,4
70148,"Just wanted to say, this dress is really Amazing.",70148,4
70148,Keep providing great products.,70148,4
70149,The color was accurate to the picture and the lace is very pretty.,70149,4
70149,I sized up and it fit nicely.,70149,4
70149,The sleeves as quite long so I'm likely going to hem them but as a shorter person that isn't too surprising.,70149,4
70151,"I really liked the way the dress looked and the material, particularly considering the low cost of the item.",70151,4
70151,"Unfortunately for me, it is not for girls with breasts.",70151,4
70151,It fit my sister just fine (we are the same size except she is smaller up top).,70151,4
70151,"If you are a pear shape or thin, then this should look great on you.",70151,4
70152,Got compliments on it first time I wore it,70152,4
70154,After years of wearing Champion these were not  a great subsitute.,70154,4
70156,"Very attractive, nice watch, love it.",70156,4
70157,"love some of the designs, could have done without a couple.",70157,4
70158,Lovely compact unit with enough space for cards and cash and makes sure that you don't collect unnecessary rubbish in your wallet.,70158,4
70158,Need to make sure that you don't keep the wallet in the same pocket as coins as coins will scratch the lovely finish,70158,4
70159,Maybe a bit too small for my wrist even with elastic.,70159,4
70159,I have others that are not this way and wrap easily without gaps in beads.,70159,4
70160,I really like this swimsuit for its retro vibe.,70160,4
70160,The bottoms are high waisted for stomach coverage and the top does a nice job of covering too.,70160,4
70160,"Iam 5'2"" and 185lbs; I usually wear a size 12-14 and have a chest size of 38G.",70160,4
70160,"For this suit, I bought a 3XL.",70160,4
70160,From other reviews I knew to buy much larger than usual.,70160,4
70160,The top fits snugly.,70160,4
70160,The cups make me muffin top slightly and the bottoms are quite large.,70160,4
70160,The backside isn't nearly as flattering as the front but overall the suit is nice for someone that is looking for a two piece while also wanting a little more all over coverage.,70160,4
70161,"We love these little shoes, and they matched our daughter's outfit for family pictures perfectly, HOWEVER they run very thin.",70161,4
70161,"Length-wise, they fit great, but they are a little narrow.",70161,4
70161,"If your child has a thick or wide foot, they might not be a great choice.",70161,4
70161,"One thing that made them the choice for us, though, was the strap that kept them on our toddler's foot.",70161,4
70162,This swimsuit is very cute and very flattering.,70162,4
70162,My only complaint is that it doesn't have a lot of support in the breast area.,70162,4
70162,"The back is really cute, as it is crisscrossed.",70162,4
70162,The length is just enough to feel modest.,70162,4
70162,"The pattern is super cute, and looks exactly the same as the picture.",70162,4
70163,Fits small but a very nice fabric.,70163,4
70165,"If you're looking for a bright, tropical shirt to wear to a theme party or something, this is it.",70165,4
70165,"But if you're looking for a festive, topical shirt to add to your normal wardrobe & wear plus wash with the expectation that it'll hold-up
for at least a couple years like a normal shirt, this is NOT it.",70165,4
70165,"I have some 'real' Hawaiian/tropical shirts bought years ago, & they're much higher quality than this, but this shirt was a quick & easy, relatively inexpensive shirt that I really just had a one-time need for.",70165,4
70165,"I haven't tried washing it yet, but I don't expect it to hold up well...",70165,4
70166,"Quality is alright, service not helpful to change size",70166,4
70167,I knew they ran small according to other reviews so I ordered the XL.,70167,4
70167,I'm normally a size 8.,70167,4
70168,My son wore the black pair to his uncle's wedding.,70168,4
70168,They fit very well and coordinated with his tux.,70168,4
70169,This little purse is cute and little nitty bout as long as a women's hand.,70169,4
70169,But it will serve the purpose.,70169,4
70170,Louv it am very happy,70170,4
70171,The fit and style are exactly as shown.,70171,4
70171,"Good product, would buy again.",70171,4
70173,"This is a nice, heavy flannel.",70173,4
70173,Can't wait for the weather to turn.,70173,4
70173,"Very comfy shirt, comfy fit.",70173,4
70174,My little guy is 7 mos and 22lbs.,70174,4
70174,I read a review from someone else who said the 9-12 month fit theirs at the same age and weight but ours was a bit tight around the legs.,70174,4
70174,:) We got through the ceremony fine but would have ordered the next size up.,70174,4
70175,very easy to carry in pocket,70175,4
70176,I have wide feet so I purchased this basic sandal for that reason.,70176,4
70176,"The width is pretty good, maybe even a bit wider than expected.",70176,4
70176,"The straps are a little wonky, not real happy with that.",70176,4
70176,Next time I will purchase the slim ones.,70176,4
70177,Make sure to check the sizing.,70177,4
70177,"If you follow the chart, no problem",70177,4
70179,"I've recently tried several brands of more expensive undewear (than hanes), looking for something really comfortable (Lacoste, Jack Wills, RLTD, Saxx, etc).",70179,4
70179,"These are nice underwear for lounging, but I noticed them riding up while I was on the move (running/jogging).",70179,4
70179,"Lacoste is about the same price but did not have this problem, so I'd recommend you to look there if that is a concern for you.",70179,4
70179,"If you have the money, Saxx was far superior (their pouch cradles the junk much better and makes it look more aesthetic) - but don't waste your time on Jack Wills or RLTD as both of them were uncomfortable (especially RLTD - which had abrasive seams).",70179,4
70180,"For my daughter, I think she will like it.",70180,4
70181,Cute glasses but did not like the slight tint on the glass.,70181,4
70181,Was expecting them to be clear.,70181,4
70182,The socks look great.,70182,4
70182,These aren't high-quality socks.,70182,4
70182,They're thin and will likely get holes in the near future.,70182,4
70182,"However, they're inexpensive as all hell and you get eight of them.",70182,4
70182,So though these aren't incredible socks they are fantastic for this price point.,70182,4
70182,I'd definitely recommend buying these.,70182,4
70182,Just likely expect to replace them within the year.,70182,4
70182,"Note: I haven't even washed mine yet, so I can't speak to how well they look after that.",70182,4
70182,I'm just giving my impression from initially opening the pack and wearing a couple of them.,70182,4
70182,TL;DR: Thin and not the best quality but a fantastic value given the price.,70182,4
70183,Like the boot trees.,70183,4
70183,Amazon apparently thinks you wear the shoe trees based on the questions they ask about fit and comfort.,70183,4
70183,The cedar trees are shaped to fit western boots.,70183,4
70183,I use them on Lucchese kangaroo hide boots.,70183,4
70183,Slides in and out easily.,70183,4
70183,Holds the foot shape so the boots appearance remains sharp.,70183,4
70183,These trees only shapes the boot foot so you won't maintain the shaft's appearance with them.,70183,4
70183,Cedar wood leaves the boots smelling fresh between wear and absorbs moisture to protect the leather.,70183,4
70183,Worth the investment for expensive boots.,70183,4
70184,"Lovely, true fit, very warm and super comfy bras for all day/all night but the unnecessary 'pads' that come with these look lumpy and just plain strange.",70184,4
70184,"These bras definitely look fine without the goofy, clunky pad-inserts.",70184,4
70185,I love this bag!,70185,4
70185,It's huge and sturdy and has plenty of room for everything I carry day to day.,70185,4
70185,"It looks exactly as it does in the picture, too.",70185,4
70185,My only issues are the floating zipper and the cross-body strap.,70185,4
70185,"The zipper does not cover the whole mouth of the bag: instead, it looks as if its not meant to keep the bag closed so much as to keep the bag from gaping wide open when being carried/set down (the shape of the bag makes it 'spread', especially when it's full).",70185,4
70185,This does not bother me (I have plenty of open-topped bags) but what does is the zipper's inability to stay closed.,70185,4
70185,"Every time I zip it up, it unzips itself pretty quickly afterwards!",70185,4
70185,"As for the bag strap, like many other reviewers to my disappointment I found the clasps to be very weak.",70185,4
70185,"My second day out with the bag, I was walking down the street and the bag dropped to the ground, since the metal lobster clasp had snapped.",70185,4
70185,I might have taken a star for that if bundle monster had not been incredibly helpful in sending me a brand new strap.,70185,4
70185,"I still bought another just in case this one breaks, too: for anyone interested in a sturdier, slightly more stylish strap that matches this bag perfectly, I suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adjustable-Genuine-Slick-Brown-Leather-Shoulder-Strap-for-Any-Bag-Silver/dp/B012UWKMQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adjustable Genuine Slick Brown Leather Shoulder Strap for Any Bag (Silver)</a>.",70185,4
70185,"It's also great if you, like me, love this bag enough that you'd rather pay for a better strap than return the bag :)",70185,4
70186,Purchased this for my very petite Aunt and it fit perfectly!,70186,4
70189,Nice bag i really liked it my daughter uses it,70189,4
70190,Just received this top today and had to immediately try it on.,70190,4
70190,Very comfy and looks just like the picture.,70190,4
70190,I don't agree that it looks cheap or cheaply made.,70190,4
70190,"I'm 5'6"" and currently 137 lbs and I ordered a dark blue size 10.",70190,4
70190,It fit just right without being tight anywhere.,70190,4
70191,I get lots of complements on this necklace.,70191,4
70191,Little do they know how much it cost.,70191,4
70191,"My only con is that sometimes it is hard to get it to sit flat like the picture because the base underneath the crystals is actually quite round/oddly shaped, which causes the necklace to tilt one way or another.",70191,4
70192,Bought this as a present.,70192,4
70192,Seemed to be good quality.,70192,4
70192,It is a thick wallet for someone who tends to keep a lot of stuff in their wallet,70192,4
70193,My girlfriend loved it.,70193,4
70193,Is great that it was in the small size.,70193,4
70193,She has very small wrist.,70193,4
70194,The hat is a great fit and quality materials,70194,4
70197,I'm a big girl with a belly.,70197,4
70197,"This dress fits me very well, but hugs me around the belly, which I didn't want.",70197,4
70197,"However, this can be ""camouflaged"" with a nice light sweater or cover-up.",70197,4
70197,"Otherwise, I love the color, it stretches well across my big ta-tas and gives you a nice shape.",70197,4
70199,This is the second Peg Perego car seat that I bought I got one at my country and decided to buy the same one when we moved here.,70199,4
70199,I simply love Peg Perego.,70199,4
70199,Though it might be more expensive than other car seats the design worth it.,70199,4
70199,The baby goes secure.,70199,4
70199,It's easy to clean.,70199,4
70199,One con is that it won't come with a cup holder.,70199,4
70199,If you want one you should buy it separately when most of the car seats include one.,70199,4
70200,Easy way to become a butterfly.,70200,4
70200,My only complaint is that the finger loops at the tips of the wings are so small they cut off circulation in even a pinky.,70200,4
70200,Another quarter inch would make all the difference.,70200,4
70201,..a little thin and back is not matched in print but still a keeper for 5 dollars,70201,4
70202,Fits well and quite comfortable.,70202,4
70202,Ordered one size up as advised.,70202,4
70203,Fit is exactly as expected.,70203,4
70203,"Loose as shown in photo, but cut in a way so that it still shows you have a waist.",70203,4
70203,It is very comfortable and soft.,70203,4
70203,"I will order more, but in a size smaller for a more fitted looked.",70203,4
70203,I gave 4 stars because the sleeve pattern in the fuchsia/ivory shirt had more of a teal leaf pattern mixed in with the floral.,70203,4
70203,"It's still pretty, but not quite what I was expecting.",70203,4
70204,"For a one size fits all, it is kind of small.",70204,4
70204,i'm 5'4 at 130 lbs and it was slightly tight and fit awkward in the front.,70204,4
70204,I still kept it and figured i'd make it work.,70204,4
70204,I love the colors and design; it looks like the picture.,70204,4
70205,"Runs a slight bit too small, but arrived timely and looks great",70205,4
70206,nice and fit well,70206,4
70207,Totally met my expectation!,70207,4
70207,THe only bummer is that it's super wrinkly!,70207,4
70207,But the cleaners will fix that!,70207,4
70208,I'm not sure how well it works because it wasn't comfortable enough or discreet enough to wear outside the house.,70208,4
70209,Great dress but if your bust size is larger than a B or C cup this may not be the best fitting dress for you!,70209,4
70210,Color is beautiful runs a little big,70210,4
70211,Pretty but looks cheap.,70211,4
70211,What do you expect though for the price.,70211,4
70212,I bought this product because my brand new suitcase popped open the last time I traveled (I'm pretty sure TSA didn't secure the bag after an inspection).,70212,4
70212,I don't care so much about keeping people out as just ensuring my stuff stays inside.,70212,4
70212,"Plus, it's an easy way to distinguish a pretty generic bag.",70212,4
70212,I just placed the strap on my suitcase and it looks like it will work.,70212,4
70212,The initial placement was a bit of a struggle but it wasn't too difficult.,70212,4
70212,The product doesn't come with any directions.,70212,4
70212,I did have to come back to the product page a few times to help me figure out how it works.,70212,4
70212,"I also want to note that my adjuster faces outward, unlike several other reviewers.",70212,4
70212,I think this is because I have a larger suitcase and the adjuster faces different directions based on whether the strap is expanded or not.,70212,4
70212,Once the adjuster is expanded to go through the triangle it faces a different direction.,70212,4
70212,"Overall, I like it.",70212,4
70212,"However, the real challenge will be the long day of travel I have ahead of me tomorrow.",70212,4
70213,A bit cheap looking but generally okay.,70213,4
70214,"I didn't think I would use this product, but honestly, it was a must-have for my wedding.",70214,4
70215,"came just on time as said, it's beautiful in person just like the picture!",70215,4
70215,only complaint I can give it is a few of the jewels fell off when trying on..  other then that the dress is amazing!,70215,4
70215,:) definitely worth the buy.,70215,4
70216,"i like it, it hugs my shape but not too tight.",70216,4
70216,I sized up like recommended,70216,4
70217,I have purchased several straps from Clockwork and for the most part it is of decent quality.,70217,4
70217,Also great customer follow up.,70217,4
70217,Keep up the good work.,70217,4
70218,Great cut and not too fancy material,70218,4
70219,"The material holds lint very well but other than that, they are so comfortable.",70219,4
70219,I would buy this product again.,70219,4
70219,I love the style and the comfortability they provide.,70219,4
70219,The only downfall is that they trap so much lint and there is nothing you can do to save them once the lint is there.,70219,4
70220,I think this runs small.,70220,4
70221,I wear it frequently on cooler days under other blouses.,70221,4
70221,It is comfy and washes up well.,70221,4
70222,great design for outdoor,70222,4
70223,Just slightly snug in the shoulders.,70223,4
70223,But the draw string and off the shoulder option take care of that.,70223,4
70224,Perfect to dress up leggings with heels or boots.,70224,4
70224,Also with a short tight skirt,70224,4
70225,Nice mom's love it,70225,4
70226,Love it right length nice fsbric,70226,4
70227,"I'm surprised this is considered a L. I ordered up to be safe like I always am with sizes from Amazon, could have gone with a M but the bow helps sinch the extra material!",70227,4
70227,"I'm 5""2' and 131 lbs with a 32/34D cup.",70227,4
70228,These work great for a Harry Potter costume.,70228,4
70228,The glasses did sit a little bit wide on our 3 year old.,70228,4
70229,Love the look and feel of this hat.,70229,4
70229,"Very lightweight, perfect for a summer wedding.",70229,4
70229,"The price is right, also.",70229,4
70229,"However, I have a smallish head so it is a big too large.",70229,4
70229,"I am going to surprise my (thick headed lol) sister with it, as I sadly had to purchase a different cloche hat (at an antique mall).",70229,4
70229,I recommend if you have a normal- sized head!,70229,4
70231,I like the pattern and fabric...very light and cool without being too revealing.,70231,4
70231,"I am a 5'10 women, size 12 and the garment is somewhat roomy about the waist and tummy.",70231,4
70232,3 shirts under 20 buck how could u got wring.,70232,4
70232,Great for travel in warm weather regions.,70232,4
70232,I thought the bottom would be rusched  but it's not.,70232,4
70232,It's just straight cut.,70232,4
70232,It's also about a fewInches shorter than  how it looks in the photo.,70232,4
70232,I'm 5'6 and it doesn't come past my butt or hit my low hip.,70232,4
70232,It hits about 2 inches below my belly button.,70232,4
70232,"But for a knocked around effortless shirt  for thd house  or even a cover up at beach , it's honestly  perfect.",70232,4
70233,I wish I could rate higher but there are a couple small issues with the dress that are preventing me from doing so.,70233,4
70233,For the price this dress is gorgeous.,70233,4
70233,It arrived quickly and the beading and look of the dress is very pretty.,70233,4
70233,It came with some poofy tulle crinoline under it that I cut out as I want the dress to hang more naturally.,70233,4
70233,I sent my custom measurements  and the fit is pretty good .. slightly long.,70233,4
70233,It is missing the appliques in the back below the zipper as shown in the picture which has created a bit of a gap in my opinion but still good.,70233,4
70233,For this price it's a beautiful dress.,70233,4
70233,I just need to get it hemmed in the front .. going to leave it a little longer in the back as it doesn't have a train.,70233,4
70233,The material and appliques are very good quality.,70233,4
70233,I can't wait to wear it !,70233,4
70234,Wish it was just a little longer.,70234,4
70234,Hits just above the ankle but very comfortable and love the pockets and the back!,70234,4
70235,the material stretches but it feels great and comfortable.,70235,4
70235,"i definitely recommend this dress, its simple and cute.",70235,4
70235,"perfect for any occasion, you can dress it up for more formal occasions or keep it as is which is casual.",70235,4
70235,the only thing is the belt that comes with it tends to be large even when i wrap it around the hip area.,70235,4
70235,the loose areas are around the armpit area but i think its better so the arm has more space to move around.,70235,4
70235,if its too tight it would feel like the arm cant move up or down.,70235,4
70235,this is dress is just perfect.,70235,4
70236,I've been searching for a sleek wallet that will hold my numerous credit/debit cards and yet keep its sleek and slim look and not appear overloaded.,70236,4
70236,My next decision was color....pink!,70236,4
70236,This slim wallet is the perfect size for me.,70236,4
70236,It holds all my cards and still looks sleek and slim.,70236,4
70236,"Even with every card in place, the wallet snaps shut easily and doesn't look overloaded.",70236,4
70236,"However, it's not pink as the picture described.",70236,4
70236,It's more of a Merlot.,70236,4
70237,Very happy with it.,70237,4
70237,"I am 5'5, athletic build, and D cup.",70237,4
70237,I ordered a medium and it fits great.,70237,4
70237,The only downside is that you can't move too much or the bow on the bra will get messed up.,70237,4
70237,So it's not a good one to plan a dance in.,70237,4
70237,Also it doesn't hide easily under clothes.,70237,4
70237,So it's best to plan out a surprise where you can be waiting for them or something.,70237,4
70237,He definitely liked it though and it will be used again!,70237,4
70239,super cute skirt very comfy goes with anything,70239,4
70242,"Love the dress, but had to have it altered.",70242,4
70242,Too big in the bust.,70242,4
70242,"I bought a size larger then I normally would, because their sizes run small.",70242,4
70244,Good shirt great guitar company,70244,4
70245,They are comfy and warm but they stretch out easily.,70245,4
70245,Goes back to normal after I wash them though which is good.,70245,4
70246,"Cute, warm and comfy",70246,4
70247,This is a pretty top but does run small and after I washed it the first time it shrunk quite a bit and now is so tight I don't really want to wear it (There's no tag inside with care instructions but I washed it in cold water on delicate cycle.).,70247,4
70247,I do love the pattern and the material is soft (it does wrinkle easily though) so I gave it 4 stars even though I can't really wear it any more.,70247,4
70247,I suggest ordering a larger size than you think you need (and possibly dry clean it?).,70247,4
70247,I bought this to wear as a shirt over leggings instead of as a dress.,70247,4
70247,"I'm 5'8"" with a long torso and it was a good length for that.",70247,4
70247,"After the shrinkage, there's no way I could have worn it as a dress.",70247,4
70247,It would be too short to cover my bum!,70247,4
70247,I paid full price for this item and do not have a relationship with the seller.,70247,4
70247,I bought this item solely for my personal use.,70247,4
70248,Getting it set accurately was not as easy as it should've been.,70248,4
70248,Now that it is however runs fine no problems.,70248,4
70250,These are fun socks...surprisingly well made.,70250,4
70250,Great gift for an artist.,70250,4
70252,"They run very large , went down two sizes!",70252,4
70253,"other than it being too big, I like it.",70253,4
70254,"Nicely crafted of real, durable leather.",70254,4
70254,The design is beautiful!!,70254,4
70254,"Either my husband or
I can take this checkbook cover when shopping.",70254,4
70254,"Some covers I considered were too
feminine-looking.",70254,4
70255,a little larger than expected but love the material & it is just to sleep in so no big deal,70255,4
70256,I bought it for a gift.,70256,4
70257,Quality is nothing special.,70257,4
70257,"Don't be afraid to go a size up, because it does shrink a little.",70257,4
70257,"Other than that, the product is exactly as described!",70257,4
70258,The best pair of saddle shoes for the money on the market.,70258,4
70259,"This waste trimmer/corset is awesome, the boning keeps its shape and is not uncomfortable at all!",70259,4
70259,"Sizing is way off though for larger gals, I wear an XL/12 and had to buy a 3X to fit me, see attached photos, on a side note I got a medium for someone and it fit as expected correct sizing for her.",70259,4
70259,Yes this is meant to be tight but as you can see in the photos the laces were still very far apart.,70259,4
70259,"All in all great corset, great price, very happy with my purchase, just check the sizing before purchasing so you do not need to exchange it :)",70259,4
70260,This is a nice set.,70260,4
70260,However like others said it does run big.,70260,4
70260,I wear size XL or 16.,70260,4
70260,This plus size run so big that the top are too big for me.,70260,4
70260,I have to return it for the size issue.,70260,4
70260,"Otherwise, it is pretty good set, the dress is longer than it should be but not everyone is model figure to wear mini skirt.",70260,4
70261,"Hat is really nice, the only problem with it would be the stitching.",70261,4
70261,"It was done very sloppy, but from afar you can't really tell.",70261,4
70262,"Like this bracelet, even though it is cheap looking.",70262,4
70262,Matches a more expensive ring that I have.,70262,4
70263,"thought it would be more flowy, i had a L and its snug!",70263,4
70264,I bought for my daughter.,70264,4
70264,I did not expect the strings.,70264,4
70264,It's a detractor for me due to fact my daughter is lazy with tying bows.,70264,4
70265,"I wish the edges were a little more fringy or lacy, but I like it",70265,4
70266,Very cute dress for the price.,70266,4
70266,Had to sew a few seams but overall liked the fit,70266,4
70267,This snap on stuff is new to me and I really like the ability to change it up.,70267,4
70267,The bracelet itself is comfy so I will be wearing oftenl,70267,4
70269,My daughter likes these shoes a lot.,70269,4
70269,She hasn't worn them much as they would be too distracting at school with the lights on and she's afraid the lights may come on.,70269,4
70270,This dress is absolutely cute!!,70270,4
70270,The picture is not deceiving at all.,70270,4
70270,I am currently in the middle of a weight loss journey.,70270,4
70270,"When you've lost 75 pounds and have 45 more to go, you need to find clothes that fit.",70270,4
70270,However you can't afford a new wardrobe now and again in 45 pounds.,70270,4
70270,This dress was a perfect addition.,70270,4
70270,The fit of the dress was what I expected.,70270,4
70270,"Chinese manufactured items like this tend to run small, so I always order a size up.",70270,4
70270,"I'm currently wearing an xl in most clothes, so I got a 2xl in this.",70270,4
70270,The material reminds me of a dry fit spandex type feel.,70270,4
70270,"It is very stretchable, but extra lightweight.",70270,4
70270,I love that it is quarter sleeve as well.,70270,4
70270,"I like to hide my bat wings, and this dress does that nicely.",70270,4
70270,The length of the dress is also perfect.,70270,4
70270,I'm 5'7 and it falls right at my ankle.,70270,4
70270,I wouldn't want it any shorter or longer.,70270,4
70270,My one complaint about this dress is that the material does not hide any imperfections.,70270,4
70270,"As you can see in the photo, it definitely shows the bra bulge.",70270,4
70270,You don't even want to see my back fat.,70270,4
70270,"I think with an appropriate sweater though it will be fine, since it isn't tight in the stomach or below.",70270,4
70270,"If possible, I'll order an extra size up next time.",70270,4
70270,"Overall, I can't complain about a dress that I only paid $4 for.",70270,4
70270,"If you need a cheap maxi dress for daily use, I definitely recommend grab if this one.",70270,4
70271,"I believe it's a European cut,  bottoms don't cover much.",70271,4
70271,But other than that it's nice for the price.,70271,4
70272,"It fits great, but it's looong.",70272,4
70273,"Little big for me, but hat is adjustable and works just fine.",70273,4
70274,Snall was still too big for my 15 year daughter.,70274,4
70274,Other than that she loved it,70274,4
70276,Good boys shoes for price.,70276,4
70278,material is very thin but it fits perfect!,70278,4
70279,It was a very great quality item but I was sent the wrong size.,70279,4
70280,"These pjs are super cute, but like other reviews stated, they do run small.",70280,4
70280,I ordered my son who just turned 2 a size 4T and the arms are pretty snug.,70280,4
70281,"The colors, the print are as shown in the picture.",70281,4
70281,I got exactly what I thought I was buying and the price combined with free shipping is a great deal.,70281,4
70282,Love the design and fabric.,70282,4
70283,Fits well and looks great!,70283,4
70284,looks just like pictured,70284,4
70285,"I like this shirt, even if it's a bit snugger than I expected.",70285,4
70285,It's comfortable to wear and the colors are nicer than in the picture.,70285,4
70285,"All in all, I'm glad I got the shirt.",70285,4
70286,"Even with a stomach, it looks lovely on me.",70286,4
70286,"I paired it with some high-waisted skinny jeans, looks wonderful!",70286,4
70286,"Comfortable material, slightly worried with it being a slightly thin material that a belt would make holes in it after a few wears so I suggest no belts to keep this shirt super cute",70286,4
70288,"I have an issue where I am a really tiny person with a tiny chest but have a huge bum, so I ordered the medium and the top fits perfectly but the bottoms are very tight.",70288,4
70288,I can tell though that if they fit me correctly they would have good coverage.,70288,4
70288,This suit is a great value and I really cute so I'm going to try to order a larger size just so I can have a top and bottom that fit!,70288,4
70289,"However, the pants do run small.",70289,4
70289,I ended up with a size medium for my 11 year old son who is very thin and it was a perfect fit.,70289,4
70289,"It is great for that extra layer on cold, windy and wet days!",70289,4
70290,Weird fabric but cute,70290,4
70291,Fits well and has a nice shape to it - it isn't a sack.,70291,4
70291,The material is a little thin and clingy though - not ideal for hiding my tummy pooch!,70291,4
70292,"I got my dress yesterday, very fast.",70292,4
70292,"The dress is just as shown in the pictures, I'm very excited to wear it for my wedding.",70292,4
70292,"Is beautiful, is very sparkly even without the rhinestones.",70292,4
70292,I'll have to do a few modifications cause its somewhat large.,70292,4
70292,I'll post pictures after the wedding.,70292,4
70293,"Great bottle, a little narrow in the toe",70293,4
70294,The bracelet is awesome and looks exactly like the picture.,70294,4
70294,Its definitely five star worthy.,70294,4
70294,What isn't five star worthy is the way it was packaged.,70294,4
70294,This bracelet had a long journey to get to me and it was just thrown in a bag and a label slapped on.,70294,4
70294,Luckily it didn't break.,70294,4
70295,This dress Is really cute!,70295,4
70295,its longer than I expected but it fits really well all over.,70295,4
70295,I want to get an underbust corset to wear with it.,70295,4
70296,These are warmer socks but definitely not ski socks.,70296,4
70297,I would give it 5 stars but the material is slippery nylon - like athletic shirts and leggings.,70297,4
70297,I was expecting cotton or cotton blend .,70297,4
70297,I should have read description carefully.,70297,4
70297,I still like it a lot especially for the price..,70297,4
70298,"The necklace is very light honeycombed metal with rounded smooth surfaces and is much lighter than the pendant that's hanging on it, which actually works out great, because it hangs flat and still.",70298,4
70298,"The turquoise looks and feels a little suspect, but feels cold and mildly heavy, so I'm not certain it's real, but the coloring and detail looks great, but isn't shiny like the picture, at all.",70298,4
70298,"It's more of a flat, chalky finish.",70298,4
70298,"It's under $5, so how can I complain?",70298,4
70298,"Earrings are a match, though a little understated.",70298,4
70298,"Mine have a few dents and some uneven background finishing in the black antiquing area around the stones, which means one earring looks a little silver, around the stone, and one has the blacker antiquing detail.",70298,4
70298,"I will use a black marker to even it out and no one will know, except you guys!",70298,4
70299,Hoping to use as a back-up/replacement shoulder strap.,70299,4
70299,"I ordered the ""Khaki"" and it looks like the ""Army Green"" -- including the pad.",70299,4
70299,"I will order the ""Coffee"" and see if I get a medium to dark brown.",70299,4
70299,"Then I will decide which of the straps, if any, I will keep.",70299,4
70300,"Works as promised, shipped quickly - very cute!",70300,4
70302,I received it last week.,70302,4
70302,I liked it good material an fits perfect.,70302,4
70302,Only thing I did not like was that it was see through.,70302,4
70302,"But other than that, it's nice.",70302,4
70303,Fit good and read well.,70303,4
70304,it took a while to figure out all the pieces but its a good quality for the price and pretty easy to wear one you get all the pieces together.,70304,4
70304,its a little hard to keep the leg straps up so you may have to readjust it a few times throughout the day.,70304,4
70305,"Fits very nice but I should have gotten a 3x because its very form fitting,,,therwise I love it!!",70305,4
70306,This was really close to five stars but I really don't like the comb on top instead of the sides.,70306,4
70306,The comb feels a little weak like it can break easily but I'm hoping it won't.,70306,4
70306,I didn't have a chance to wear it yet but hopefully it holds up.,70306,4
70306,It's gorgeous and I can't wait to look like a princess with this on.,70306,4
70307,I wear a size 12 and got this in large.,70307,4
70307,The fit is perfect and the pant is quite comfortable.,70307,4
70307,I washed them and they didn't shrink.,70307,4
70307,"They do wrinkle quite badly in the groin area, so I wear a longer top to offset this issue.",70307,4
70308,Looks exactly as pictured and decent quality for the price.,70308,4
70308,However it does run a little large.,70308,4
70308,"Some reviews stated the garters were really long but I think they are fine considering I am short, if it is worn up at the waist like it shows , not sitting lower on the hips they aren't too long.",70308,4
70309,"Awesome beginner bdsm kit, definitely needs to be reinforced a bit to prevent tearing during more rough sessions.",70309,4
70309,"Overall, for the price and quality, as well as how many pieces you get for your dollar, I'd recommend for those just trying to get into the bdsm world.",70309,4
70310,Loved the color and detailing.,70310,4
70310,After first wash the center piece flower came off.,70310,4
70310,It was just stuck with some gum.,70310,4
70310,"The material is soft enough, the upper part really feels like good quality satin.",70310,4
70310,the frills are nice and puffy.,70310,4
70310,My then one year old is tiny.,70310,4
70310,Really skinny n small - Bought her 18 months and she was looks FABOOSH .. !,70310,4
70310,made her look little bit more healthy than she really is and the color gave her a nice shine and grace.,70310,4
70310,Color is exactly as shown in the picture,70310,4
70311,"I like them, but they run small!",70311,4
70312,I love this beanie alot.,70312,4
70312,Only reason I give 4/5 stars is because I thought it was going to be a little more form fitting.,70312,4
70312,It fits my head yes but if i move just a little it slides off.,70312,4
70312,"Therefore, I have to use bobby pins to pin it to my head and it blends in so it all works out and looks amazing!",70312,4
70312,just wish I wasn't forced to use the bobby pins.,70312,4
70313,Looks nice and clips my tie to my shirt.,70313,4
70314,I like this bag a lot.,70314,4
70314,It is has lots of room.,70314,4
70314,I do however wish that it had a inside pocket or two.,70314,4
70314,Other then that it is perfect for my needs.,70314,4
70315,The buttons nearly fell off imediately.,70315,4
70315,I'm also 5'3 and I felt like this suit was nearly too short for my torso.,70315,4
70315,All that being said it is rather cute.,70315,4
70317,The slip is a little too short for the dress.,70317,4
70318,Very lightweight and holds alot.,70318,4
70319,little loose around shoulders areas.,70319,4
70320,I had to return the shirt originally for a different size.,70320,4
70320,The replacement was sent very quickly and just what I needed.,70320,4
70321,Love the shoes but they're pretty narrow,70321,4
70322,"Nice fabric, beautiful color.",70322,4
70322,It's a little tight in the tummy.,70322,4
70323,I bought this as part of a gift for my grand daughter  who just turned 7 and she loved it.,70323,4
70323,The arms and length were a little bit short but it was not by much.,70323,4
70323,So I would definitely say it was somewhat small but not by a huge deal where it was obvious I needed to get a bigger size.,70323,4
70324,This is my husband's second Soleus GPS Fit Watch and he really likes it.,70324,4
70324,"The GPS is a little difficult to catch sometimes, but that's not the watch, probably more where we live.",70324,4
70324,The band is very comfortable and durable.,70324,4
70324,The watch has many good features.,70324,4
70325,"However, the zipper didn't work properly.",70325,4
70325,I had to take it to a seamstress to get a new one.,70325,4
70325,I'm 5'6 and the gown was extremely long.,70325,4
70326,"Used for a pageant, thanks.",70326,4
70327,Looks great on - only complaint is that it doesn't breathe & is hot to wear.,70327,4
70327,"I wore it to an outdoor party & roasted, but wore it to an air conditioned restaurant and was fine.",70327,4
70328,it looks like a dress but fits more like a shirt.,70328,4
70328,It has to be worn with some kind of baby romper or leggings.. or pants.,70328,4
70328,but very very cute.,70328,4
70328,"Also you might want to sew the lollipop down, it isn't attached well.",70328,4
70328,but not a big deal if you don't mind sewing it on.,70328,4
70329,I really wanted to keep this suit - It was super cute.,70329,4
70329,"I love the pinstriped top, which I haven't seen anywhere else.",70329,4
70329,"The shorts were such an improvement over the usual brief, bikini or clingy skirt options, and would pair well with other swim pieces.",70329,4
70329,Sadly the sizing just didn't work.,70329,4
70329,The top was a bit big.,70329,4
70329,"But since the shorts were a bit small (could be my shape's fault), I can't order a smaller size.",70329,4
70329,Would love it if they sold the pieces separately so could get the perfect size.,70329,4
70329,Terrific suit - just not on my body.,70329,4
70330,Pretty but little larger than I thought it would be...probably could have ordered large.,70330,4
70330,It comes out of dryer wrinkle looking.,70330,4
70330,However it it nice lounger,70330,4
70331,A bit see through but fine with a workout bra.,70331,4
70331,The material is very soft and comfortable.,70331,4
70331,I bought it to work out in but it's so comfy I might get another to lounge in.,70331,4
70332,Ordered the wrong top.,70332,4
70332,"My fault, not theirs",70332,4
70333,"The jacket fits perfectly, I do suggest taking your measurements to assure you order the right side.",70333,4
70333,The jacket is made of less than perfect material but for $30 it's a good deal.,70333,4
70333,I don't think it will last for years but again it was $30.,70333,4
70333,Looks good for the price.,70333,4
70334,Works great on UV protection.,70334,4
70334,Wish they can make it more beautiful.,70334,4
70335,Weirdly tight at the bottom hem.,70335,4
70335,"Stops me having to tuck it into my jeans to blouse it out, but a strange cut.",70335,4
70336,Pretty but  they do not stay up.,70336,4
70336,"too bad, I like the look but they just won't stay up no matter how hard I pinch them",70336,4
70337,"After reading the reviews saying to buy a size larger, I did and wished I went with my gut and got normal size.",70337,4
70337,Mine look exactly like the picture and they definitely stretch out.,70337,4
70337,They fit perfect the first hour and then stretch into a little too loose.,70337,4
70337,"But then they look a little more like boyfriend jeans, so overall still look cute.",70337,4
70338,"I love these earrings, and I'm so glad that I ordered them.",70338,4
70338,"They are a bit bigger than I hoped they would be, though.",70338,4
70339,I am really loving fun leggings right now and these fit that bill completely.,70339,4
70339,The only complaint I have is that they are slightly sheer when I squat or bend over but I have come up with a solution.,70339,4
70339,I am wearing my UA compression shorts underneath which should resolve that issue.,70339,4
70339,"Other than that these have a fun Batman graphic and I liked the way they made my legs look (the way the cape billows actually enhanced my leg muscles) These are ""super"" fun and I recommend them!",70339,4
70340,Love the material and fit but awfully expensive...I even bought on Cyber Monday but not much of a sale.,70340,4
70341,"Will dry out over time, keep oiled with cedar oil.",70341,4
70342,"I like them, soft silky easy o get on and a waist band that looks good.",70342,4
70343,But I am busty and have this problem with a lot of clothes.,70343,4
70343,"I am very small every where else so I thought if I get a bigger size it would be ok, but this jacket is form fitted so be careful if you have hips too !",70343,4
70344,My son plays HS football and was resistant to high tops because of the weight.,70344,4
70344,I purchased these because they were lighter.,70344,4
70344,He lIves them and gets the advantage of ankle support.,70344,4
70344,They dry much faster than his old cleats.,70344,4
70344,The disadvantage is the actual cleat/bottom is molded vs studs.,70344,4
70345,This jacket is wonderful!,70345,4
70345,the color is just what i expected and the quality is amazing.,70345,4
70345,I just wish the arms were a bit bigger,70345,4
70346,I'm 175lb and 5'3 it fits nicely.,70346,4
70347,Had a great success this Halloween season while Trick or Treating with my kids.,70347,4
70348,Really liked this dress but unfortunately I'm too fat for it lol :/,70348,4
70349,I'm petite and I order a small.,70349,4
70350,"These run big, but are a great value for the price.",70350,4
70351,"I can't speak to it's longevity, having only owned it for 2 days, but this wallet is super cute!",70351,4
70351,"Of course, my 7 year old had no idea what the film strip on the back was, haha.",70351,4
70353,Very satisfied with this purchase.,70353,4
70353,"For the price, it was what I expected.",70353,4
70353,"I am 5'8"" and the skirt length was borderline long.",70353,4
70353,"Also, being tall, I am long-waisted and the peplum top was a little too short so I wore a black came under it which kept midrif from being exposed every time I lifted my arms.",70353,4
70353,Just an FYI: the piece of black 'netting' that appears as being attached to the hat....isn't.,70353,4
70353,I sewed it on by hand as I felt it was a necessary feature of the costume.,70353,4
70353,I also altered the skirt front into a large scallop because I wanted to wear a pair of those cute black and emerald green striped tights that made the costume a little more fun.,70353,4
70353,"All in all, it was a good value for the price and if you happen to know how to use a needle and thread.....you are golden.",70353,4
70354,I need to order another one that's a bit smaller but for now I'm wearing this one.....I'm between sizes,70354,4
70355,Pretty but a bit big on me.,70355,4
70356,"I'm 6' 1"" 220 lbs and the extra large fit perfectly.",70356,4
70356,"As others have pointed out, the pattern does not match on both sides of the zipper, but that is not much of a big deal to me.",70356,4
70357,I have been very happy with the bands.,70357,4
70357,"Since I wear a uniform for work,  the band allows me to continue wearing my uniform pants.",70357,4
70358,"I'm a size 34b bust, my bottom is like a size 27/28.",70358,4
70358,"Medium fit me just fine, but there was not as much string length on the bikini as I would like.",70358,4
70358,When tied up it gave me about an inch of string to dangle.,70358,4
70358,Also the string was kinda stiff and not stretchy.,70358,4
70358,The bikini was lined but there is no padding to cover the nips up either.,70358,4
70358,I chose the navy blue so hopefully the dark color can hide it better.,70358,4
70358,"For the price, looks cute, and for fine.",70358,4
70358,Would not recomend to anyone with a curvy body type.,70358,4
70359,"Came In early, SOOO CUTE, I'm in LOVE with it.",70359,4
70359,just a little scared the back might peel hopefully it doesn't but besides that it's SUPER cute and perfect,70359,4
70360,I do love this top.,70360,4
70360,My one complaint is that the elastic inside around the middle is itchy on my skin.,70360,4
70360,My skin is super sensitive so that could be why.,70360,4
70360,I need to wear a camisole under the top so I'm not constantly wanting to scratch my sides.,70360,4
70360,The fabric is beautiful and it's a unique design.,70360,4
70360,Elegant and yet comfortable.,70360,4
70361,The product was delivered as expected and no damages to the item.,70361,4
70361,"It is a comfortable stretch fabric, but too many hooks to pull together.",70361,4
70361,It does contour the midsection like it is suppose to do.,70361,4
70362,this is suppose to be a loose fitting top so it does have a lot of material and it's a crop top so it is high cut and it's made of a light material,70362,4
70363,I received several compliments for this tasteful and modest swim dress.,70363,4
70363,"Wearing it helped me feel comfortable in the pool, less self conscious, while making me feel ladylike.",70363,4
70363,"The fit was just right for my body size, although, as expected, it was a bit tight around my chest.",70363,4
70363,"I enjoy it so, I am considering purchasing a second in a different print!",70363,4
70364,"The necklace adjusts easily and the pendant is exactly how it pictured, very happy I purchased and I would buy again ( I should give this a bad review because I don't want to see anyone else wearing it) LOL",70364,4
70365,The fascinatior said it came with headband instead came in a clip.,70365,4
70365,I was expecting a headband.,70365,4
70365,It fits nicely besides not coming with headband.,70365,4
70366,"These are fun ""face"" adult stickers for that special night out ""on the town!""",70366,4
70368,"The cardigan is beautiful, I received it as a gift.",70368,4
70368,My only complaint is the sleeves are too narrow.,70368,4
70368,I can't roll or scooch them up.,70368,4
70368,Other than that I really like it.,70368,4
70369,what you see is what you get,70369,4
70370,I like these because they're solid and made well.,70370,4
70370,"The reason I didn't give 5 stars:
One earring isn't formed correctly and slips out, the ""flare"" is a little less prominent.",70370,4
70370,"I can't wear them to bed, and they're also a little on the heavier side, so I don't know if it's the agate or what, because I have a lot of stone plugs and they don't seem as heavy.",70370,4
70372,"The stffer lin reduces one star, but handwashing will reduce this new feeling.",70372,4
70372,"The pants fit my 5'3"" fram wonderfully, and sho just like the pictures.",70372,4
70372,"Pair with a solid tee, and you have a darling casual look.",70372,4
70372,I will buy again.,70372,4
70372,I get so many compliments on these and the others I bought.,70372,4
70372,I did not get these for a promotion.,70372,4
70372,I paid full price and simply love them.,70372,4
70374,fits ok wash well no shrinkage would buy again,70374,4
70375,"I went be reviews and sized up,and I shouldn't have.",70375,4
70375,Had to return the dress.,70375,4
70375,"It is very cute, though.",70375,4
70375,"A little shorter than I like as a ""mature"" woman, but really flattering.",70375,4
70375,Go by your regular size.,70375,4
70375,It's stretchy and forgiving.,70375,4
70376,Such a pretty dress.,70376,4
70376,I'm 5'7 and a size 20.,70376,4
70376,The 2x fits pefectly.,70376,4
70376,The top and waist fit like it was made for me (Being busty the strech in the fabric helps).,70376,4
70376,Wish the skirt was an inch or two longer.,70376,4
70376,"Solid, comfy fabric with a bit of give.",70376,4
70376,The print is stunning on this dress.,70376,4
70376,The belt that comes with it is cheap and isn't worthy of the dress.,70376,4
70376,I suggest getting a better quality belt.,70376,4
70376,Pretty dress worth its price.,70376,4
70377,Its smaller (shorter) then I was hoping it would be but it still fits nicely.,70377,4
70378,Was bought as a gift.,70378,4
70378,Very nice product and it seems sturdy.,70378,4
70379,They hold up well and do a great job holding in solids but run a bit small.,70379,4
70379,Not for babies with chunky thighs!,70379,4
70379,They're too tight on my little guy,70379,4
70380,"it was fine, they ordered the wrong size for me...",70380,4
70381,But its def good material..* think i jst ordered it too small,70381,4
70382,I got my regular size and felt like I was wearing boats on my feet!,70382,4
70382,They were about an inch too long and very wide.,70382,4
70382,"I have a wide foot, but this was REALLY wide!",70382,4
70382,Sent them back for a size smaller and they fit pretty well except they still felt big.,70382,4
70382,I put on a pair of shorty socks and the shoes fit perfect!,70382,4
70382,"However, I got these to just slip on and off to go get the mail or to make a quick run somewhere.",70382,4
70382,"I got a pair of sole inserts because I wasn't crazy about how the bottom of the shoes feel on my feet, kind of rough...and they made all the difference in the world.",70382,4
70382,"The inserts are thin gel, and made the bottom much more comfortable and helped take up some of the room in the shoes and now I really like them!",70382,4
70383,Love the hat n style.,70383,4
70383,"I do have a large head, fits but is snug.",70383,4
70386,Very comfortable and I got compliments,70386,4
70387,"Great product, works fine.",70387,4
70387,One thing is it could be more sturday as far as the side folding in and out (it kept falling off my kid's face)... other than that it's a winner.,70387,4
70388,It is nice and elegant,70388,4
70389,HUGE pirate statement necklace gets compliments every time i put it on. ',70389,4
70389,But... many of my friends are very piratey.,70389,4
70392,I like it and wear it a lot but it is thin.,70392,4
70392,Probably get about 10 acceptable wears out of it.,70392,4
70393,"Great quality, arrived within reasonable time but a little smaller than expected.",70393,4
70393,The colour of the bag is burgundy and not brown as stated but I absolutely love it.,70393,4
70394,Arrived 2 weeks earlier than ecpected.,70394,4
70394,"I usually wear a medium, but u read on a previous review to get one size up anF I'm glad I did.",70394,4
70394,"It is high cut around the leg area, only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the material is a little ser through and it isn't double layered like most suits are.",70394,4
70394,"Luckily I sew, so I'll just do it myself.",70394,4
70394,Really that's my only cimplaint.!,70394,4
70395,"It's a little long especially since I'm a girl but I needed it for work, got lots of compliments!",70395,4
70396,It's thin which was what I expected.,70396,4
70396,It's great because it can be wore then work slakes or jeans.,70396,4
70396,You can dress it up or down!,70396,4
70397,Got this as a gag gift for my friend.,70397,4
70397,"She bought me a skimpy, corny sexy nurse lingerie set so I got her back with this because she went to Catholic school.",70397,4
70397,"For the price, you get quite a lot actually, comes with the red fishnet stockings too and I find that it's rare for these kinds of products to ever include those.",70397,4
70397,Fit me well and we're the same size.,70397,4
70397,She thought it was funny so that's all that matters.,70397,4
70397,I hope she gets some use out of it haha.,70397,4
70398,Shirt fits very well but the skirt is waaaaaaaaaaay too short it barely covers my butt so I will barely be using it except for the bedroom.,70398,4
70398,Low quality stitching and fabric but it doers look cute in pictures.,70398,4
70398,Quality is better than a Walmart Halloween costume but its not quite up to par with normal clothing.,70398,4
70398,Definitely a costume but it still looks cute.,70398,4
70398,"Edit 4/21/15
I purchased the Deep blue version (again short sleeved) and the navy skirt is at least an inch longer than the pink one AND fits my 36in hips rather than my 29in waist and I ordered the same size (XL).",70398,4
70398,It means either the pink is meant to be smaller or they have listened to reviews and made them longer.,70398,4
70398,But given the quality of this outfit I'd say it varies by the color you purchase.,70398,4
70398,I'm actually much more pleased with the deep blue than I am the pink though just because I can wear the skirt to a con with out attracting unwanted attention.,70398,4
70399,"The size reviews are correct, I wear a LRG & this MED is perfect.",70399,4
70399,"It's not a true Military Spec jacket, but it's a darn close 2nd.",70399,4
70399,I would get it again.,70399,4
70400,Wardrobe malfunction on day one.,70400,4
70400,"I was walking to the coffee shop, with my phone in my front pocket, when I felt the phone slither down my leg.",70400,4
70400,There was a huge hole in the pocket.,70400,4
70400,I will fix it myself instead of returning them.,70400,4
70400,"Otherwise, the fit is good, they have a nice amount of stretch, and are cute.",70400,4
70401,"Love it, love it!",70401,4
70402,Love the print and the color.,70402,4
70402,Zipper pulls came off 2nd day.,70402,4
70403,"The fit is a bit strange, the arms are oddly tight for an XL, so it's not really suitable for layering.",70403,4
70404,Thin but very nice,70404,4
70407,Good for a few months before it broke--was only like $1.00 :),70407,4
70408,"too big for my daughters wrist, but pretty.",70408,4
70409,It is a thicker material than I expected which is good.,70409,4
70409,It is not see thru.,70409,4
70409,I ordered the white but was sent an ivory.,70409,4
70409,"I do not have time to return it for the correct color, I need it here to take on vacation next week.",70409,4
70410,"Fits perfect, well made but DHL delivery took much longer than expected.",70410,4
70411,This thing works great for your cards.,70411,4
70411,I don't use it for my folding money as I don't care for that part of it.,70411,4
70411,The slide out plastic window holds my not so important cards.,70411,4
70411,I use that part for punch cards and paper type cards that are not important.,70411,4
70411,I do love the credit card dispenser.,70411,4
70411,Really slick how it stacks the cards so you can pick the one you want.,70411,4
70412,I'm Normally small and ordered an xs and it fits great.,70412,4
70412,"The material is a stretchy fabric which is why I'm giving 4 stars, I think cotton would look better.",70412,4
70412,Otherwise I definitely recommend,70412,4
70413,The bracelet is super cute!,70413,4
70413,I got the white one and one of the wings is turned upside down from the other one so it looks kinda weird.,70413,4
70413,But other than that it is great!,70413,4
70415,"fits well, looks nice.",70415,4
70415,"Not the highest quality, but I didn't expect it to be.",70415,4
70415,I only need it to last a few months while I am preggers anyways,70415,4
70416,I had heel spurs pretty badly and this was a great relief on my feet.,70416,4
70416,I especially love using them in my Zumba shoes.,70416,4
70416,I am a Zumba Instructor and teaching so often can be hard on your feet and these offered extra support.,70416,4
70416,The only thing is that they wear out quickly.,70416,4
70416,The upper layer starts to separate from the bottom layer and they become unusable.,70416,4
70416,This happens too quickly and they are expensive.,70416,4
70417,Heat is a little small for my son he is a month and a half with a 36cm  head.,70417,4
70417,The heat is tight,70417,4
70418,Unique design with a soft and stretch material.,70418,4
70418,Lightweight with a cheap price tag and expensive feel and look tee.,70418,4
70418,"Fitted around arms, which is what my man prefers but a comfortable fit around rest of body and length to match.",70418,4
70418,"There is a musty, baby urine diaper smell to it.",70418,4
70418,I used color safe bleach and liquid fabric softener and it seemed to not smell as pungent.,70418,4
70418,I received this product at a discount in exchange for honest review.,70418,4
70419,5'7 and I ordered a S which fit perfectly.,70419,4
70419,"I have wide hips, so the cut of the dress flattered my frame.",70419,4
70419,"I'm a little smaller in the chest area so had to pin the top, but other than that it was a great buy.",70419,4
70420,This is very  nice coat but it's very small especially the arms and I have to return it for large size,70420,4
70421,I am 5 months pregnant and I have been wearing this belly band pretty consistently since I was 3 months pregnant.,70421,4
70421,It has held up pretty well!,70421,4
70421,The belly band effectively holds up my pants (which I have to wear unbuttoned and unzipped at this point).,70421,4
70421,"I knocked off one star because after consistent use, the band has stretched out a bit in the hip area, so it rolls up every now and then depending on what material pants I am wearing.",70421,4
70422,This is a super cute suit!,70422,4
70422,I am a size 14 and I bought the 12/14 & I found it to be quite big.,70422,4
70422,I got the 8/10 instead and it fit much better.,70422,4
70422,I also have a larger bust and I find it to be lacking in support a little.,70422,4
70422,But Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.,70422,4
70423,Pretty good and pretty fast,70423,4

70425,"Nice dress, comfortable, little see through with the white one but fine with nude colored underwear",70425,4
70426,Definitely worth it for the money.,70426,4

70435,"Super comfy, look almost like real jeans.",70435,4
70435,"Slightly see through, so you can wear black hose underneath to get the opaque look.",70435,4
70437,This is a great bag.,70437,4
70437,It has many pockets to help you put things into that you need quickly.,70437,4
70437,You don't have to search the large area and get frustrated that you can't find them.,70437,4
70438,Super cute and comfortable.,70438,4
70439,This is a really nice jacket,70439,4
70441,Everyone said to order a size or so up so I did and boy were they right.,70441,4

But i think its too long for short girls like me",70446,4
70448,I was looking for some more leggings and wasn't wanting to pay a lot of money.,70448,4
70448,"I am 5ft and medium build so finding pants that fit right sometimes can be a challenge, more so due to length.",70448,4
70448,I was very happy with these leggings.,70448,4
70448,Great Material (not see through)!!,70448,4
70449,"Love it, but it tangles through the day.",70449,4

70453,Base friction/grip less for babies.,70453,4
70454,"I want to leave an honest review on this wallet, I enjoy buying from Amazon's website, the wallet is small and light, only time will tell if the material will hold up.",70454,4
70454,My old school leather wallet was bigger and heavier.,70454,4
70454,Lasted 3 years and the wallet show wear and had tears.,70454,4
70454,"This one is lite, I do recommend the one with the window for your driver license or id.",70454,4
70454,"that would be about 5 dollars more and worth every bit,  There are only 6 pockets for business cards or credit cards, so that limits on how many cards you can carry at one time.",70454,4
70454,It will hold every bit of a few hundred in us currency.,70454,4
70454,"This wallet is sleek and slim, the materials that made this wallet seems to be of good quality as well.",70454,4

70456,Its perfect for everyday wear.,70456,4
70456,The only issue that I noticed was that there was a little chip on the side of one of the t's and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.,70456,4
70456,Other than that it's a great bracelet and you should definitely order one.,70456,4

70459,"I'm a 5' 6"", slim, 150lbs male.",70459,4
70459,"I bought the US Medium, and although it fits me snugly, the sleeves are about 2 inches too long.",70459,4
70459,"If they had a small size I'm betting the sleeves would have fit perfectly, but then the rest of the would have been too small.",70459,4
70459,The material and quality is excellent though!,70459,4
70460,The size fit good but the neckline was an awkward fit and was uncomfortable for me.,70460,4

70468,I love this mask.,70468,4
70468,"It took fewer than three weeks to arrive, which was about a month before the expected delivery date.",70468,4
70468,"There were some hot glue strings on the front, as other reviewers have noted, but they were easy to remove.",70468,4
70468,"The flower was a little squished, but it's still a nice-looking flower and doesn't matter much when wearing a wig.",70468,4
70468,"There is some uncovered clear plastic on the tip of the nose, but it's clear and it's not enough to bother me.",70468,4
70468,The mask fits comfortably and looks great for my Kanae (Tokyo Ghoul :re) cosplay.,70468,4

70474,It does look & feel good.,70474,4
70475,Looks pretty much like the photo but a little itchy and smelt weird soon as I got the product but a good product overall,70475,4
70476,Love the sz of chain and the color of stone .,70476,4
70476,Very well made .,70476,4
70477,"Great dress, though it is more of a coral color than pink.",70477,4
70478,Cute top and looks just like the picture.,70478,4
70478,It was delivered on time.,70478,4
70478,I'm a petite person and the one size fits all it slight bigger than what I would like.,70478,4

70482,The collar was size larger than normal.,70482,4
70482,I ordered size 15 1/2 for my husband but it came out as 16.,70482,4

70485,Looks great with bikini top.,70485,4
70485,"Although I am normally a size Large (12), I ordered a size 14 as bathing suits tend to run small.",70485,4

70507,Supr cute but be aware this is EU sizing.,70507,4
70507,I am a 20 US and got a 22 thinking it would be a little loose.,70507,4
70507,It is a little tight.,70507,4
70507,Should've got the 24.,70507,4
70508,Like the shirt =^_^=,70508,4
70509,Typically I would assume pants like this would be fairly heavy and not practical for wearing in the summer.,70509,4
70509,"These are actually quite light weight, to the point I do wish they were somewhat thicker as I am afraid the thin material may affect their longevity.",70509,4
70509,All seams are triple sewn so should hold together fairly well however.,70509,4
70510,"Way too small for me 5'4"" 155 ... so I gave it to friend who is 5'3"" 110, she loves it",70510,4
70511,I liked these slippers for barre class.,70511,4
70511,They were a little slippery for yoga.,70511,4
70512,"Is more of top than a dress, and I am only 5' 3""",70512,4
70513,"Comfortable, but very large in the legs.",70513,4
70516,seem to be quality.,70516,4
70517,Abbbbbbsooolluuuteeelllly Gaaaaawwwjuss love my stainless steel  ring  ...,70517,4
70518,"Daughter is a fan of the show, very hard to find stuff in US, so she loves this when I gave it to her",70518,4
70519,A little small over the hips.,70519,4
70520,they look like they are way to small but they fit as described.,70520,4
70520,Colors are vibrant and wash and wear well!,70520,4
70521,I ended up giving this dress to my daughter because the cut actually fits juniors and not women sizes.,70521,4
70521,"Taking into consideration that my daughter is enjoying the dress, I give it 5 stars, but because I purchased the dress for myself and it didn't fit, I subtract a star, which results in a 4 out of 5 star rating.",70521,4
70522,Besides it needs a really good alteration(super long for my size even with high hills  ) is true to the size and amazingly amazing!,70522,4
70522,I wear size 4 90% of when I buy dresses and I did same here and fits so perfectly.,70522,4
70522,"The only reason I giving 4 stars is b/c of being so  long, If you're okay with paying some extra $$ for that go for it ladies I highly recommend.",70522,4
70524,Too big for my 2-3month old babies,70524,4
70525,Overall I'm a super happy with these leggings.,70525,4
70525,Did my workout today in them and they held up well.,70525,4
70525,"Super thick and and stretchy, no issues with you booty showing through when you bend over during deadlifts or squats.",70525,4
70525,Only sad part is they are super short if you are a tall girl these will be highwaters.,70525,4
70525,"I'm 5'8"" and athletic build (meaning I have leg muscles and booty) and they ride about halfway between my ankle and calf.",70525,4
70525,Will order other styles because I think they are a great product.,70525,4
70526,"Ordered xl, a little snug for xl.",70526,4
70527,"Saw this same skirt on another site, but they wanted $65 for it.",70527,4
70527,Love the skirt and want to get one more color,70527,4
70528,I love the style and how it looks on me.,70528,4
70528,My only issue is the sharp edges it has.,70528,4
70530,"Nice dress, however the material was not as I would have expected.",70530,4
70530,It is really a pretty dress for a cruise or beach house party.,70530,4
70530,The green is soft and easy on the eyes.,70530,4
70531,It's a bit too large but I can wear just the same.,70531,4
70532,Just a tad smaller (IMHO) than XL.,70532,4
70532,Gave it to my son and ordered the 2XL.,70532,4
70533,I love this slim wallet.,70533,4
70533,I have used this type of Dopp wallet for years.,70533,4
70533,It has all the slots that I need.,70533,4
70533,My only complaint is that I ordered the RFID protected version but have no way of knowing if that is what I received.,70533,4
70533,I have found no where on the wallet that identifies it as being protected.,70533,4
70533,I hope it is or I've got a problem.,70533,4
70534,Bought for a charity gift and it fit me(i'm a small) ...request for was for a large.,70534,4
70534,Returned it ...it is a cute top if it fits!,70534,4
70536,This Cute Fascinator was the perfect color.,70536,4
70536,I have fine hair and the clip did not hold it in my hair.,70536,4
70536,I bought a headband and attached it to the Fascinator.,70536,4
70537,thread coming loose on the first day.,70537,4
70537,Fit ok though and the colors are bright.,70537,4
70537,He loves it so I'm not gonna sweat it.,70537,4
70538,"I have a smaller bust so I will have to stitch the ""v"" a tiny bit; Also, I absolutely cannot zip it all the way up by myself.",70538,4
70538,That's the only reason I'm giving 4stars instead of 5.,70538,4
70539,"Arrived sooner than expected, but is a poorer quality than I had expected.",70539,4
70540,Really like the fit and the comfort,70540,4
70541,Material and look are good.,70541,4
70541,The fit is way bigger than other brands.,70541,4
70541,I usually wear a 17 around my neck and it is a nice fit.,70541,4
70541,This shirt in 17 was about 3/4 of an inch too big.,70541,4
70541,I should have bought 16.5.,70541,4
70542,Great for sleepwear in the hot summer!,70542,4
70543,"very nice dress pant, I had to returned because of the length.",70543,4
70544,I'd say this is a flattering suit for almost any shape/size.,70544,4
70544,"The cups are a pain in the rear - the padding inside folds up constantly and it makes the top very ""boxy"" looking.",70544,4
70544,I have to constantly fix/re-adjust them.,70544,4
70544,"All in all, the suit is pretty TTS and very comfortable.",70544,4
70544,"I'm not generally a fan of the tie-back tops, they tend to pull on my neck.",70544,4
70544,"However, it is pretty comfortable and the straps are relatively substantial so they don't dig into your neck the way some do when you are larger on top.",70544,4
70544,"I don't have high hopes, however, that this suit will hold up much past one season.",70544,4
70544,"Even when pulling it on you can hear the seams kind of ""pop"" and stretch - not indicative of a well-made suit.",70544,4
70544,"But for the price, I guess I'm getting what I paid for.",70544,4
70544,I DO love the bottom (under the skirt).,70544,4
70544,"It has great coverage unlike many suit bottoms, IMO.",70544,4
70544,"They are little 'boy short' style bottoms and they don't ride up, fold, etc.",70544,4
70544,They are very comfortable and that's pretty much why I gave this suit 4 stars vs. 3 stars.,70544,4
70544,The bottoms portion of the suit is great!,70544,4
70544,"I am on the short side (5'4"") and the skirt comes down pretty long (just above my knee, really).",70544,4
70544,Much longer than expected.,70544,4
70544,But it's good coverage so I can't complain!,70544,4
70544,"I ALWAYS wear a cover-up with a swimsuit (I'm so self-conscious) but I received some compliments on the top b/c I""m not afraid to show the top of my suit/chest area (whereas a lot of suits don't give me full coverage/make me feel comfortable).",70544,4
70545,Nice classy looking cap.,70545,4
70545,"Feels nice, wears nice.",70545,4
70545,Except it has a wedge type look.,70545,4
70545,"It's not bad, just different.",70545,4
70546,"As someone who has to carry epi-pens all of the time, this purse is a great, budget-friendly solution.",70546,4
70546,"Most clutches and evening bags are too small to fit two epi-pens in them, let alone a phone and other items.",70546,4
70546,"This purse is just big enough for 2 epi-pens, an iPhone 6, a credit card, little bit of cash, and a key.",70546,4
70546,You won't be able to fit a wallet or a keychain full of keys.,70546,4
70546,"But for a night out, this purse gets the job done.",70546,4
70546,I like that the purse can be used a clutch or worn as a purse with a small chain and a large chain.,70546,4
70546,The reason I have dropped my review from 5 stars to 4 is because of the chain.,70546,4
70546,"It looks a little cheap, and the weave of the chain is perfect for catching your hair in it.",70546,4
70546,I had to carefully untangle my hair from it on a few occasions throughout the night.,70546,4
70546,I would suggest wearing your hair up if you're going to use the long chain and wear the purse across your body.,70546,4
70547,I like this dress.,70547,4
70547,It fits me perfect.,70547,4
70548,Like it a lot just wish the tank top part was as long as it appears in he picture.,70548,4
70549,"Arrived on time, daughter loves it.",70549,4
70550,For the price this is a great buy.,70550,4
70550,"When people ask me who made my shirt, I always get away with saying it's a designer label.",70550,4
70551,The neck is a full roll color so if you don't like turtle necks it's not for you.,70551,4
70552,The white was more creme colored and is very see thru so must be wore under longer tops.,70552,4
70554,It didn't really look like the photo- maple leaf was almost the size of the whole shirt.,70554,4
70554,But definitely worth it for the price,70554,4
70555,"COME IN A BARREL SHAPE, SO I HAD TO GET IT TAILORED!",70555,4
70557,perfect gift for my uncle.,70557,4
70557,"print was clear on, no smudges!",70557,4
70558,I am not sure why people are saying that the hair elastics don't stay on.,70558,4
70558,"I put a cheapie dollar-store hair tie on the bracelet I purchased, and it stays on just fine.",70558,4
70558,"This is a gift for my daughter, and she is going to love it!",70558,4
70560,"I'm 5'10"", 165, and athletic.",70560,4
70560,Love the cut and tailor.,70560,4
70560,If the collar was a little stiffer I'd give a 5/5.,70560,4
70560,"It's not a big issue a all, but I'm a tough critic.",70560,4
70560,I still wear this once a week.,70560,4
70561,Kinda itchy but works well,70561,4
70562,"Cute top, but it is too small.",70562,4
70562,The quality appears to be ok.,70562,4
70562,I wear a large in U.S.,70562,4
70564,"Lovely fit, stiff fabric so may not be so comfortable in the warmer climates/seasons.",70564,4
70564,Returning due to a defective zipper.,70564,4
70565,"I'm 5'6, 130 and it fits like a glove.",70565,4
70565,"Another 5 lbs however, will make me look like a busted can of biscuits, so yeah.",70565,4
70565,Shop carefully but enjoy!!,70565,4
70566,"I am a 36 G and ordered the XXL, fits perfectly!",70566,4
70566,I feel like if I would've ordered smaller it would've have fit.,70566,4
70566,"Feels great around the band not to tight or too loose, just wish the straps were a tad bit tighter that's all, but other than that great price, great bras, covers all of your back, Full support, oh and for the photo the I'm wearing the 4th bra which is gray.",70566,4
70567,"Nothing special about these, they are just glasses.",70567,4
70567,Maybe I like over priced.,70567,4
70567,We ended up not using them.,70567,4
70568,The case thickness is what i did not liked about it.,70568,4
70568,Other than that it is a very nice time piece.,70568,4
70569,"Tight around the under arm area, but overall I really like it.",70569,4
70570,"It looks a little less baggy on me than the picture because I'm 6ft tall and a size 14, but it's cute and comfy.",70570,4
70570,I've worn it a few times now and it doesn't show any signs of wear.,70570,4
70571,Not bad for the price.,70571,4
70571,I bought a medium and a large.,70571,4
70571,The large hung better on me.,70571,4
70571,"I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs.",70571,4
70571,"I wore this to a hipster evening wedding, and got lots of compliments.",70571,4
70571,"The front hung to loose for me, it was too showy, so I added some fabric tape to keep it together and looked great!",70571,4
70572,I really like this kimono but it runs very small.,70572,4
70572,I am a size 8-10 and normally wear a medium in misses and a large in juniors.,70572,4
70572,The XL fits fine in the back and arms but does not close in front.,70572,4
70572,It's beautiful though so I'm keeping it.,70572,4
70573,So cute and comfy.,70573,4
70573,"I'm not giving it five stars because even after one wash, the dress begins to look old and faded.",70573,4
70574,A bit lightweight but well made and good price.,70574,4
70574,Red zipper matches + looks great.,70574,4
70574,Extra little phone pocket is nice !,70574,4
70575,This tassel is fine leather and made with expert care.,70575,4
70575,"I was in hopes it was a bit larger than pictured but, I still like it anyway.",70575,4
70575,Does have a heavy duty clip on the end for secure when attaching keys to your bag.,70575,4
70575,Certainly well worth the money.,70575,4
70576,"these work as well as the adhesive ""stickers"".",70576,4
70576,however the stickers would cause my skin to peel if i wore them more than one day in a row.,70576,4
70576,i am hoping to avoid that with these ;),70576,4
70577,This bag is so cute!,70577,4
70577,Although the magnet to close the bag could be improved on.,70577,4
70577,I could fit my regular iphone 6 in it along with some money.,70577,4
70577,Its great for short outings to a friends house.,70577,4
70577,"Not something you can wear everyday unless you only carry money, a phone smaller than the regular iphone 6 or the same size and maybe some makeup stuff.",70577,4
70577,I still love it though!,70577,4
70578,Cute outfit but the length of the pants legs was ridiculously long I had to cut off several inches it couldn't be hemed any other way,70578,4
70579,This is very cute and coordinated with my pink bikini.,70579,4
70579,I was under the impression it had sleeves but it does not.,70579,4
70579,It hands loosely and is very short.,70579,4
70579,"If you are looking for thigh coverage, this product is not for you.",70579,4
70580,Very pleased with the product,70580,4
70581,Exactly as depicted ands good fit.,70581,4
70581,Doesn't look huge on the finger,70581,4
70582,My son whose favorite color is red loves these.,70582,4
70582,We ordered youth size 3,70582,4
70583,This fit well and looked great for my Bastille event I attended.,70583,4
70583,It is really long in the back (covering my butt) and shorter in the fron ( coming to my hips).,70583,4
70583,I am 5'11 with a D cup so that may have shortened the front a bit as well.,70583,4
70584,I bought this dress in Burgundy.,70584,4
70584,I like the fit of it very much.,70584,4
70584,I'm 148lbs and 12 weeks pregnant.,70584,4
70584,I bought the XL.,70584,4
70584,"It's a little too tight through the bust, but I wore a leopard scarf with it and it was cute.",70584,4
70584,"My only complaint, and it is certainly reflected in the price, is the quality of the fabric.",70584,4
70584,It was already beginning to pill slightly after the first day of wear.,70584,4
70584,I don't expect this dress to last more than a 6mos-year before it starts looking too worn.,70584,4
70584,I washed it delicate and inside out and hung to dry.,70584,4
70584,Aside from the lower quality of the fabric its a great and modest dress!,70584,4
70585,It isn't thin like many others.,70585,4
70585,The silk screening is crisp and easy to read.,70585,4
70585,I'll see how it does after a couple of washes.,70585,4
70586,Runs small for sure.,70586,4
70587,"very nice hat, a little small,that's the only thing that I regret, but it looks very nice.",70587,4
70588,I am usually size 36 waist (32 unseen).,70588,4
70588,I ordered 38x32 to be safe and am glad I did.,70588,4
70588,They fit with no room to spare.,70588,4
70588,"I have bigger than average legs, and these pants are very comfortable in the legs.",70588,4
70588,"They are thin, but feel well made.",70588,4
70588,I'm happy with them.,70588,4
70589,"Great product, but arrived later then dare and was too late for me to use on my trip.",70589,4
70590,"Good quality, a lot better look than expected.",70590,4
70591,I usually order small but read the reviews & ordered a Medium.,70591,4
70591,I'm 5'5 125lbs with C cup breasts and 38 inch booty/hips.,70591,4
70591,The top could've fit better with a large but the bottoms were ok.,70591,4
70593,I like them but they were to small and kinda narrow.,70593,4
70593,Hard time getting my toes in the proper space.,70593,4
70593,"By the size chart it said I could use a 42, but when I recieved them it had Youth on the box not womens.",70593,4
70593,So it was confusing wheter these were for youth or women size 42.,70593,4
70594,Nice and thick pajamas with dinosaurs...so cute!,70594,4
70595,"The swimsuit Looks great, but was too big, have to return it.",70595,4
70597,Very comfortable and stylish!,70597,4
70597,I am 5'10 and it was a bit short on me but otherwise great product!,70597,4
70598,"For the price, this is a decent shirt.",70598,4
70598,"It is a little short on me but I am 5'9"" so I run into that quite a bit.",70598,4
70598,I ordered both the black and the white.,70598,4
70598,I love the low cut and of course love the attention it brings.,70598,4
70598,I did notice on the black one that the front seem was crooked.,70598,4
70598,It isn't too noticeable but it bothers me.,70598,4
70600,I bought these for a costume and they delivered.,70600,4
70600,The waist band is kind of shoddy (a wide elastic band inside of the fabric) but you can't see through these when bending around which is more important to me.,70600,4
70600,They fit as expected (5'7 120lbs) ordered a small.,70600,4
70600,Now I can use these to exercise without worrying about everyone seeing my underwear.,70600,4
70600,Definitely good quality for the price.,70600,4
70601,Good product for the price,70601,4
70602,My sister brought these for her husband's nephew.,70602,4
70602,He loves them and wears them everyday to school!,70602,4
70603,"The material isn't the best quality and it's see-through but, I expected this.",70603,4
70603,It's a little smaller as well.,70603,4
70603,I was looking for a crop top though.,70603,4
70603,The back is cute-it will be a good party shirt or a summer swim cover-up,70603,4
70604,"They run a little small, but otherwise, they are adorable.",70604,4
70604,My son loves them!,70604,4
70606,"Great gift, but one of the stones fell off",70606,4
70608,Cute for what you pay!,70608,4
70611,love it veyr whimsical,70611,4
70612,Nice boxer briefs but unfortunately on the small size - I would recommend order one size up from your usual size.,70612,4
70613,But I like it a lot.,70613,4
70613,Nice and roomy and keeps you warm.,70613,4
70613,"Might have to hem the sleeves and bottom after wash, but that's an easy fix.",70613,4
70613,I do love my new sweatshirt bathrobe!,70613,4
70615,"I haven't worn this one yet, but it was as expected.",70615,4
70616,This sweater wasn't really small just snug in the arms.,70616,4
70616,That aside the look is good and is warm as long as its not windy out.,70616,4
70616,I would caution you from wearing this near hyper dogs.,70616,4
70616,My dogs nails get stuck in this sweater no matter the length.,70616,4
70617,"The stars aren't the color of blue I thought they looked like in the picture, but still pretty earrings.",70617,4
70618,"Decent product, true to size, adhesive worked for about 15-20 wears.",70618,4
70619,I don't usually wear rompers but I thought I would take a chance with this one and I'm glad I did!,70619,4
70619,It is a little bit short but still really cute and the top fits great.,70619,4
70619,I love that I can dress it down with simple flip flops for put on a cute pair of heels and wear it out to a club.,70619,4
70620,"So far so good, holds all my cards without being bulky and jamming into my asscheek.",70620,4
70621,I've purchased this swim suit in 2 colors now - it's just what I was looking for!,70621,4
70621,(Although the Euphoria Pink is a little bit more 'bubble gummy' than I'd hoped for).,70621,4
70621,"I made the purchase primarily for the tops, but the bottoms happen to fit nicely as well.",70621,4
70621,"As some have said, the bottoms are rather low cut in the front, but as expected from this style.",70621,4
70621,I'm a 36 B (size 6) and overall the Small fits perfectly.,70621,4
70621,"The padding in the top is generous, but I removed it and actually prefer it that way.",70621,4
70621,I don't find the material to be any cheaper than the average suits out there.,70621,4
70621,"For the price, can't beat it!",70621,4
70622,Cute shirts but a Lil see thru,70622,4
70625,"Haven't used it yet, looks like it will work well though.",70625,4
70625,Well made and very roomy.,70625,4
70626,"Love finding quirky, fun, cat ties for my husband (he's a school teacher).",70626,4
70626,Looks fantastic with a dress shirt and slacks for a more playful look and the kids love it.,70626,4
70626,It's even brighter looking in person.,70626,4
70626,"Haven't washed it yet but this far, it's held up after a few wears.",70626,4
70627,"The fabric and idea of this tank are cute, but in reality the cut on the medium was really boxy because of how voluminous the cut of the material was.",70627,4
70627,"It fit me, it just wasn't particularly flattering on my frame.",70627,4
70628,Very cute and comfy.,70628,4
70629,Pretty but lacks quality - you can see one of the cups under the beading at bust and the sequins/beads are not attached well.,70629,4
70631,I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it.,70631,4
70631,She wore this as a beach cover up while on vacation and received a ton of compliments!,70631,4

70636,Haven't washed it yet but like the fit.,70636,4
70637,I'm not very curvy so it is a little big on me but over all I am happy with it.,70637,4
70638,"I just wish they were thicker, like the tummy control ones.",70638,4
70638,I love the color though and fit is great!,70638,4

70649,It's not as slim fitting as you might think but it still fits nicely.,70649,4
70649,If you're a medium I wouldn't recommend buying a size up.,70649,4
70649,Overall I'm very happy with my purchase!,70649,4
70650,very pretty but really tight,70650,4
70651,They are so adorable!,70651,4
70651,"They weren't exactly as pictured, but they're very similar and good quality!",70651,4
70651,"The shipping took like a month, definitely worth it :)",70651,4
70652,Great value for the price!!!!,70652,4
70652,The only thing I wish was that the entire inside was line with hard plastic instead of just the corners.,70652,4
70652,But for this price you really can't complain!!!!,70652,4
70653,I like this whenever you really need to protect your face from sun.,70653,4
70653,Use mostly driving into sun to proct skin.,70653,4
70653,The lense is flimsy plastic and scratches easy.,70653,4
70653,I keep in a bag in car for when needed.,70653,4
70653,The visor moves up and down.,70653,4
70653,I hold both sides by hinges so it won't break.,70653,4
70653,It's much cheaper than other brands.,70653,4
70653,"Your getting exactly what you pay for, not for everyone.",70653,4
70653,If I didn't have a special need I probably could pass.,70653,4
70653,But if you need face protection this will help.,70653,4

70654,"The set includes leopard print, royal blue, black, hot pink and nude.",70654,4
70654,The belts have 6 prong holes and the buckle is your standard frame-style with prong.,70654,4

70654,I am getting a ton of use out of them.,70654,4
70654,"The order arrived quickly, but my nude belt was broken.",70654,4
70654,I contacted Bundle Monster who sent me a replacement in just a few days.,70654,4
70654,"These belts are intended for looks only, and are not very durable.",70654,4

70656,I am a 5'4'' 145 lb female and I ordered the X-L.,70656,4
70656,I should have stuck to large.,70656,4
70656,"It fits fine, but the bottom slips off sometimes if I do not pay attention and the top is a little lose around my chest.",70656,4
70657,"This knock off of a Hermes bracelet is pretty cool, although it has no logos or printing of any kind, and some people made a comment on the differed colored hardware for the rose gold, which mine has as well, but I don't mind it at all.",70657,4
70657,"I like it, and didn't mind paying only 10$.",70657,4

70658,I am a M in U.S. sizes and ordered a M.  Everyone loved the shirt!,70658,4
70660,The dress fits great and is lovely the belt is a bit on the small side,70660,4
70661,Exactly what I needed,70661,4
70662,A sweet fun necklace to wear any day,70662,4
70663,My god daughter loved it!!,70663,4
70663,Well the ice cream cookies cake & fruit punch loved it a little bit more than she did!,70663,4
70664,Very comfortable and a bit larger than expected.,70664,4
70664,Amazing top for a casual busy day or for a long distance travel.,70664,4
70665,The picture of the moon aint as in the photo but it looks the same,70665,4
70667,This romper is adorable...only drawback the zipper sticks a little bit.,70667,4
70668,Pants are well made and look very good.,70668,4
70668,I had the same problem as others did with the fit.,70668,4
70668,"I'm 5'9"" and 220 lbs.",70668,4
70668,"Waist and length are right for the XL, but the fit around the thighs is too tight.",70668,4
70668,"Wish there had been a 2XL option or another 1/2"" on the thighs and butt.",70668,4
70669,Very thin material but also very soft!,70669,4
70669,"I love wearing it with a pair of leggings, and boots!",70669,4
70669,Im not sure if i would wear it without something und e r it as it is see through but i really do love it!,70669,4
70671,Very comfortable and fits well.,70671,4
70672,Ordered a size up could have maybe went 2 sizes up.,70672,4
70672,will be fine with a sweater or jacket.,70672,4
70674,I ordered these shoes for my 7 year old daughter to wear to a Father-Daughter Dance.,70674,4
70674,They were just perfect!,70674,4
70674,They were sparkly and the jewels caught the light beautifully.,70674,4
70674,My daughter was VERY excited to wear them to the dance and couldn't stop admiring them once she put them on.,70674,4
70674,"Also, she had never worn a little heel before, so these made her feel very grown up.",70674,4
70674,"My only complaint (which is why I docked a star) is that, as is often the case in beauty, they weren't very comfortable.",70674,4
70674,"Once she arrived at the dance, she took them off after a few minutes of being on the dance floor and they mostly sat by her chair the rest of the night.",70674,4
70674,She tried to put them on a couple of times to dance in (because they were just so pretty!),70674,4
70674,but ended up taking them off after a minute or two.,70674,4
70674,"As an adult, most of my dressy shoes are uncomfortable for dancing like that too.",70674,4
70674,"Overall, I was very pleased with the shoes and the price.",70674,4
70675,I was happy to receive my very first mala beads.,70675,4
70675,Only reason I am giving it a 4 (instead of 5) stars is that it is mentioned as a necklace/bracelet so I had hoped to be able to use it in both fashions and found that it is not practical as a bracelet for my 6.5 inch wrist.,70675,4
70675,So I would suggest to the company to actually list wrist sizes that it accommodates.,70675,4
70676,"it fits my size, but it runs very small.",70676,4
70677,"as usual the garment is silky smooth, very comfortable and east care.",70677,4
70677,"am planning to get more of these style pants that adjust at the waist,able to adjust at the hem and leave ample room at the hips.",70677,4
70677,am diabetic and other pants just rub/chafe/irritate inner thigh skin causing skin issues that can morph into serious skin infection...these can also be worn as a flowing skirt that does not need hemming as well.,70677,4
70680,"Very cute, just a touch tight in the shoulders, but very cute and looks nice and just like the pictures.",70680,4
70681,"It's a wind breaker, not a hoodie.",70681,4
70681,Just the hood is fleece.,70681,4
70681,It's a little small for its size so go one up.,70681,4
70682,come in small sizes butt of pants ride low.,70682,4
70682,they'll be fine though.,70682,4
70684,I like this dress but I thought it would fit more fitted formed in me but it's fine it's still pretty.,70684,4
70684,I ordered it for work but it's kind of shirt so I didn't take a chance.,70684,4
70685,Nice but run a little small not to bad anyway,70685,4
70687,It fits pretty close to actual size.,70687,4
70687,If I ordered it again I would definitely order 1 size bigger.,70687,4
70689,"This is my first review, but I felt like I needed to share my experience!",70689,4
70689,I love these pants so much that I want one in every style and color!,70689,4
70689,My only disappointment is the length.,70689,4
70689,"Since my legs and abdomen are short I actually had to cut a couple inches off the bottom, but I didn't need to sew it because the material doesn't shred.",70689,4
70689,It was a nice clean cut.,70689,4
70689,"The seams were off slightly so the circles on my legs don't match up; someone must not have been paying attention to what they were doing the day they sewed these, but it's not that noticeable.",70689,4
70689,Those are my only concerns.,70689,4
70689,"Otherwise, they are SUPER comfortable and fit me in the waist very well.",70689,4
70690,A little loose from the top but was able to take it in.,70690,4
70690,Stretches a little so a little extra room for a perfect fit.,70690,4
70691,"Very good material, soft but firm, not flimsy.",70691,4
70691,"Ordered a size small and it fits perfectly around the waist, flows nicely.",70691,4
70691,"Only reason why I took off a star rating is because it IS a little bit, just a teeny (like, if standing in the sun) a bit see-through, so I've had to so far wear it with tights underneath, but other than that, find a way to make it work.",70691,4
70692,"I did like the fact that it is a color screen protector, just wish it could have a wet application.",70692,4
70692,That way it'll be really flawless and maybe come out with Red and carbon fiber  maybe.,70692,4
70692,( just my two cents ) :)  P.S.,70692,4
70692,"when I ordered this product, the shipping was very quick",70692,4
70693,"Really cute top, well made and designed.",70693,4
70693,Unfortunately the top was too small for me in the shoulders but I will re-order a larger size.,70693,4
70694,"nice shoe, i love it",70694,4
70695,"The color is lighter than shown, more of a dusty light blue.",70695,4
70695,Very soft and comfortable,70695,4
70696,"For cheap body jewelry, this is not bad.",70696,4
70696,Better than past experiences by far; the jewels a reset sturdily and it looks good.,70696,4
70696,"Metal finish is cheap however, and left a weird stain on my navel the first week.",70696,4
70697,Perfect canvas for embroidery.,70697,4
70698,I switched over to workout pants as it has been getting pretty cold of late.,70698,4
70698,These ADFOLF pants are very light and easy to work out in.,70698,4
70698,I am not a cargo pockets of the pants and think it's pretty ugly.,70698,4
70698,"This pants are have pretty short, but I like it as I usually wear basketball shoes that come up to the ankles.",70698,4
70699,"nice but cheap, still a good buy though",70699,4
70700,Just as I expected it to be.,70700,4
70700,The colors are good.,70700,4
70700,Just like the picture.,70700,4
70701,It's a little see through but I love the fit and length.,70701,4
70701,Overall a good buy.,70701,4
70702,The fit is good but I'm not crazy about the material.,70702,4
70702,"A little thin, I will have to see how it works after being washed.",70702,4
70702,I wanted a fitted sweater to wear with jackets and sweaters that did not add bulk and this works that way.,70702,4
70702,"So, we will see in the future if I rebuy.",70702,4
70704,Problem is gained a touch of weight.,70704,4
70704,Am sure this will become one of my favoritescwhen I fix that.,70704,4
70705,Love it but my zipper broke the first week I had it,70705,4
70706,"Was always switching items out of a typical trifold leather wallet into a ""hiking"" wallet.",70706,4
70706,When the trifold finally needed replaced; I thought I would give this Nylon Wallet a chance.,70706,4
70706,Switched back and forth for a few Day Hikes and then finally moved most of the contents over full time.,70706,4
70706,With smart phones holding pictures and doing so many more tasks than in the old days; I no longer need the options of a thick older wallet.,70706,4
70706,So much better with this minimal lightweight option.,70706,4
70706,I save time and weight by this becoming my everyday carry wallet.,70706,4
70706,"On top of that, I no longer have the butt bulge and my foot doesn't go to sleep when sitting or driving.",70706,4
70706,Glad I made this purchase.,70706,4
70706,"For Backpacking gram weinies this wallet is 36g - 1.25oz with DL, Insurance Card, and One Credit Debit Card.",70706,4
70709,I got these to replace my Dana Buchman purse straps.,70709,4
70709,"They are wider and shorter than the originals, but I was able to still get them to work.",70709,4
70709,"These are sold individually, so you must order two to have a pair.",70709,4
70710,The leggings came on time but they are slightly snug.,70710,4
70710,However I am still going to keep them because I think this may be an advantage to keeping them in place during my yoga practice.,70710,4
70711,I  love this dress.,70711,4
70713,I was looking for a pair of leggings/jeggings that looked like faded jeans.,70713,4
70713,"Aside from the print around the waistband that is supposed to appear as belt loops, pockets and a zipper, these look great!",70713,4
70713,"(I wear my shirts long over the tummy and behind, anyway, so it's not like anyone will know about the faux print.)",70713,4
70713,"They're lightly lined with soft material, so they're not see through at all, and the lining helps to keep the leggings from looking too clingy.",70713,4
70713,"They're not ""jeans"" like in material, but in appearance, though they are a tad on the shiny side, but that doesn't ruin the look of them at all.",70713,4
70713,"I ordered a small/medium, and as an American size 8/Med., they stretch to fit great without seeming too stretched, if you know what I mean.",70713,4
70713,"AND, they don't shift or slide or bag out of place, which is a plus!",70713,4
70713,"They're super soft, very comfortable.",70713,4
70713,I'm glad I ordered a pair!,70713,4
70714,This is not lined so I was not overly impressed.,70714,4
70714,They have great customer service though!,70714,4
70714,Even though the item didn't work out for me it was still reasonably priced for what it is.,70714,4
70714,you can line if for yourself if you don't mind doing a little extra :),70714,4
70715,"They are so cute , but they are kind of thick I just got my earlobes pierced like 2 months ago and I was looking for something like this so they were not bugging me at night when I sleep , but my piercing is smaller so couldn't wear them.",70715,4
70716,"Very thin material, pattern was the same.",70716,4
70716,As expected but the length was much shorter than in the pic.,70716,4
70718,This is a beautiful jacket you guys!!!,70718,4
70718,I am a medium and ordered a large.,70718,4
70718,However I received a medium and it fits.,70718,4
70718,A little tight on the shoulders but that won't bother me.,70718,4
70718,I am definitely buying more colors.,70718,4
70720,These are  beautiful statement piece of jewelry.,70720,4
70720,A bright bold color but heavy.,70720,4
70720,I'm not use to heavy and will only be able to wear them for brief periods of time.,70720,4
70720,Seller was very quick with delivery.,70720,4
70722,"Great material, comfortable and cuteee!!",70722,4
70722,"The only reason I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5 is because its very large, like I wanted it to be big so I did get a large when I wear a medium and it's alot bigger than I was expecting..",70722,4
70722,But I still love it!,70722,4
70723,nice coat fit true to size but the arms were tight on me,70723,4
70724,Great buy for the price.,70724,4
70724,I wear a 40DD and usually a size 16 or XL.,70724,4
70724,It is very light weight and airy.,70724,4
70724,I bought a 3XL because I was leery an XL would be too small and short.,70724,4
70724,"I was leaning towards a 2XL but then I kept telling myself that the last time I bought something that was like this, it was too short.",70724,4
70724,I like my shirts to be a little below my waistline but not below my hips.,70724,4
70724,"It's the perfect length and size, esp because I don't like to feel constrained.",70724,4
70724,"The material is stretchy so I probably could've gotten a 2XL and been fine, but I told myself I'd rather it be a tiny bit big than too small.",70724,4
70724,Bought it in 2 different colors and am glad I did.,70724,4
70725,My tall 8 year old (wears size 10 pants) likes the underwear.,70725,4
70725,It is snug but not tight.,70725,4
70725,Will buy again when he needs more pairs.,70725,4
70725,"Gave 4 stars since we just bought and I don't know whether they will last, shrink, etc.",70725,4
70726,the were nice quality.,70726,4
70727,It's hard to find a bathing suit to fit me as I'm pear shaped.,70727,4
70727,"I'm 5'2"" 110 lbs and ordered the Small.",70727,4
70727,I'm a 32A and hips are about 36-38in so the top was a little loose while the bottom fit alright.,70727,4
70727,You win some you lose some.,70727,4
70727,The material is also pretty stiff.,70727,4
70727,But the suit itself is cute.,70727,4
70728,The dress fits well but wrinkles easily!,70728,4
70728,"The material is very thin, which works out because I just hang it in the bathroom when I shower and most of the wrinkles come out.",70728,4
70728,My only real complaint is the very top of the dress.,70728,4
70728,The neckline has beads that fold inwards sometimes.,70728,4
70728,"Other than that, I love the dress!",70728,4
70729,i normally wear an XL in Columbia collared shirts (44 bust).,70729,4
70729,"a 3XL in this shirt was still 2 sizes too small ... seller, please add an 5XL to the selection, as the shirt is cute, material lightweight & soft  as other reviewers have stated, and I really need an olive shirt!",70729,4
70734,This is very cute but was a little smaller than expected...,70734,4
70735,I really like this romper...,70735,4
70735,"Although it doesn't look exactly like the picture it was still a good buy
I am 5'6 tall and weigh 146 pounds I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly",70735,4
70736,"Good product, fit well, a little stiff, as a new belt might be.",70736,4
70737,I like this product a lot,70737,4
70738,"Just as described, somewhat wrinkled on deliver, but looks fine after hanging.",70738,4
70739,I do love this pretty bathrobe-even though it is inappropriately sized!,70739,4
70739,It is a lovely quality of cotton and embroidery!,70739,4
70739,"However, yes, that tie opening on either side of the garment is ridiculously sized-almost ludicrous!",70739,4
70739,Just because I love the robe I'm going to reattach the ties at a suitable level!,70739,4
70740,"I have the sets for Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Unova, they are pretty good, some are the wrong colors namely a few in Sinnoh, but they ultimately look great, and are a great item for collectors of pokemon themed stuff",70740,4
70741,"Little cheap looking on the front 8 little turquoise balls, they're a tad plastic looking.",70741,4
70742,They are a little long from the waist to the legs,70742,4
70743,Not quite as bright neon green as I expected but still cute,70743,4
70744,"Per previous comments, these are not compression tanks.",70744,4
70744,I use them under my workout shirts,70744,4
70745,I got a larger size based on the reviews.,70745,4
70746,It was estimated a 5-6 week delivery but I received in 3 weeks.,70746,4
70746,"I'm 5 months pregnant, got to wear this once before the belly got too big, so I'd say this would fit about right if I didn't have my baby belly.",70746,4
70746,"Cute pattern, a little muted in expectation of colors.",70746,4
70746,My 4 start review is for the material quality; a hanger easily snagged a hole in the skirt.,70746,4
70746,"However, you get what you pay for, so all in all, I'd buy again.",70746,4
70747,"This shirt is very fancy,it is a head turner,I bought two deep blue,one for me one for my daughter, but maybe for a very fancy occasion",70747,4
70748,"Very soft and comfortable material and I like the length, it's not super short like some, I'm 5'10 and it sits below my waist.",70748,4
70748,"I'm 140 lbs and normally wear a size small or size 4-6 in almost all brands, I bought a small in this and it fits well, not too tight or loose.",70748,4
70748,The only thing I didn't like was that the arm holes are big and sit low so it shows your bra and the unpleasant armpit fat!,70748,4
70749,I love this product but the part of the bikini in my booty looks  like does not have rear but if you have fit perfect,70749,4
70750,"The straps were a little loose but I adjusted, wore it for New Years definitely a win",70750,4
70751,Fit was a bit smaller but just more motivation to shrink into it.,70751,4
70753,Looks and fits great.,70753,4
70753,I'm very happy with the quality and fit.,70753,4
70753,"I wear a 38DDD, so a 36E is a little snug, but the cup size is perfect.",70753,4
70754,Wear it to gym classes.just hoping it won't fade fast in the chorline.,70754,4
70755,Loved loved loved this dress and the fit.,70755,4
70755,My only issue is it started to cone apart at the seem ehile i was wearing it.,70755,4
70756,It's a little smaller than I would have expected for a 4XL but it is excellent quality and it was delivered quickly.,70756,4
70757,Good value for money.,70757,4
70757,I am a repeat customer.,70757,4
70758,"Nice, but a bit small I need to loose 3-4 pounds.",70758,4
70759,Needed the next size up but nice...,70759,4
70760,May need a few adjustments so it can fit,70760,4
70762,I found that these were good for low intensity exercise as opposed to very active exercise.,70762,4
70762,I use them primarily when lifting weights or even just as shoes around the house.,70762,4
70762,When I attempted to wear them during Kickboxing they did fly off my foot.,70762,4
70762,"The fit is very good, true to size.",70762,4
70762,"The elastic around the ankle and across the foot is comfortable, it does not constrict movement or create an uncomfortable pressure.",70762,4
70762,I've been wearing them for a few months and so far the construction of the shoe has held up well.,70762,4
70762,"The cushion is minimal and would be good for someone looking for a minimalist fit, the main fabric is breathable and light weight.",70762,4
70762,the bonus wrist wallet has been more helpful than I anticipated.,70762,4
70762,I use it frequently when I go for walks or just don't want to carry a purse.,70762,4
70762,The value is very good for the price of the product.,70762,4
70762,I would recommend this others.,70762,4
70763,I was impressed by the quality of these inexpensive shades.,70763,4
70763,These will be great for driving.,70763,4
70763,I love that my pair came with two soft cases.,70763,4
70764,It's very heavy and good material.,70764,4
70764,Longer than I need.,70764,4
70764,The thighs were tight.,70764,4
70764,It's OK to wear out in the snow or super cold weather but not lazing around on the sofa!,70764,4
70764,I'm keeping it for a snow day.,70764,4
70764,That may be several years from where I live.,70764,4
70764,"If I were going to get one to lounge around inside, I would get a large and had it hemmed.",70764,4
70764,The crotch is halfway to my knees and the back pocket is on my upper thigh.,70764,4
70764,Kind of funky looking.,70764,4
70765,These are cute sneakers but the lights didn't last longer than 2 weeks and there is no charger with them andI can't find one anywhere,70765,4
70766,"Super cute, but one of the silver clips came off.",70766,4
70766,I super glued it and it is ok now :p,70766,4
70767,This is one of my favorite hats.,70767,4
70767,It is really good for spring.,70767,4
70767,It has a certain stylish pop to the upturned brim that I like and have received a few compliments when wearing it.,70767,4
70767,"Might be a little too well made for a summer time hat, but I'm keeping it in my rotation for spring, fall and a little into winter for sure.",70767,4
70767,"It fits a little snug, but that is to be expected for the quality you get in this hat.",70767,4
70767,I'm keeping my eye on this brand.,70767,4
70768,"Super comfy, but the white is SEE THROUGH!!!!",70768,4
70768,"I wear these under long shirts/dresses so it works, but not exactly what I wanted",70768,4
70769,A really light weight and roomy purse.,70769,4
70769,I really liked my purse.,70769,4
70770,"Nice bathing suit, fit just right, but the clasp to hold the top up broke right when I put it on, but it's an easy fix that can be sewn.",70770,4
70771,Small is equivalent to an extra small.,70771,4
70771,"Otherwise they are awesome, lightweight, great for layering, very moisture wicking",70771,4
70772,Reccomend ordering a size up.,70772,4
70774,It feels real nice.,70774,4
70774,It came in like in 3 weeks.,70774,4
70774,"But for some reason mien says yatear, not yateer.",70774,4
70775,Dress fit to  small for me  Should fit someone who is a small.,70775,4
70775,It is a very pretty dress.,70775,4
70775,I gave to my niece.,70775,4
70776,I am 100lbs and a 32D.,70776,4
70776,I normally get xs bottoms and a small top (sometimes a medium depending on the cut/brand).,70776,4
70776,I decided to order a medium to make sure the top fit correctly.,70776,4
70776,I love how the top fits!,70776,4
70776,"The bottoms are definitely a little big on me but that was expected, however if you normally get a medium in bottoms or don't like cheeky bottoms I definitely recommend sizing up.",70776,4
70776,The colors are great and the bikini seems well made.,70776,4
70777,"I have to confess that I bought this for myself, not my daughter.",70777,4
70777,I have a skin condition and am having trouble finding all cotton bras that have any shape.,70777,4
70777,I am small framed and thought I would take a chance on this.,70777,4
70777,It did not work out for me.,70777,4
70777,The size I ordered was too small and the bra was not as comfortable as I would like so I probably will not order up.,70777,4
70777,"I also am not certain even a larger size would give me enough cup coverage, plus I really wanted white (I react to clothing dyes) - so not the bra for me.",70777,4
70777,But I do have to say that this bra runs somewhat larger than the Hanes and Maidenform teen bras of the same size - and the cotton sure feels a lot nicer than those plastic-like fabrics most teen bras are made of.,70777,4
70777,I wish I could have found these bras when my teen daughter was younger.,70777,4
70777,It is cute and offers good support for the size.,70777,4
70777,It also has a good amount of padding so it is modest and fills the cups a bit but isn't overly padded like the push-up bras.,70777,4
70777,"(About 1/4 to 1/2 inch padding,  so if your daughter is a young preteen you might find it adds too much shape.)",70777,4
70777,Some comments:  A previous poster suggested that size 36 = adult 36 B but I would suggest it is more like an adult  34 B.,70777,4
70777,The bra is almost exactly the same size as the old 34 B's I still have in my drawer from my skinnier days.,70777,4
70777,The cotton is fairly soft but the lace is scratchy.,70777,4
70777,"I don't think it sits against the skin,but I wish they had used cotton lace.",70777,4
70777,"The bra straps are bit sharp - kind of ""knife-edge.""",70777,4
70777,"Again, I wish they had used better quality straps; personally I would be willing to pay up for better quality all around.",70777,4
70777,"But for many teens this might not be an issue,  Finally, the bra I got had a slight discoloration on the strap like maybe the bra had been sitting around in a warehouse for a while.",70777,4
70778,I used this for my 2 week trip to Europe and it totally came in handy.,70778,4
70778,It made it so much easier to organize my stuff.,70778,4
70778,I give it a four star instead of 5 because the mesh did start ripping at some point but I would definitely buy this again and I would recommend it to anyone.,70778,4
70779,This is a beautiful piece of daith jewelry.,70779,4
70779,This is my first piece for my daith piercing but the only thing I'm not happy with is the gauge.,70779,4
70779,It's a 16 and I wasn't sure what gauge I should have gotten.,70779,4
70779,So I guess I need a smaller gauge next time.,70779,4
70780,Not what I expected !,70780,4
70781,I was disappointed when these arrived because they are not the size quoted on the Amazon website.,70781,4
70781,But I will make them do.,70781,4
70781,"They are fine otherwise, just not the sizes I planned on.",70781,4
70782,"As others have mentioned, the scoop neck is low.",70782,4
70782,I have to wear a black bra or black tank underneath to compensate.,70782,4
70783,This arrived super fast and was as describd.,70783,4
70784,They're great for when you're starting out.,70784,4
70784,These are pretty durable and look really nice.,70784,4
70786,"I really like the bathing suit, however, I measured vs the size chart, need to go up 2 sizes based on chart.",70786,4
70786,"However, arrived quickly and they are exchanging quickly
1",70786,4
70787,Bought this clutch for a black tie wedding.,70787,4
70787,It matched my dress beautifully.,70787,4
70787,"Only downside, it's heavier than it looks.",70787,4
70788,Great for a birthday gift.,70788,4
70789,"Fit perfectly, held its shape most of the night for the most part, but it could have used a little hairspray to keep some pieces up.",70789,4
70790,"I would give it 5 stars, but it's slightly small.",70790,4
70790,I recommend ordering a size up if you are endowed with a buttock and thighs.,70790,4
70790,"The material is real denim, but not stretchy and it's more of an acid wash color.",70790,4
70790,I'll probably give the first one away and order a size up considering the cost of shipping may not be worth returning.,70790,4
70790,It was a bonus that it didn't take long to arrive!,70790,4
70790,Update: I ordered the XL and it still didn't fit.,70790,4
70790,"Off you're curvy or have a small top and but bottom,  this is not for you unless they increase their size to XXL because these aren't regular American sizes.",70790,4
70790,"I'm a true size 8, 5'7"".",70790,4
70791,It was in a few pieces when I opened it.,70791,4
70791,But all the parts were there and I'm wearing it right now.,70791,4
70791,Heavy necklaces have been bothering me and this one is so light I can hardly feel I have it on.,70791,4
70793,But it's a little tight.,70793,4
70793,When you open it up middle pops out and it doesn't lay flat.,70793,4
70793,Hopefully with more wear it will be better.,70793,4
70794,"The buckle was a little tricky to get it to stay on, but shipping was fast and overall quality is good.",70794,4
70795,Fit as expected...just a little shorter than I wanted it.,70795,4
70796,"I ordered Large size,but I have Medium.",70796,4
70796,I read reviews and thought that I had to buy a bigger size.,70796,4
70796,(But it's too big.,70796,4
70796,"(Anyway,  it's  a very pretty dress.",70796,4
70797,Love the grips are the bottom.,70797,4
70797,Perfect for little feet,70797,4
70798,Well made and good for not too cold days.,70798,4
70798,"Just got snug in my chest, but fine everywhere else.",70798,4
70799,"Its a tad bit small when you dry it and it has a few stray fabrics,but once you get them off its a really nice looking flannel but not that flannel material",70799,4
70800,this shirt is so soft and cute.,70800,4
70800,I wore it as soon as I got it.,70800,4
70800,favorite part o f the shirt I the pocket that's kind of off to the side and crooked and on the sleeves there are little holes so you can put your thumbs in it so your sleeves keep your hands warm.,70800,4
70800,I would recommend it to everyone.,70800,4
70801,I purchased the shirt thinking a men's XXL would fit me (I wear a women's 3x).,70801,4
70801,"Shirt wouldn't button across my chest, so I gave it to my husband.",70801,4
70802,The blouse is lovely.,70802,4
70802,Fits a bit small but material and and sewn beautifully!,70802,4
70804,Get your size because if you get it a lil too small the colors on the dress stretch and makes it look as if it fades,70804,4
70805,"Fits well and looks exactly as pictured, the only issue i had was that the material was a little itchy.",70805,4
70805,But i have very sensitive skin.,70805,4
70806,I have been wearing it for two week and it still looks great.,70806,4
70806,I ordered two more.,70806,4
70806,It takes along time to get them.,70806,4
70807,Way too smell otherwise sexy,70807,4
70808,It fitted perfectly and the price was great!,70808,4
70810,"This blouse has a heavy, elegant feel to it.",70810,4
70810,"The two layers really work for my figure and sooo softish comfortable, inner layer snuggy, stretchy, form  fitting to below hip, outer layer is flyaway, back is split into two long pieces like a tuxedo.",70810,4
70810,"Long sleeves are very long, snug.",70810,4
70810,Great buy for a dressy top.,70810,4
70811,The mermaid tail is the only reason we purchased this and I'm so glad we did.,70811,4
70811,My 4 year old loves this tail and wants to wear it every time she goes swimming.,70811,4
70811,It is very long on her but I purchased a matching one piece swim suit to go along with it and she wears it over her swim suit with the top tucked under the bow on chest of the swim suit.,70811,4
70811,"Wearing it up high is the only way she can walk in it,  but she just turned 4 so I expected it to be big on her.",70811,4
70811,"She has worn this many many times, it is a thin material but the color or design has not faded and it is still in perfect condition.",70811,4
70811,"We did use the top and the tail to have her pictures taken in for her birthday invitations and they looked great,  but the top is definitely not something I would let her swim in.",70811,4
70811,"But overall, just the tail alone was totally worth it.",70811,4
70812,A cute piece to pair with jeans or a skirt.,70812,4
70813,"My daughter purchased this and this is her review :
I'm 5'7, 195 lbs, with a 36D bra size and the Large fit.",70813,4
70813,I need to do more ab work for it to look amazing on but my boyfriend loves it.,70813,4
70813,The top wrapped around enough to cover everything but when I raised my arms it slipped off; I think this will be fixed if I tie it tighter which may be hard because there was not much material left over.,70813,4
70813,What I love most is I will be able to do different things with the top.,70813,4
70814,Really cute w/straight pants and flats,70814,4
70815,My daughter liked them and shared with her friends,70815,4
70816,"Very shiny, has good weight to it.",70816,4
70816,Comes in a gift bag.,70816,4
70816,"I ended up returning it because I ordered a size too large, plus I decided I wanted something a little more delicate.",70816,4
70816,This ring is pretty substantial; would make a nice wedding band.,70816,4
70818,"Beautiful dress, a little small.",70818,4
70818,Some of the pearls and jewels have fallen off and I've only tried it on twice.,70818,4
70818,"Pieces are a little loose, may need to secure better, but beautifully made.",70818,4
70819,Some of these are diff sizes they fit depends on the place you buy it from.,70819,4
70819,Some are very cheap.,70819,4
70819,The ones that takes a month to reach you will be very very small.,70819,4
70819,This one fits ok.,70819,4
70819,I always get the XL.,70819,4
70819,"So just know depending on who you buy it from, the size are all different.",70819,4
70820,"Purchased an extra large, usually wear medium-large.",70820,4
70821,Size is just right.,70821,4
70822,"It is ok but I thought it would be a little bigger, but my granddaughter love it..Good color and I liked the way its made..",70822,4
70823,Very beautiful and high quality.,70823,4
70823,I have owned several corsets just for fun but this corset was definitely designed for waist training.,70823,4
70823,"Easy to take on and off, and really synched my waist.",70823,4
70823,The lining of the corset is a dark blue leopard print that added some fun flare.,70823,4
70823,The reason I am not giving 5 stars is that I am petite and the corset was a bit long for my torso,70823,4
70824,This shirt is nice but took a while to find the right size.,70824,4
70824,I normally wear a medium in most brands and had to order a small in this.,70824,4
70824,The medium would have been okay if I wanted it baggy but I wanted it to fit a little more like a normal shirt.,70824,4
70824,A small is still like a blouse without being baggy.,70824,4
70824,The material seems nice and flows well.,70824,4
70824,The front and back are long enough that I can wear it with leggings.,70824,4
70824,Might be too long to wear just with a pair of dress pants to work.,70824,4
70826,Nice quality for the price.,70826,4
70826,We'll see how it holds up.,70826,4
70827,"Great dress, really beautiful!",70827,4
70827,"I have large boobs and it had a hard time holding them up, so I need to add some halter straps to hold them up a bit better.",70827,4
70827,"Otherwise it fit perfectly as per the measurements listed, and looked great at my event!",70827,4
70828,The top is a little smaller than I thought but it's really soft and comfy.,70828,4
70828,It's a little bit see through though.,70828,4
70829,These are true workout pants.,70829,4
70829,They are a comfortable material and a bit more sturdy than what most active wear seems to be made of nowadays.,70829,4
70829,"The waist band has plenty of stretch but the other material does not have as much give or stretch as most typical active wear but it does seem to provide a bit more support so you don't feel as ""jiggly"" when working out.",70829,4
70829,"Also, the material is thick enough that you don't have to worry about it being see through.",70829,4
70830,Bought this to go with my Halloween costume - had them on time and they fit just fine.,70830,4
70830,I was concerned about them being One Size but they were comfortable and fit well.,70830,4
70830,"I am 5'1"", 125lbs.",70830,4
70831,"I want to give these pants 5 stars, but I have to go with 4.",70831,4
70831,I LOVE the way these fit.,70831,4
70831,"For a woman my size (i'm 5'3, 245lbs, size 18) the XL is a little smaller than I would have hoped.",70831,4
70831,"They fit, but they are snug.",70831,4
70831,Which is great for working out.,70831,4
70831,I usually get pants with no drawstring and they fall down constantly.,70831,4
70831,These stayed up throughout my whole workout.,70831,4
70831,"When stretched out, they are NOT see through.",70831,4
70831,"They are fairly thick, so you cannot see through them.",70831,4
70831,I know this is important for a lot of people.,70831,4
70831,"Anyway, I would buy them and if you're on the fence, I would definitely order them.",70831,4
70831,They are worth the money.,70831,4
70832,Cute socks and I love them for my am Crossfit workouts!,70832,4
70834,Extremely all out comfort.,70834,4
70834,No riding up leg or having to pull from the famous wedgey.,70834,4
70834,Great product but a bit pricy for underwear.,70834,4
70835,These are very pretty.,70835,4
70835,There a little large for me but not a big issue.,70835,4
70835,Reason for four stars is the seam on one glove had to be sewn.,70835,4
70835,It was this way out of package.,70835,4
70835,Not a big deal but you prefer not to be making repairs.,70835,4
70836,"I got this for my girlfriend after we tried searching for the Muxilove seller (to no avail, they must have been removed) She's about 5' 0"" and 140 lbs, and a 36b/34c.",70836,4
70836,We got a medium and it was a bit too small.,70836,4
70836,We'll be returning for a large or extra large.,70836,4
70836,Quality: the stitching seems good and the fabric (neoprene) is great.,70836,4
70836,There isn't any type of padding or pushup in it but there is an underwire.,70836,4
70836,There is flap that allows you to put your own pushup inserts in it but it did not have any in to begin with.,70836,4
70837,I love the color and fit.,70837,4
70837,The length is perfect and it looks good on jeans,70837,4
70838,A gift for someone who loved it.,70838,4
70839,"I would like this a lot more if the lining was the same color as the exterior of the stand, as the 'fur' fake color almost looks dirty... but the case works great and I like that I can store my eyeglasses on my small nightstand without a case taking up a lot of space...",70839,4
70840,"Love the shirt, but glad I read the reviews and ordered a size up.",70840,4
70840,It definitely runs small.,70840,4
70841,It turned my wrist dark where it rubbed.,70841,4
70841,I uses clear polish to stop it.,70841,4
70841,Polish stopped the turning dark.pretty bracelet.,70841,4
70841,Wanted sterling or stainless steel.,70841,4
70842,"But I got to thinking, how do I clean it with the leather on it?",70842,4
70843,This piece is nice.,70843,4
70843,However I changed the choker for a chain.,70843,4
70843,I used a chain from one of my other pieces from this seller and switched as I don't really like chokers.,70843,4
70843,I didn't realize when I purchased it but problem solved ..it is a very nice piece.,70843,4
70844,it fits verry well and is cayute,70844,4
70845,Pretty colors and fits well.,70845,4
70845,I ordered an XL for a M.,70845,4
70846,Love this belly ring although it will rust pretty easily if you shower with it on.,70846,4
70847,"Good quality outfit, but does run slightly larger",70847,4
70848,"Tight clips, but a bit thin for material thickness and very lightweight.",70848,4
70848,I assume they will scratch and tarnish in short time... however for the price there are no complaints.,70848,4
70849,nice good for the price,70849,4
70850,Great fit and color quality will order another in red or grey.,70850,4
70850,Fantastic addition to my wardrobe .,70850,4
70850,With Micro suede T shirt.,70850,4
70850,Very comfortable  looks great together.,70850,4
70851,Worked well for the intended use.,70851,4
70851,Would have been a nice addition.,70851,4
70854,"I was scared of the sizing, even though I ordered a size up, but it all fit okay.",70854,4
70854,"The only reason I gave this 4 stars out of 5 is because the breast pads shift around, and I get the feeling that it isn't restricted to when I'm on land.",70854,4
70854,"Other than that, great product.",70854,4
70855,It's cute and fun but the fabric is very thin which is ok it's sleepwear.,70855,4
70856,"Nice lightweight shoe, stylish, maybe runs a bit small.",70856,4
70856,Is a bear to get on my foot.,70856,4
70856,The material that goes around the heel is cloth like and bends and collapses when I put my foot in.,70856,4
70856,"The tongue is kinda sewn in place, so you only have some much room to work with.",70856,4
70856,Once I got them on they were great.,70856,4
70856,"I wore them with some seersucker pants, thought it looked great together.",70856,4
70857,"Very nice box, although smaller than expected.",70857,4
70857,The necklace was surprisingly nice for the price.,70857,4
70857,The chain is small so it's a close fit for an adult.,70857,4
70857,This was purchased for a 9-year-old Titanic fan and she was beyond pleased.,70857,4
70857,A very good product for the price.,70857,4
70859,"I am 5'0, 160lbs (thicker build) I ordered a large after reading some other reviews and the fit was perfect!",70859,4
70859,Because I am shorter I had some excess material near the bottom but it isn't anything too major that I can't live with.,70859,4
70859,The top is a little snug but nothing too uncomfortable either.,70859,4
70859,I definitely can't wait to wear this out.,70859,4
70860,"If you like Roomy shirts, this is the one for you.",70860,4
70860,"Shirt runs big, purchase a smaller size than you wear.",70860,4
70861,"Somewhat small, but not bad",70861,4
70863,The material and fit is exactly how you'd expect it to be.,70863,4
70863,It was light and comfortable.,70863,4
70863,"I haven't washed it yet, but I'm sure it won't change too much.",70863,4
70864,The fabric on top is a bit thin and the neckline is very low that it shows your cleavage.,70864,4
70864,Other than that it's a pretty dress.,70864,4
70865,It was as described,70865,4
70866,"It definitely runs large, but honestly it didn't bother me too much.",70866,4
70866,"I wish I would have ordered a size down, but because I am so tall I wanted it to be a little longer.",70866,4
70866,It works perfectly for a 20s themed party.,70866,4
70866,"Nothing too fancy, but still a solid costume piece!",70866,4
70867,"very nice just short, I expected it to be longer.",70867,4
70868,"I always wanted a waist shaped, but to be honest it has been over a month since I purchased it & I have only  worn it twice.",70868,4
70868,"I have long nails, so clipping all those 100 clips makes it a challenge of its own.",70868,4
70868,Before purchasing really think if you have 15-20 available in the morning before headed to work.,70868,4
70868,"If you do than this will work for you, I rather sleep.",70868,4
70869,I do think it was a little shorter than expected.,70869,4
70869,"I think I was also suppose to get a necklace with this shirt as well, but it may have been from a different seller.",70869,4
70871,I thought these were a little large when they arrived.,70871,4
70871,"I saw the CTW listed, but I thought it was for both earrings.",70871,4
70871,It is for each earring.,70871,4
70871,"My wife loved them, so we kept them.",70871,4
70872,"I normally wear a large, but I ordered a XL because of the previous comments about running small.",70872,4
70872,I'm glad I did.,70872,4
70872,It's so comfortable and perfect material for the extremely hot summer days.,70872,4
70873,"NOT what is pictured, slightly different (only silver beading) but still got a few compliments on it.",70873,4
70873,"Difficult to get on, seeing as it is a lace up.",70873,4
70874,"smaller than I thought but great looking pants, I could still make them work",70874,4
70875,"This is super cute, but the straps in back are not adjustable and cause the top too sit high on the chest.",70875,4
70875,We are hoping they stretch out over time.,70875,4
70877,The neck it pretty the quality isn't all that but like I said the necklace is pretty and a little long than I hope to be but it will do!,70877,4
70878,I am very satisfied with this shirt for the price.,70878,4
70878,Have had many compliments on it.,70878,4
70878,It is fading quickly though.,70878,4
70878,But it is well worth the price.,70878,4
70879,Great summer church hat.,70879,4
70880,The style of this in person looks different than the photo as the lace and the lining are different colors and it looks like they are the same color in the photo but I am still pleased with it.,70880,4
70882,soft comfortable i like the tag less.,70882,4
70882,so far they hold there shape around the neck next time I order some more I will get a size smaller i like the neck part to fit snug so I don't feel my own chin stubble's.,70882,4
70883,Somewhat tight getting into my usual size but feel ok once they're on.,70883,4
70884,Nice earrings but were too heavy and large for the person they were intended for.,70884,4
70884,I ended up returning them.,70884,4
70885,It looks very nice.,70885,4
70885,It is big enough to be an eye catcher but it is not too big.,70885,4
70885,The chain is a bit long and the clasp on the chain gets stuck.,70885,4
70885,I do like the look of the chain.,70885,4
70885,I will find another necklace for the eye.,70885,4
70885,It was well worth the few dollars I paid for it.,70885,4
70885,"Oh, and it shipped super fast.",70885,4
70885,It arrived way before the expected delivery  date.,70885,4
70886,"Didn't expect the hood to be a bit small, but it's more to be worn with it down than up.",70886,4
70886,"The button's hole wasn't large enough, so the button came off after many attempts to button it (my mistake).",70886,4
70886,The overall length is great.,70886,4
70886,"The cloak itself is long enough to go down to my calves, and the color is good.",70886,4
70886,No problems other than that.,70886,4
70887,I really love the shoes,70887,4
70888,Extremely large for a 4x.,70888,4
70888,It was more like a 5x+.,70888,4
70889,"Cute, but it fits tight around the arms and my arms are little.",70889,4
70892,These shoe socks are absolutely adorable!!!,70892,4
70892,I used to buy baby shoes but my baby outgrew the shoes before I could use it more than a dozen times.,70892,4
70892,She has used this set for several months and I bought them when she was around 5 months.,70892,4
70892,"They fit perfect then and they still fit perfect now, several months later.",70892,4
70892,"They don't kick off easy, either.",70892,4
70892,They wash really well.,70892,4
70892,The color has not faded nor has the bow warped.,70892,4
70892,You get a few little lint balls every now and then but that stopped when i started washing them inside out.,70892,4
70892,I recommend these for baby shower gifts due to the amount of attention they receive!,70892,4
70892,Parents often stop me and say how clever the socks are and how they wish they knew about them when their child was a baby.,70892,4
70892,The color assortment is ok.,70892,4
70892,I took of one star because I was missing one of the colors.,70892,4
70892,I notified amazon and they corrected that issue.,70892,4
70893,It was just way to big on my daughter.,70893,4
70893,So I sent it back and ordered a smaller size.,70893,4
70893,My daughter is going to look absolutely beautiful in it for my wedding,70893,4
70895,Great product for the price,70895,4
70896,It goes with any blazer and fits almost every occasion,70896,4
70897,"I ordered an XL and it feels like a L. So, be aware of that.",70897,4
70897,"And be ready to pack a whole lotta cleavage if you've got substantial ""boobage"" going on.",70897,4
70897,"It's tight in the upper arms, like if you want to reach for something you will feel it holding you back.",70897,4
70897,Not sure why there are straps in the back?,70897,4
70897,"Other than that, I like it.",70897,4
70898,Nice garment for the price.,70898,4
70899,I had read reviews that the pants ran small so I ordered a size up.,70899,4
70899,"The elastic waistband fit well around my natural waist, but these look like they are supposed to fit around your hips.",70899,4
70899,It was really easy to remove the elastic band (it is only anchored in 1 spot).,70899,4
70899,The fabric is stretchy enough that once I removed the waistband they fit perfectly around my waist.,70899,4
70899,The cuff at the ankle doesn't show much (I'm short though) I almost wish I would have ordered the correct size (I ordered up because so many people said they ran small) and then removed the elastic.,70899,4
70899,Then maybe they would have fit better in length.,70899,4
70900,I bought these glasses to use with a Holtzmann Ghostbusters costume.,70900,4
70900,"When I received them, they were packaged very nicely and the case they came in was pretty sturdy.",70900,4
70900,I also love that they came with a cleaning cloth.,70900,4
70900,The glasses themselves were a little bigger than I was expecting.,70900,4
70900,The lenses were quite a bit darker than I was expecting as well.,70900,4
70900,More of a darker gold color but yellow when they are reflecting a lot of light.,70900,4
70900,They worked for what I needed them for in a rush but would probably look for something different if I wanted a more authentic Holtzmann look in the future.,70900,4
70901,"I thought it would be a loosing fitting top, but it's actually a form fitting stretchy tank.",70901,4
70901,"Still cute, just not what i expected",70901,4
70902,I was excited to get this robe.,70902,4
70902,"However, the hips are cut wrong.",70902,4
70902,"There is ample room everywhere but the hip area and when the robe was closed, it puckered and didn't fit right at all.",70902,4
70902,Have returned and am awaiting a refund.,70902,4
70903,Fits just fine keep in mind it's just a piece of layered clothing not wearing it to a fashion show,70903,4
70904,My daughter recently started working at Cracker Barrel and needed an oxford shirt with the button down collar.,70904,4
70904,This shirt works well for that.,70904,4
70904,"It is a little shorter than she would've liked, but it stays tucked in, so it's fine.",70904,4
70905,"I am 5'4"" 135 lbs 36-31-40 and it fits fine",70905,4
70906,My favorite boots ever.,70906,4
70906,Wore them all the time.,70906,4
70907,Beautiful dress just did not fit.,70907,4
70907,Has no packing slip for me to return .,70907,4
70907,Please send me something so i can return,70907,4
70910,Looks great and the fabric falls nicely.,70910,4
70911,"Very nice, but just too large for a newborn.",70911,4
70912,Size was larger than what I expected,70912,4
70913,Just like the picture shiny and metallic.,70913,4
70913,"Im 5'9"" and a size 7/8...medium fit fine.",70913,4
70914,One of the best shirt stays on the market for the price.,70914,4
70914,Just wish the clips were a bit stronger that's why I'm not giving it 5 stars.,70914,4
70915,Unfortunately I received a dress with a broken zipper.,70915,4
70915,However when I contacted customer service I was able to return it for a full refund.,70915,4
70915,The dress fits perfect and it looks great.,70915,4
70915,The only issue is the dress is incredibly thin and see through.,70915,4
70915,I ordered the white dress to wear to my wedding and will have to purchase a slip to go under for fear of everyone seeing my underwear.,70915,4
70915,Received a new dress.,70915,4
70915,The 4 stars is due to the fact that the dress is very see through,70915,4
70916,Very good looking pair of flip flops.,70916,4
70916,I wear them for long periods of time and they are really comfortable.,70916,4
70916,"They are a bit stiff at first, but after the first couple of times they were easy to break in.",70916,4
70917,Used for stretching out the toe box of leather wildland fire boots.,70917,4
70918,"This works like a T-shirt should: not too large, too small.",70918,4
70918,"It's comfortable, decorative, ...",70918,4
70919,Love the feel of these.,70919,4
70919,Will need them hemmed though.,70919,4
70920,"Not beautiful, but I didn't expect it to be.",70920,4
70920,Great price for a very serviceable item.,70920,4
70921,"It's getting 4 stars because in the picture the red looks darker, but it's a bright red.",70921,4
70921,It fits perfectly and I love how it's longer and it's soft.,70921,4
70921,It's a little thinner than I thought I was going to be.,70921,4
70922,The glasses are good quality and delivered with a great protective boxes.,70922,4
70922,"The glasses are larger than expected to fit the face of a little girl, it is more suited for a young teenager.",70922,4
70923,Looks and feels good but is flimsier than the case I was trying to replace.,70923,4
70925,Very cute dress for a nice price,70925,4
70926,"Happy with product, service, and experience.",70926,4
70927,"Love the dress, but the pull tie is tight.",70927,4
70927,I returned the first one for a larger size and never received a refund.,70927,4
70927,So be careful with returns.,70927,4
70928,Havaianas flip flops are the best.,70928,4
70928,I love wearing them because they are so comfortable.,70928,4
70928,"I keep a pair with me at all times, in my car, in my tote bags, everywhere.",70928,4
70928,"After a weary day at work, I gladly slide into them for an aahhh moment!!",70928,4
70928,"I said yes to the good arch support which flip flops really don't have, but these feel so good, I don't even worry about that.",70928,4
70928,"I do wish the cost was a little more affordable, but  I'M worth it (lol)!",70928,4
70929,Wear these pretty often.,70929,4
70929,The picture made it seem longer.,70929,4
70929,"I'm honestly not that tall (5'3 ish) and I have an average to slim build, but it hits me just above my knees.",70929,4
70929,"They still look great tho, like 'em.",70929,4
70930,Runs a little small but I received many compliments on it.,70930,4
70930,This will be my go-to shirt around Halloween!,70930,4
70931,Very nice but not as warm as I hoped for.,70931,4
70933,We really like this!,70933,4
70933,Kids loved trying it on.,70933,4
70933,Can't wait for Halloween!,70933,4
70934,it is smaller than I expected even though I ordered bigger one.,70934,4
70935,"This bodysuit is really cute, but the bottom half of the open back hangs in a strange way, perhaps because I ordered a size that was too large.",70935,4
70935,"Also, there is no quick way of using the restroom.",70935,4
70935,A snap bottom would have been better.,70935,4
70936,The shirt it great but just a bit to big if you know what I'm trying to come across here.,70936,4
70937,I wear a size 14 so ordered the XXXL.,70937,4
70937,So go much larger to be sure you get a good fit.,70937,4
70938,Love this necklace but the thiird chain broke off afterm only one wear.,70938,4
70938,I can still wear it with the 2 chains,70938,4
70939,"It is nice, as I expected that it would be.",70939,4
70939,"I was just disappointed that it runs small, as I am large chested.",70939,4
70940,"Had a funny smell,but I washed it and it turned out fine.",70940,4

70942,Runs bit to large for my gf wrist but still happy with it,70942,4
70943,"Everybody love those leggings, and I love it too!!!!",70943,4
70944,not very well made though.,70944,4
70944,the seams were broken in the back where the zipper is at.,70944,4
70944,I had to sew it together.,70944,4
70945,Very roomy and will made.,70945,4
70946,On small side but material and design are nice.,70946,4
70947,"Love the jeans, does fit too tight or too big, just right on me.",70947,4
70947,"Gd quality, I'll buy from these guys again.",70947,4
70948,"I still love the dress...I am giving this to my sister in hopes that when I lose more weight, I can ""borrow"" it from her!",70948,4
70949,Nice looking shirt I bought for the hubby.,70949,4
70949,I ordered big because all the reviews said they came small.,70949,4
70949,I think I may have over estimated.,70949,4
70950,"Good product, serves well.",70950,4
70951,I like it I think it could be just alittle bit wider but other then that it works great.,70951,4
70952,"These look great, but ran really small through the torso.",70952,4
70952,My kiddo barely got any wear out of them.,70952,4
70952,"They did wash up well, but I felt like they were sized small.",70952,4
70953,"When I first opened the package, I was a little worried.",70953,4
70953,It looks like something you would find in the children's department.,70953,4
70953,"But when it's on, it looks more grown up.",70953,4
70954,I would have given 5 stars if the blouse did not have fray ends at the top.,70954,4
70954,"Otherwise, love the top.",70954,4
70955,"The product is totally cute, but I made the mistake of not looking at the sizing chart.",70955,4
70955,"Keep in mind, the sizes aren't American sizes.",70955,4
70955,"I was going to return the dress, and the company was kind enough to accept the return request, but I decided to just hold onto it.",70955,4
70955,It didn't cost much and it was my fault for not reading the full description.,70955,4
70956,Good quality shirts the sizing wasn't right.,70956,4
70956,That happens a lot with different manufacturers.,70956,4
70956,Over all great I just sent them back.,70956,4
70956,Reccoment ordering one size smaller than you'd normally wear if you are fit and like shirts that look good on you and not baggy.,70956,4
70957,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price.,70957,4
70957,I got this to wear as a beach cover up or something to wear over a romper/dress during the summer.,70957,4
70957,"It is very cute, comfortable, and lightweight.",70957,4
70958,wish i was made of tougher metals though.,70958,4
70958,I have switched from my back pocket to front pocket wile carrying it do to it taking some damage from my arse.,70958,4
70959,"Shipping took so long I forgot I ordered it, also, I was unable to track it.",70959,4
70959,I remembered i ordered it when I received a phone call from a stranger saying that they delivered my package to the wrong address.,70959,4
70959,luckily this woman was nice enough to call the number on the package to return it to me :).,70959,4
70959,"Any who, necklace is pretty and is EXACTLY like the picture.",70959,4
70960,This corset is Great.,70960,4

70960,"I wear a 40 DD bra and while I did have to loosen the strings in the back, it still fit great.",70960,4
70960,The zipper in the front makes things so much easier.,70960,4
70960,I was able to loosen the straps in the back and then retie it & then I just had to zip it up in the front to put it on.,70960,4
70960,Makes putting it on by yourself very easy.,70960,4
70960,Most corsets require at least two people and this one did not.,70960,4
70960,"This corset is very flattering, it made my stomach and love handles appear smaller & took away the usual rolls & lumps that you would see through a dress normally.",70960,4
70960,It came with a matching G string and I felt very beautiful in it.,70960,4
70960,"It is definitely sexy enough to use as wedding night lingerie, so you don't have to spend extra money on that.",70960,4
70960,The price is also Perfect.,70960,4
70960,"David's bridal charges $70 & up for their corsets, and they are no where near as pretty or as comfortable as this one.",70960,4
70960,"I do wish the zipper went all the way to the top, I could use the extra support, but overall this corset is perfect.",70960,4
70961,Pretty darn good for the money .. cant go wrong for the money.. description was accurate.. thank goodness,70961,4
70962,They came with alot of extra strings that i had to snip off and one of the straps looks like it was poorly stitched.,70962,4
70962,All in all they are comfy and cute.,70962,4
70963,I own three different versions of this.,70963,4
70963,If you plan on wearing one every day I recommend buying at least three because they do smell from sweat by the end of the day.,70963,4
70964,"Beautiful crystal, bought for my wife.",70964,4
70965,"Good quality 20g Surgical Steel, Cubic Zirconia Nose Screw.",70965,4
70965,"I have also, like others reported found that they shaft is a bit long for me but like many others I just bend the screw toward the head to get a tighter fit.",70965,4
70965,"The clear, crystal stone sparkles and sets well in the setting as well as laying slightly protruded from the hole in my nose.",70965,4
70966,"Can't complain for $10, but when it arrived in the mail, the material was coming unstitched from the zipper.",70966,4
70966,"Like I said, I paid $10 so I wasn't too upset.",70966,4
70966,I took it to an alterations shop and they fixed it for $8.,70966,4
70966,"Material does have some stretch to it, and is light weight.",70966,4
70967,very pretty - the color is beautiful.,70967,4
70967,I will be using this as a swim suit cover up.,70967,4
70968,It helps on my morning walks when hitting the sun spots.,70968,4
70969,I love these beanies and they look really good the only reason I took a star away was cause they don't cover the bottom of my ears.,70969,4
70969,"It could be because I have thick hair but it still annoys me but other than that I love them and they're very warm, would recommend.",70969,4
70971,looks great fits great.,70971,4
70971,its a lighter jacket than expected.,70971,4
70971,the hood is very very light/thin material.,70971,4
70971,I expected a sweatshirt like hood but it is more like a thin tee shirt.,70971,4
70971,"however, I'm happy with it for fall and spring but I will need to get something heavier for winter.",70971,4
70972,"Really like these... the color was more pink than coral, but the return process was easy, and I appreciate that.",70972,4
70972,I will likely order the 6 pack... more subdued colors.,70972,4
70973,I love that it has a clip to hold up against your own ponytail.,70973,4
70974,Beautiful and fits perfectly!,70974,4
70974,My only complaint is with the description of the product.,70974,4
70974,My bracelet has 115 beads.,70974,4
70974,"To be honest, it doesn't matter that much to me, but 108 is a very important number for meditation in some cultures.",70974,4
70974,I just don't appreciate the false advertising.,70974,4
70974,"Still a pretty beacelet, though.",70974,4
70975,I ordered this dress two sizes bigger than what I am & it still fit way too small.,70975,4
70975,I was upset but I just gave it to my mom.,70975,4
70975,The material isn't the best but the dress is super cute.,70975,4
70975,Hey...you get what you pay for.,70975,4
70976,Just got the bracelet and I eagerly opened up the package and put it on.,70976,4
70976,"Size wise, its a great fit.",70976,4
70976,"Not too tight, not too loose, will stay in place.",70976,4
70976,"The string has me a bit worried, like I could catch this and it will just snap, but time will tell if that's an unfounded fear.",70976,4
70976,"Color wise, the beads are as described and are accurate to the picture.",70976,4
70976,What isn't the same is the color of the coin.,70976,4
70976,"The pictures show a bright clean coin attached, mine looks like it got a dose of the same color stain as the beads.",70976,4
70976,"I will admit, I like the one I got better because it doesn't make the coin stand out while wearing it.",70976,4
70977,Took off one start as the tab that covers the zipper was not on the pajamas I received.,70977,4
70977,Was worried the zipper might poke my son but so far doesn't seem to be an issue.,70977,4
70978,I was so disappointed that it didn't fit.,70978,4
70978,That was my second order that I had to send back.,70978,4
70978,I read the reviews and checked the size chart.,70978,4
70978,I think it runs 2 sizes too small.,70978,4
70979,"Very good, legs ride up some but not as much as other brands.",70979,4
70980,I bought this as a present for my boyfriend.,70980,4
70980,It looks exactly as expected.,70980,4
70980,I would order a size smaller than you normally wear though.,70980,4
70980,"Hes an XL, so thats what I ordered and its very big.",70980,4
70980,Other than that its was perfect,70980,4
70981,Never tried ES before but glad these were the first.,70981,4
70981,A little still and bulky around the heel but once broken in...,70981,4
70981,So much love towards your feet.,70981,4
70981,Definitely getting another pair.,70981,4
70982,I'm bigger busted so a little tight but will work for resort wear.,70982,4
70983,Adorable and is getting the job done!,70983,4
70984,Somewhat small in the bust area.,70984,4
70984,I ordered a size up.,70984,4
70985,"Very nice, a bit larger than anticipated for my 4 year old.",70985,4
70986,The only downside is none of the pairs even remotely fit two or three year olds,70986,4
70987,The board shorts looks great and seem high quality that O'Neill is known for but they are way too big.,70987,4
70987,(See pic)  I bought a size 32 and even measured myself at 33 inch waist before I purchased.,70987,4
70987,"I am also a 32 in almost everything else, but these are measuring close to 36.",70987,4
70987,Since they are board shorts there is no elastic and therefore very little room to make them tighter.,70987,4
70987,I have them on as tight as possible in the picture.,70987,4
70987,I honestly do not know what size I should try to get now when I return them.,70987,4
70987,I am afraid even a 30 will be too big.,70987,4
70987,I am giving 4 stars for now and will update once I get the replacement.,70987,4
70989,"Came with this weird odor, but i received it before the the expected date.",70989,4
70989,For the price it is really good.,70989,4
70990,I just put them in my shoes and felt almost instant relief.,70990,4
70992,Size 34 c and I got a large the bra fits just a little big,70992,4
70993,"A tad big at XL size (EU medium), but it looks great, and the slightly hanging part due size can easily be hidden with a jacket and such.",70993,4
70993,"Seems to be good quality material, and the colour dye is great and strong.",70993,4
70994,"Cute, but they little too big for my daughter.",70994,4
70995,Lovely trouser socks - exactly what I was looking for.,70995,4
70995,Feminine but dressy enough for work.,70995,4
70996,I LOVE these sunglasses!!!,70996,4
70996,They literally just arrived.,70996,4
70996,The reason they get 4 stars from me is because they arrived scratched.,70996,4
70996,":(
The scratch is on the left lense, in the lower third of the lense closer to the nose.",70996,4
70996,It's about an inch long thickest at the top of the scratch and the lower portion of the scratch is almost not noticeable.,70996,4
70996,***For $60 they should arrive scratch free.,70996,4
70996,"Not happy about it, but I'll rock them either way....",70996,4
70996,I actually purchased BOTH colors.,70996,4
70996,This is for the black/clear tortoise with purple lenses.,70996,4
70996,The brown tortoise with green lenses are not arriving till the end of the week.,70996,4
70996,"I'm praying since those were $20 more, they arrive scratch free.",70996,4
70996,They are larger mirrored glasses which is exactly what I wanted.,70996,4
70996,I'd love to post a photo if I can figure out how....,70996,4
70997,Vey pretty but very small.,70997,4
70997,This is Like a S/M at best.,70997,4
70999,Very comfortable and stylish,70999,4
71000,Looks exactly like the picture.,71000,4
71001,It is as pictured.,71001,4
71001,I ordered two sizes up which usually works well for me but when this came it is quite large in the arms.,71001,4
71001,Maybe it is made this way intentionally but it's not a look I care for.,71001,4
71001,It's to expensive to send back so I'll try to take it in or give to a friend.,71001,4
71001,"The fabric is good and it is put together fair, which is what you get with purchase from over seas.",71001,4
71002,Great dress fit as expected,71002,4
71003,Didn't go tight enough for my 5 yr old son but was able to put a little knot in the back to tighten it and it worked perfect!,71003,4
71004,every nice shirt but a little big.,71004,4
71004,I normal wear medium but should of gone with a small,71004,4
71005,A little hard to snap but otherwise excellent.,71005,4
71006,purchased this for a wedding I attended in Chicago.,71006,4
71006,Took it to my seamstress for a little tuck here and there so that it fit me and gave the hourglass look in the photo.,71006,4
71006,My seamstress was able to work with the dress easily.,71006,4
71006,I wore a body shaper slip under the dress and it looked amazing.,71006,4
71006,"The item arrived quickly, well packaged; and looks just like the photo.",71006,4
71006,Dress was comfortable for the wedding and the reception.,71006,4
71007,"They look good, but are just a hair small.",71007,4
71007,"She doesn't have large thighs at all, usually wears mediums in things, but these kept wanting to roll down.",71007,4
71007,"Like, almost immediately after pulling them up they are rolling back down.",71007,4
71008,"Beautifully made and gorgeous color, but WAY too small.",71008,4
71008,"I ordered a size 2 for my twenty-month old, thinking that she'd get several months wear out of these but it looks like she'll barely get a month out of them.",71008,4
71008,She has another pair of Leveret jammies in size 2 and they are baggier and fit a little bigger than these.,71008,4
71008,"These ones are very snug, so much so that her little belly hangs out of them and the pants barely make it to her ankles.",71008,4
71008,"I would recommend these, and would definitely order again, just be sure to size up!",71008,4
71009,I love this suit!!,71009,4
71009,"Ordered it for my daughters ""mermaid"" party and ended up wearing the bottoms all summer!",71009,4

71009,I'm a size 8 with 36 D chest.,71009,4
71010,Runs small so order a size up,71010,4
71011,Soft and smooth feeling on the skin I haven't had a run or tear yet and love the way they feel and look.,71011,4
71011,"Slightly sheer sizes are as expected and no rubber around the top for holding the stocking which I personally don't like, but is a challenge to find them without anymore.",71011,4
71011,I would definitely purchase these again,71011,4
71012,Very pretty and fits perfectly,71012,4
71013,Doesn't support well in the chest area however I do have a larger size chest.,71013,4
71013,This product fits well otherwise.,71013,4
71014,"It is a quality case, but the inside dividers ended up being a bit small.",71014,4
71014,"Ended up just taking it out, still works fine.",71014,4
71014,"Maybe tweak the pockets design, then five stars, for sure!",71014,4
71016,It fitted a bit tight but i been using it and it haven't gotten ugly.,71016,4
71016,The decorative stones still there non have fallen.,71016,4
71018,Material a bit light weigh.,71018,4
71019,"Cute pj's for the price, fit on the small size for sure but they still worked for my 4 year old!",71019,4
71020,This is a very nice shirt but the size runs small.,71020,4
71020,"I usually wear a Columbia women's shirt medium but this was a little tight, especially for an outside work shirt.",71020,4
71021,I normally wear a 14-16.,71021,4
71021,I ordered the 3xl and it fit well.,71021,4
71022,The package arrived on time ans the size is very good.,71022,4
71022,(the arms are a little tight but otherwise everything is okay.),71022,4
71022,I like it !,71022,4
71023,"Very nice cap, has very good materials.",71023,4
71024,Cool shoes cor kids.. Theu love them..,71024,4
71025,Fits great but not suitable for large busts.,71025,4
71025,It started coming apart at the seams after the 3rd use right under the bust area.,71025,4
71025,It makes me so slim and no muffin top in tight fitting jeans.,71025,4
71026,These were purchased in hopes of putting off hip replacement surgery.,71026,4
71026,"That didn't work, but I still wear them in my shoes.",71026,4
71027,"Beautiful , a bit small !",71027,4
71028,But it s up for a Christmas present at this time,71028,4
71029,The only thing I dislike about this's read is that it was big in underarms area as well as at the bottom.,71029,4
71029,Otherwise I like the dress.,71029,4
71029,It does not have white under the lace but instead it is a tan color.,71029,4
71030,Exactly what we expected.,71030,4
71032,Am giving it a four star cos I don't know how long it'll stay this beautiful..,71032,4
71032,But its love @ first sight,71032,4
71033,"I love the jacket, but it does not run true to size.",71033,4
71033,"I debated about sending it back, but was afraid the large might not fit properly.",71033,4
71033,"I usually wear a small for my 5' 61/2"" and 126 pound frame.",71033,4
71033,I am so glad I ordered a medium.,71033,4
71033,If your hips are anything but tiny order two sizes up.,71033,4
71033,It fits tight in the bust area and hips.,71033,4
71034,"I ordered this skirt knowing there was a good chance it wouldn't fit me, seeing as I'm a little on the chunky side with a soft mommy tummy.",71034,4
71034,But I read through the reviews and people were talking about how stretchy it was so I decided to try it.,71034,4
71034,"It came in and to my surprise, it fit my 160 pound size 14 self.",71034,4
71034,I think this skirt would truly fit just about anyone US size 14 and under.,71034,4
71034,"I took off one star because my husband said it looks the tiniest bit translucent, although that's probably just because of how snug it is on me",71034,4
71035,Wish they were smaller.,71035,4
71035,Thought the picture was a close-up...,71035,4
71035,"But, its probably a little bigger than I expected!",71035,4
71035,"My mom does not like them but I modified them and made them not dangle as much so as to not put so much weight on my ears.seemed to help, and I think they are cute, going to wear them with my ""Enderman Moving Co."" T-shirt.",71035,4
71035,I added a few pictures to help you see what I'm talking about.,71035,4
71035,"Still, it looks great and i think it will grow on me.",71035,4
71036,The bathing suit arrived in a nice ziploc-closure pouch in great shape.,71036,4

71036,I typically wear mediums.,71036,4
71036,"This suit fit my bust very well, but I could have gotten away with a large, since the cups offer good coverage and the straps are adjustable.",71036,4
71036,The bottoms cover my navel without having any butt hanging out the bottom.,71036,4
71036,I feel super cute in it!,71036,4
71036,"The only downside I found was that the cups and straps don't seem to be strongly sewn together, so I will be adding some security stitches before doing any kind of serious aquatic activity.",71036,4
71037,"these are ferfect for gifting, they have apparently had a lot of work put into them",71037,4
71038,"A little long since I'm 5'2"", but cute and I will be wearing it.",71038,4
71039,The look is great but it takes some time to break in.,71039,4

71043,many compliments but for long walks,71043,4
71045,I LOVE THIS DRESS!,71045,4
71045,Only complaint is the shoulder area is a little tight but I knew that from reading reviews before I purchased.,71045,4
71045,I have to wear a slip underneath.,71045,4
71045,This dress is beautiful though and I get so many compliments on it.,71045,4
71045,I am so happy with my purchase!,71045,4
71046,"I bought this for my son, and he's a very active 11 year old, he loved them and he used them for school constantly!",71046,4

71047,Very cute mermaid outfit and well made.,71047,4
71047,"However, this runs small.",71047,4
71047,My 7 month old barely fits this lengthwise and the product description said 0-12 months.,71047,4
71048,product looks good on.,71048,4
71048,material could be thicker but will work as is.,71048,4
71048,Hopefully it will survive multiple washes.,71048,4
71048,but is definitely a cute look.,71048,4
71050,"THE RING IS BEAUTIFUL, SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!!!",71050,4
71050,I STILL LIKE IT:),71050,4

71053,"Great shied, delivery, and easy to get done.",71053,4
71054,"Beautiful earrings, although I expected them to be a little bigger as pictured in the description on line.",71054,4
71054,I am satisfied with the earrings and will likely purchase other items from GemStoneKing.,71054,4
71055,It arrived as promised and I got it in Red and it's lace in the front and solid in  the back.,71055,4
71055,I normally wear a medium in nicer quality clothing but all other comments suggested  to order up a size so I got a large and it fits well.,71055,4
71055,I will probably hand wash and air dry just to be safe.,71055,4
71056,"My favorite brand of boxer briefs, with only one problem: an unwanted color medley.",71056,4
71056,"Occasionally they sell an all black bundled set, but the random color set seem to pop up like a bad penny.",71056,4
71056,So in this case I needed at least 2 more black boxer briefs and gambled on at least one pair of black in each bundle of three - luckily it paid off.,71056,4
71056,"The other four were one maroon, one grey, one blue, and one blue/grey/white plaid.",71056,4
71056,I guess I can wear those on the weekends if I decide to stay in...,71056,4
71056,Either that or polish the silver.,71056,4
71058,"It fits kinda big, I could've gone with a size L/12 I got a L/14 because L/12 was out of stock.",71058,4
71058,"But other than that, I love the design, and I love the ruffles in the front, definitely hides the mommy tummy!",71058,4
71059,"Great product to wear but it did fit snug for the size stated, which was way smaller than my frame, but so cute that I kept it",71059,4
71060,"I really like this dress, it feels nice and fits well except for the length.",71060,4
71060,I ordered a 12-18m as my daughter just moved into this size and it barely covers her butt.,71060,4
71060,When paired with leggings it works great though!,71060,4
71061,Nice but the sequins itch.,71061,4
71061,Can't complain too much though I looked great.,71061,4
71061,Out of the 1920s.,71061,4
71063,"Cute, made very well was a gift for sis she liked it",71063,4
71064,"With the velcro closure it will fit anyone, but, as with a lot of ball caps the brim could be bigo make the hat look betr in proportion",71064,4
71065,"The necklace on this is too gawdy for me, I actually got a different one to use with the Isis charm.",71065,4
71065,I have earrings that match this perfectly so I do love it otherwise!,71065,4

71067,"I'm 5'3"", 120lbs and wear a 34C bra.",71067,4
71067,When opening the package I was really worried I made a mistake in ordering a size up.,71067,4
71067,"After trying on, the fit is a little loose but not too big.",71067,4
71067,I'm very excited about this suit for the price!,71067,4
71067,The bottoms are very low cut but the top is flattering and nice.,71067,4
71068,Decent product for the money,71068,4
71069,"Nice jacket, runs small though",71069,4
71070,I thought this dress was nice and classy.,71070,4
71070,Purchased it for my friend's wedding.,71070,4
71070,I ordered a medium.,71070,4
71070,Probably could have gotten a small but the medium still fits okay.,71070,4
71070,"I'm 5'3, muscular build and around 140lbs.",71070,4
71071,Happy with the item.,71071,4
71071,Will order with you more.,71071,4
71072,Seems a bit small for the size.,71072,4
71073,This is the first time I have ever bought clothing from Amazon.,71073,4
71073,"This dress is very cute, and looks dressy.",71073,4
71073,"I am 5""2 and usually wear a 8 or a medium in clothes.",71073,4
71073,"This medium was a little tight, and it's a little short in length even for me.",71073,4
71073,I would buy it again but maybe in a large.,71073,4
71074,"These are a good pair of leggins, but they are very unforgiving of anyone who is not super skinny.",71074,4
71074,"There are some brands that are ""one size fits all"" which are great.",71074,4
71074,"I am not particularly large, being 5'3"" and around 118 lbs, but these are just about too tiny for me, and have very little give, so I will probably have to lose a few pounds before I can wear them comfortably.",71074,4
71074,The quality seems really good though,71074,4
71075,Fits well and and looks cool.,71075,4
71075,That is all there is to it.,71075,4
71077,"I ordered a Lg, it fits a little ""snug"".",71077,4
71077,"The jacket is a little more ""shiny"" than I expected.",71077,4
71077,"High insight, I'd go one size larger because it does have draw strings, that appear to be nylon, so the sides can be drawn in to fit better.",71077,4
71077,"But, I have to admit, the overall fit is sexy and it looks good on me.",71077,4
71077,I simply could not do better for what I paid.,71077,4
71078,"I thought that they fit really well, however they do fall a little bit if you need to do much more than walk around the house.",71078,4
71079,The colors on this dress are so pretty and it fit me very nicely.,71079,4
71080,I got this Swimsuit for my mom.,71080,4
71080,When it came in I was delighted!,71080,4
71080,It looks just like the picture and the quality is very well made.,71080,4
71080,I would definitely buy another one.,71080,4
71081,Top fits fine bottoms fit right.,71081,4
71082,"Other than the pattern not looking appealing for my body and sizing a bit big, this was not a rip off.",71082,4
71082,Just didn't go my way on this top.,71082,4
71083,I really like the look of this swim suit.,71083,4
71083,My only negative point against this suit is there is very little bust support.,71083,4
71084,"REALLY thin fabric, but comfy!",71084,4
71085,"I bought this t-shirt for my daughter, as I wanted the material to be a 50/50 blend, to lessen shrinkage.",71085,4
71085,It's very comfortable for her & she was able to use fabric paint on it for a class project.,71085,4
71085,It came on time & was exactly as described.,71085,4
71086,I have a good opinion of this shirt.,71086,4
71086,"Definitely take everyone's advice to order up, by at least one or two sizes.",71086,4
71086,"The arms are a little snug, but very stretchy so it's still comfortable.",71086,4
71086,I'm not sure why some reviewers thought this shirt was so short?,71086,4
71086,I feel the length is exactly as pictured.,71086,4
71086,"Perhaps there is an issue with quality control, and I just got a good one?",71086,4
71086,"It is thin, but nothing a tank top can't fix.",71086,4
71086,"All in all, I like it.",71086,4
71087,Everywhere I looked online said Roxy Juniors sizes run a little small.,71087,4
71087,"I'm typically a Medium, so I bought a Large instead.",71087,4
71087,This looks like an XL or XXL and ridiculous on me.,71087,4
71087,"I judge it by how far down the armpit seam is in relation to my torso, and it was also nearly twice as wide as it needed to be.",71087,4
71087,"The Large was way too big, even if I was going for slouchy.",71087,4
71087,"If I had to do it over I'd probably get a Small, but I like these sweatshirts fairly fitted looking.",71087,4
71087,"For reference, I'm not a small person.",71087,4
71087,"5'8"", 135lbs, 34A, wide hips, size 10.",71087,4
71087,(Don't you just hate it when reviewers don't tell you if they have a large chest or not?,71087,4
71087,"Anyway-) I would definitely buy this again, just in a smaller size.",71087,4
71088,bought as a gift and he loves it,71088,4
71089,"I'm not sure if it's somewhat small, or if this is how it's supposed to fit, as this is my first waist trainer.",71089,4
71089,"It was hard to get on, but I really like it.",71089,4
71089,"It does wonders for my posture, and once you have it on, it's very comfy.",71089,4
71090,Its a little small but it works.,71090,4
71090,Make sure you check your sizes before you order though....,71090,4
71092,"Fit's great, looks great!",71092,4
71092,"Some of the thread ends are a little pokey, but some nail clippers fixed that.",71092,4
71093,I like the feel of the pants however they are shorter for those who are tall.,71093,4
71094,"Good quality, nice socks",71094,4
71095,Comfy and good quality for the price.,71095,4
71095,The feet are huge!,71095,4
71096,Fit my 4 year old great with room to grow.,71096,4
71096,They are easy to get on and off and my daughter loves them.,71096,4
71097,My granddaughter likes it and that is what matters.,71097,4
71097,Nothing an adult would wear but it isn't designed for that.,71097,4
71099,"Good product, however, I can't see that it widened my boots as much as I'd hoped.",71099,4
71099,Maybe it doesn't work too well on synthetic leather.,71099,4
71100,just right size to hold all stuff I need to carry,71100,4
71101,"Great pants, slightly loser fit and thinner material than traditional Carhartt pants.",71101,4
71101,Very nice for more casual wear.,71101,4
71102,"Clingy on the stomach, but nice look if you have a long blouse to cover.",71102,4
71103,This is a nice charm.,71103,4
71103,The blue stones are darker than pictured so they are not as vibrant as I had hoped.,71103,4
71103,Nevertheless this is a very nice charm and well worth the price.,71103,4
71104,I'm grateful for the long torso.,71104,4
71104,And it gives me a waistline.,71104,4
71105,Hey ladies I just got my shipment in today I waited a very long time to try these bad boys on.,71105,4
71105,That is my only complaint it took a month and a half to get them .,71105,4
71105,My reason for the 4 stars is because there not the exact same as the photo and the star isn't as vibrant and cut like the picture shows.,71105,4
71105,I like these because there different  you don't see a lot of people wearing this type of earrings .,71105,4
71105,I wore them with a space shirt I have and they looked so cute with it .,71105,4
71105,I put the earring on about 9 hours ago and my ears are not red and do not hurt at all .,71105,4
71105,"To be honest for the price these are awesome ,and they are my new favorite I am going to buy a pair for my nieces hopefully they come faster this time .",71105,4
71105,Thank you for reading have a nice day,71105,4
71106,The material was kind of cheap but the fit was good.,71106,4
71106,"The jumpsuit was too long so I'll have to have it hemmed, I'm 5,3 but it was a perfect for my body type.",71106,4
71107,A little tight between the big toe and second toe but overall fit well.,71107,4
71107,I bought a large and wear a 9 1/2 to 10 depending on shoe style.,71107,4
71108,Could be a little longer for me.,71108,4
71108,I'm 5'10 and a size 12-14.,71108,4
71108,"It still works, tho.",71108,4
71109,It's a very nice wallet.,71109,4
71109,My cards were constantly breaking with my other wallet so it was time for a new one.,71109,4
71109,Just wish this held just a little more but I definitely like it.,71109,4
71110,"Love this purse, I get so many compliments on it.",71110,4
71110,Only problem I had was the stitching on the side of the longer straps coming undone.,71110,4
71110,"Oh, and it smelt really bad on the inside, I had to leave a car freshener in it for a couple of days.",71110,4
71111,For the price--not a bad deal.,71111,4
71112,This dress is so adorable!,71112,4
71112,The fit was a little clingy and the material was thankfully not the thin cheap crap.,71112,4
71112,I received several compliments when wearing!,71112,4
71113,pretty short but a good product.,71113,4
71114,Fit is a little small,71114,4
71115,It's short have to wear a legging but I like it,71115,4
71116,I love the skirt style.,71116,4
71116,It's just a little small in the waist.,71116,4
71117,"They are smaller then I expected but over all I like them, they are cuties for casual or dress up affairs!",71117,4
71118,"Nice trim coat, lightweight and comfortable.",71118,4
71118,A great gift item.,71118,4
71120,I've spent many a year shooting doves in uncomfortable T-shirts.,71120,4
71120,I'm looking forward to more comfort this year with this polo-style shirt from Kingsize.,71120,4
71120,Feels airy and comfortable after a single wash.,71120,4
71120,"I can't believe, however, how difficult it was to finally find a shirt of this style.",71120,4
71121,"Great material, great fit (I'm a small to small-medium, and the small fit perfect) BUT the cut up the middle is VERRRRY high.",71121,4
71121,"Like, it's not possible to NOT have leggings on with this ... your crotch will show as will your bum even when standing up straight, and not in the naughty, sexy Halloween costume way, but in the 'Oh S***!",71121,4
71121,"Did she forget to put pants on!?""",71121,4
71121,"I'm 5'7"" 140 lbs, with a relatively fit/slim build.",71121,4
71121,"Otherwise looks amazing, kept me warm, and the material is even better than I expected.",71121,4
71122,very happy with purchase!,71122,4
71123,"I couldn't Wait for this item to arrive and true to form, was not disappointed.",71123,4
71123,"While the fabric is a little thin, the way it hugs every curve is Wonderful!",71123,4
71124,I loved this blouse from the moment I saw it.,71124,4
71124,I don't regret getting this blouse,71124,4
71125,"Material was light, perfect for summer wear.",71125,4
71125,I wore it under a vest with boots and wranglers.,71125,4
71125,Great price... Great value.,71125,4
71126,It's a very cool/fun gift that'll keep you warm.,71126,4
71126,"However it was a little large for me, but it wasn't much of a bother and you'll get used to it if you decide to purchase ;)",71126,4
71127,Everything about this bracelet is beautiful except it is a little tight.,71127,4
71127,"I don't have big wrists, in fact quite bony.",71127,4
71127,It is elastic but meant for tiny people lol.,71127,4
71127,"But it is very pretty, I am wearing this for my wedding in exactly.one month",71127,4
71128,O...k....material but runs small.,71128,4
71129,"Based on the reviews, I thought that the brown dress was going to be maroon.",71129,4
71129,"Either I misunderstood, or they fixed the color.",71129,4
71129,The dress I got is like a brownish rust color.,71129,4
71129,"I don't think that I would have picked it, but I do like it.",71129,4
71129,"Also, the ruffle around the top is quite a bit larger than I expected.",71129,4
71129,I trimmed mine off because I felt like a clown.,71129,4
71129,"I'm 5'7"", and I would say that the dress hits mid shin, if you are estimating length.",71129,4
71130,This ring seems to run a full to half size small.,71130,4
71130,It doesn't have any noticeable scratches after wearing for several weeks and I do a fair amount of manual labor while wearing it.,71130,4
71130,No reaction or marks from ring and haven't taken it off since I put it on...mostly because it's small and I can't get it off my finger.,71130,4
71131,"My granddaughter loves it but keeps saying to get her the right size it runs larger than size, but she will grow into it",71131,4
71132,Read the reviews and decided to order it.,71132,4
71132,It's a little big BUT still looks nice.,71132,4
71132,"You have to watch the way you clamp it to your nose because if you stretch it too much, it'll be hard to fit and may fall out.",71132,4
71132,I lost mine after getting it the other day and decided to order another.,71132,4
71132,"I've had my nose pierced times in my life, my nose always rejects the piercing.",71132,4
71132,So this is perfect.,71132,4
71133,But was hoping it came with a Pandora pouch to put it in.,71133,4
71133,Instead it came with a flimsy box and wrapped in tissue.,71133,4
71133,I had ordered another charm from someone else.,71133,4
71133,And that came with a pouch.,71133,4
71134,Super cute and perfect for early cruiser/walker.,71134,4
71134,Run a little big as my 10 month old has pretty cubby feet and still a bit big but still serve their purpose,71134,4
71135,This swimsuit is beautiful and was very well made.,71135,4
71135,My only complaints are that the legs ride up in the top and there was a lot of black fuzz in the swimsuit itself when I first tried it on.,71135,4
71135,"Other than that, it's great.",71135,4
71135,I ordered a size 12 and I weigh 150 pounds and it fit great.,71135,4
71136,"Very cute and warm, but too small for me and my friends heads.",71136,4
71137,"Item wasn't for me, ordered for a friend's boyfriend.",71137,4
71137,Meant to be more of a fun gift.,71137,4
71137,Person did try on and said they seemed a little snug for someone with larger calves.,71137,4
71138,Super cute and comfortable,71138,4
71140,I use these for my eyebrow ring.,71140,4
71140,Looks great and are easy to get in.,71140,4
71140,They hold and secure very well.,71140,4
71141,"The waist is a bit bigger than I thought, but the pants are just wonderful.",71141,4
71143,The look is just like the picture and the material is great but the dress is about a half.size too small I am a 3XL all day and it was a.snug fit.,71143,4
71144,they're good enough for whatever your doing.,71144,4
71144,"they do feel a little flimsy but, they are fine.",71144,4
71145,"its ok, clothing comes from China",71145,4
71147,bit larger than expected.,71147,4
71148,I have bought 3 and finally kept one for me!,71148,4
71149,"Runs a touch small, but a nice fabric.",71149,4
71150,These horns are light weight and easy to wear with a clear headband.,71150,4
71150,You can't even feel them when they are on.,71150,4
71151,"It's great, I just have to lose some weight.",71151,4
71152,I'm pleased thus far it has lift & shape to my rear.,71152,4
71153,Double thickness feels very warm.,71153,4
71153,I live in Hawaii and saving it to wear to colder places.,71153,4
71153,"My only disappointment is that I thought the top ""mushroom part"" was going to be larger-wider.",71153,4
71153,From the photo it looks like a good pouf to the top.,71153,4
71153,"But apparently the brim or part that goes around your head is nice, tightly woven, fresh out of the package; but not stretched out to the size of a person's head so the proportion isn't the same as in the photo.",71153,4
71153,"When I pulled it down to cover my ears, it looks more like a cap with a little fullness or pouf.",71153,4
71153,I really like the beret style and thought this is what I was getting.,71153,4
71153,Guess I have to let it sit more on the top of my head to get the effect and when I pull it down to cover my ears forget style.,71153,4
71153,Still it should be very warm.,71153,4
71154,Tracking confusion and slow to receive but it's beautiful and looks amazing :) thanks again,71154,4
71155,very good especially the price.,71155,4
71156,The top fit perfectly but the bottom part was small for my butt.,71156,4
71156,I ordered a large in hopes that it would fit and it is still pretty snug but overall I love the bathing suit for what it is.,71156,4
71157,"Like the loose fit (ordered L, im size 10, 5'6), the material is just fine, the colors -orange is kind of soft not bright as shown, but nice.",71157,4
71157,Comfy for home or super relax/beach outfit.,71157,4
71158,"It's just a little snug through the bust, but is very flattering overall.",71158,4
71159,I really love it!,71159,4
71160,I am normally a S but ordered an XL per the size chart and it fits perfect and is super cute!,71160,4
71161,Beautiful but didn't fit,71161,4
71163,"The bag is advertised as a shoulder tote, but when I have items in the bag and put it on my shoulder, it is right up under my armpit.",71163,4
71163,"This is not comfortable, so I end up carrying it with my hand.",71163,4
71164,Love these yoga pants!,71164,4
71164,Would be 5 stars if they were a little thicker  (I don't like having to worry about panty lines!).,71164,4
71164,But they wash and wear well and the length is perfect.,71164,4
71164,"The color is more of blue-gray than a true navy, but I like it a lot.",71164,4
71165,My daughter loves it!,71165,4
71165,I thought that the quality could of been better...,71165,4
71166,The stretch chino is fricken great.,71166,4
71166,I won't be splitting these seams the next time I'm just doing my thing.,71166,4
71166,And my wife thinks they're sexy.,71166,4
71167,I give it 4 stars cause the clasp in between the legs is a little uncomfortable and the material is a little cheap but it is beautiful for the price and I will order another one .,71167,4
71168,Loving the way it fits but just wish it was ankle length....,71168,4
71168,"I'm 5""6 and have curves but loving it anyway",71168,4
71169,Cute hats but a bit big and long for my 2 week old newborn.,71169,4
71169,Soft material and quick shipping.,71169,4
71170,It made my butt look larger but squeezed it thru the holes n looked a little funny but definitely did the job!,71170,4
71172,Fit the little guy perfectly.,71172,4
71172,"Wish it was a bit bigger though, it won't fit him for much longer.",71172,4
71174,"Ok, so the good was they look adorable and the fit would have been perfect.",71174,4
71174,"However, I couldn't get the molding to work for me at all.",71174,4
71174,It never came out looking good or staying on well.,71174,4
71174,If not for that I would have loved these.,71174,4
71174,As it was I ended up using the 2nd brand I had gotten just in case which had a different anchoring system.,71174,4
71174,If these fangs ever get a change to how you initially fit them I would gladly buy another set to try.,71174,4
71174,"This could just be me being bad at fitting them, and most people are probably fine haha.",71174,4
71175,"Comfy, but why do all pajama jeans fit so different?",71175,4
71175,"This is my third pair, I like that they are a thinner material than my others.",71175,4
71175,"Of my three pairs all the same size, these are in the middle with the originals running most true to size.",71175,4
71175,"If you want a real loose boyfriend jean look, size up!",71175,4
71176,Very cute but somewhat small,71176,4
71178,Ok...didn't realize there is a band of white at bottom of shirt.,71178,4
71179,"I really love this purse, the color is more vivid and a bitter darker than expected but I like it.",71179,4
71179,"The only con is the large center pocket is in the way, it has some smaller pockets but could use more.",71179,4
71179,It fits great on my small shoulders and is easy to carry.,71179,4
71180,"So I'm a 34 B cup,  but growing so most likely a C now.",71180,4
71180,I bought a medium and wear it on the tightest setting and it feels fine.,71180,4
71180,"It's a little weird to put on,  and when I have it on my skin under it feels very warm, I don't know if that's Normal because this is my first binder.",71180,4
71180,It started out giving me the uniboob effect...,71180,4
71180,But after some adjusting (surprisingly by placing my boobs straight forward instead of up and out) it actually seemed to work.,71180,4
71180,"It doesn't flatten me completely,  like I know it wouldn't but secretly hoped, but my boobs are very tissuey- just a gean I got from my mom.",71180,4
71180,"After trying on some shirts I found that some of them worked,  and some of them didn't.",71180,4
71180,"It depended on the material and color and pattern really,  since I love my graphic tees.",71180,4
71180,"I just had hoped to be completely flat,  but I ordered other binders to compare, this one just came the fastest.",71180,4
71180,"I don't know,  I appreciate that it gives me very flat A cups,  but it's not enough for me.",71180,4
71180,"Tl;dr
Works,  just not as well as I hoped.",71180,4
71182,Looked a little bit more feminine.,71182,4
71183,"So, the wings are beautiful.",71183,4
71183,"I received many compliments, however the downside is the finger loop broke within 15 minutes and now has to be carefully sewn back on.",71183,4
71184,Very cheap material but you get what you pay for.,71184,4
71185,Very pretty dress and fit perfectly.,71185,4
71185,Feels a bit long but perfect for a formal occasion.,71185,4
71186,"These fit pretty well but they are too long on me (I'm 5'1"") and the texture isn't ideal but they're good enough tbh.",71186,4
71187,I ordered 8.5 but received 9 instead .,71187,4
71187,Too late to exchange as my daughter has to play in a tournament in just over a week and she needs to get accustomed using it.,71187,4
71187,Other than that they are lovely shoes it cushions well during playing of badminton.,71187,4
71188,Leggings fit as expected.,71188,4
71188,"However, fabric is not a true black so if the fabric stretches to the max (like if you have a luscious booty) it will appear black with white behind it.",71188,4
71189,Gave them as gift.,71189,4
71189,She's always wanted to be a butterfly.,71189,4
71189,Looks exactly like the picture and arrived before delivery date.,71189,4

Tried on for first time and loops for fingers broke off!",71189,4
71189,Still great product and everything else is fine.,71189,4
71189,Just very disappointed by it breaking.,71189,4
71189,I will have to sew the loops back on because she needs it for a festival this weekend.,71189,4
71189,Attached is an image of one of the broken finger loops.,71189,4
71191,"I wanted to be sure it wasn't too small, I ordered a size up from what I usually wear, it is roomy and I like it.",71191,4
71191,It is lightweight and airy.,71191,4
71192,love the robe but the bedroom shoes are very thin,71192,4
71193,I didn't realize that the pony emblem was going to be larger.,71193,4
71193,It's not the huge pony logo but it's bigger than regular.,71193,4
71194,"Nice fit, even though buttons were a little loose, dreas looks nice on.",71194,4
71194,Received lots of compliments.,71194,4
71195,They fit well but the threads of the ripped part are very cheap.,71195,4
71196,Quality is good for the price.,71196,4
71196,Only downside is that a.,71196,4
71196,"Ribbons are used for the laces, which aren't sturdy enough if you're looking for waist reduction and b.",71196,4
71196,"The ribbons are in two pieces, which makes it impossible to lace the corset correctly.",71196,4
71196,Otherwise this runs pretty true to size if you're trying to use it for its stated purpose.,71196,4
71197,"Very warm and comfy pajamas, they fit as expected and were packaged well, arrived on time... good seller, very pleased :)",71197,4
71198,I wanted a pair of shorts that was not too short and these worked well.,71198,4

71198,"I would order more, but the other colors do not come in my size.",71198,4
71199,I gave four stars because I choose my size but it barely fit.,71199,4
71199,I cant wear it.,71199,4
71199,Still thinking I'm going to lose weight.,71199,4
71199,So I kept it.,71199,4
71199,But besides being to small the dress is just like the picture.,71199,4
71199,Can't wait toil in able to wear it.,71199,4
71200,Its ok for the price.,71200,4
71201,This wig was perfect for my cheshire cat costume.,71201,4
71201,It was a bit rough when first taken out of the package but I hung it over night and clipped the bangs to the side like in the photo.,71201,4
71201,I also purchased a wig cap to wear under and brushed it which made a big difference.,71201,4
71202,"good, but why they don't make something that you can put in to your old iphone case.....?",71202,4
71203,Just got it so don't know about longevity.,71203,4
71203,"Got a ""carbon fiber"" face cover and they match perfectly.",71203,4
71204,We did not get the dress on the expected arrival date.,71204,4
71204,The expected date would have left time for alterations if needed.,71204,4
71204,"It was my daughters senior prom, we spent the day before her prom tracking down the dress.",71204,4
71204,"Thanks to the usps for helping us , we got the dress the day of prom 9 hours before prom.",71204,4

71204,It really is a gorgeous dress She had ordered the dress true to her size.,71204,4
71204,Now this dress is not made to be taken on and off jewels will fall off if not careful.,71204,4
71204,I'm satisfied with the fit of the dress.,71204,4
71204,"This dress would have received 5 stars if the jewels was more attached to the dress, not so easy to fall off.",71204,4
71205,Adds an extra bit of gorgeousness to the face.,71205,4
71206,I do not like things tight so I order it a little big but it's  the fit  I like could be shorter I'm 5'3  so I have to have it hemmed,71206,4
71207,"Very fun, lightweight scarf.",71207,4
71207,Great for cold offices.,71207,4
71207,"Delicate, so don't even think about ironing it or washing it much.",71207,4
71207,"Sheds a little, but not a lot.",71207,4
71209,I am very satisfied with these shoes.,71209,4
71210,Slightly deceptive where you think you are getting two rings but you are only getting one other than that they are wonderful drinks excellent quality fit perfectly I am very pleased with this product the rhinestones do not fall out and believe me having five children I can assure you of that,71210,4
71211,"Like the briefs, they are designed for men on the slimmer side.",71211,4

71212,GREAT Fit but does run a bit big!,71212,4
71213,The ties arrived as promised in good condition.,71213,4
71213,Because these ties are for an event they don't have to be of high quality.,71213,4
71213,They will serve their purpose.,71213,4
71214,Pretty fabric and feel.,71214,4
71215,Slightly tight for a plus-size woman.,71215,4
71216,"The dress is lovely, and arrived promptly in good condition.",71216,4
71216,"The only detractions are the fact that it was slightly looser than expected (I ordered a small and I am 5'6 140lbs) and the fact that it is described as ""black"" when it would be more accurately described as being predominantly green.",71216,4
71216,"Otherwise, an excellent dress for a night out!",71216,4
71217,You can adjust it pulling if it's to small !,71217,4

71225,works well for sleep wear.,71225,4
71226,Fits perfectly and easy to remove cards or inserts.,71226,4
71226,10 pages (20 cards/inserts) can make the wallet a bit thick.,71226,4
71227,Cute but I should have ordered as size down,71227,4
71228,The only complain is that got damaged 2nd time of wear.,71228,4
71228,I need to buy fabric shaver to fix the problem.,71228,4
71231,"A little smaller than I expected it to be, but it is a nice tunic.",71231,4

71240,"I bought the jacket for my son, he is totally in love with it",71240,4
71241,"Works ok, not great",71241,4
71242,I needed tie clips since I do a lot of interactions with patients and cant have my tie hitting them as I lean over.,71242,4
71242,These do their job well without tearing my ties.,71242,4
71242,"However, these are not $50 tie clips so don't expect perfectly rounded edges or the paint not to slowly chip off over time.",71242,4
71242,Overall exactly what I needed.,71242,4
71243,"It was a very thin knit but it did fit appropriately, snagged very easily on everything",71243,4
71244,Was very pleased with fit and material of dress for the price.,71244,4
71245,My nephew loved it.,71245,4
71246,"Really cute, love the colors!",71246,4
71246,Fits well and has a high waist that I like.,71246,4
71246,They are a tad see-through in the bottom of you are in childs pose or down dog but if you wear thong undies that will work!,71246,4
71246,I will keep them and wear them but would like to find ones a little thicker.,71246,4
71247,Excellent tie great design!,71247,4
71248,I love this and have worn it with leggings.,71248,4
71248,But I really could have used a size smaller.,71248,4
71248,It appears to run larger.,71248,4
71249,"The band along the bottom is a little tighter than you would expect for this sort of sweater causing the middle to pouch out  a little bit, and the material is sort of  odd, but overall I love this sweater.",71249,4
71250,The plaid pattern is gorgeous!,71250,4
71250,"Lightweight material, but very comfortable.",71250,4
71251,"got this for my GF and she loves the coat, it is not a big warm coat but good for the chilly weather",71251,4
71252,"Looking good, feeling good.",71252,4
71253,This top runs large.,71253,4
71253,I should have bought a smaller size.,71253,4
71255,Hubby and I ordered pink for me and blue for him.,71255,4
71255,Pretty good quality but not perfect on the sewing.,71255,4
71255,This wallet is smaller than we thought it would be.,71255,4
71255,Holds cards well in the center but not much room on outside.,71255,4
71255,"Still, for our purpose they will work great.",71255,4
71255,We ordered a 3 pc.,71255,4
71255,"credit card size magnifying glass with this order and it was not delivered, record is stating it was delivered.",71255,4
71255,Need to contact Amazon to let them know we did not get those items.,71255,4
71256,I haven't wore it yet.,71256,4
71256,As I tried it on I did notice the sequins falling off.,71256,4
71256,It's probably only a one time use.,71256,4
71256,It is very pretty,71256,4
71257,I love this shirt!,71257,4
71258,Lost one in the dryer after the first wash.,71258,4
71258,So I only got to use them once.,71258,4
71259,I bought this dress for my best friends wedding and it is gorgeous.,71259,4
71259,They only this is I don't like all the poofyness other then that it's perfect.,71259,4
71260,"Nice socks but made for skinny Asian legs, not fuller or muscular legs.",71260,4
71260,"I'm a U.S. size 2 dress/pants, not overweight, and the tops are borderline too tight.",71260,4
71260,But the quality is good and the socks are comfy.,71260,4
71261,A little looser than expected.,71261,4
71261,I did not know that the top was all sheer.,71261,4
71261,"I thought it was lightly lined so it could be worn alone, but no such luck.",71261,4
71261,"It's not to be worn as a crop top, but more as lingerie.",71261,4
71262,"I love this, but I am afraid the quality isn't going to be what I thought.",71262,4
71262,"It's darling though, my husband says it's very sexy looking, so that's a pus.",71262,4
71263,The dress is as pictured.,71263,4
71263,"The silver detail is sequins not rhinestones, just FYI.",71263,4
71263,It bunches in an odd place right around my hip area but other than that.,71263,4
71263,Heavy/ Good quality fabric.,71263,4
71263,I did want a zipper in the back instead of corset back.,71263,4
71263,I eMailed and requested that but I think the seller forgot.,71263,4
71264,This bra is a pull-on (as opposed to clasp bra).,71264,4
71264,"Maybe that's evident in pictures and descriptions, but I'm letting you know just in case.",71264,4
71264,"It's comfy, for sure, and offers a lot of coverage.",71264,4
71264,I haven't yet tested it in the water because I'm going to return or exchange the bra I received because it is too big.,71264,4
71264,"I am a 34D; the sizing chart says I'd wear a large (39"" bust).",71264,4
71264,"After reading reviews, I thought a medium would fit better.",71264,4
71264,"Turns out that I may be best off with a small, and I think that might make sense because I'm petite, bust size aside, and I usually wear a small in women's clothing.",71264,4
71264,The issue is that the band is super loose.,71264,4
71264,"That said, the bra conceals my large breasts, but *that* said, a smaller size wouldn't reveal anything.",71264,4
71264,"The medium size isn't giving me the compression I was hoping for, and maybe a smaller size would.",71264,4
71264,"My bathing suit gives me a lot of compression, so even if a small doesn't compress I may keep it because the bra is lightweight and gives a lot of coverage (and will, hopefully, still give me coverage in a small).",71264,4
71264,I think the lesson is that the size chart is more applicable to band than bust size.,71264,4
71264,EDIT: I exchanged the medium for a small.,71264,4
71264,"The band fits much better, and I still have a lot of coverage.",71264,4
71264,But I'm noticing that after about five wears some of the stitching is coming loose.,71264,4
71264,"Maybe this is from the pull on/ pull off struggle over big breasts, or maybe this one out of thousands has a QC issue.",71264,4
71264,"In any case, it's comfortable and non-obtrusive during a lap swim, even if it doesn't offer a high amount of compression.",71264,4
71265,I think it's too short for a dress.,71265,4
71265,I use it as a tunic over leggings instead.,71265,4
71265,If you are curvy this will hike up over those curves and will not lay flat as pictured on the model.,71265,4
71265,"I'm a size 6, 34DD.",71265,4
71266,"a little short for me, but still looks pretty",71266,4
71267,The colors in this are just as pictured.,71267,4
71267,"The scarf is a bit short/small and that means there is not as much  you can ""do"" with it (as other scarves  -- in other words, the ways to style it are limited by its size.",71267,4
71267,"Also, there is nothing about it that feels higher class (it's very thin and the material is ""grainy""), but for the price I honestly did not expect a whole lot.",71267,4
71268,"Good quality, but fairly small",71268,4
71269,"it is on the large side, but very comfortable to wear.",71269,4
71270,"Cute watch but the band was cut piece in the package, odd.",71270,4
71272,"Like other reviewers reported, this bonnet fits small.",71272,4
71272,I ordered a size larger and it ended up being perfect.,71272,4
71272,"There was a tag attached to the hat, and when it was cut off with scissors, there was still a large plastic hold.",71272,4
71272,This bonnet was so much fun on our baby's first Easter egg hunt since it was so warm that day.,71272,4
71273,Fits my 10 month old perfect.,71273,4
71273,The gold bow is sequins.,71273,4
71274,Wish it had better straps.,71274,4
71275,"The ""high low""  hem was much shorter in the  back compared to the front than the picture make it look.",71275,4
71275,They really seem more like  they are intended to be loosely tied.,71275,4
71275,"Thin and lightweight material,  but not cheap feeling.",71275,4
71276,"If you are between sizes, go up a size.",71276,4
71276,"If you are a true medium, buy the medium.",71276,4
71278,"Colors are vivid and brighter than I thought, very eye catching.",71278,4
71278,"Great for the Holidays with white, black or red cardigan.",71278,4
71278,I wore it twice with a White and the a Red top with lots of compliments.,71278,4
71278,The two side pockets (barely noticeable) were a surprise and and a delight!,71278,4
71278,The fabric is great for all weather.,71278,4
71279,These are exactly what I have been looking for.,71279,4
71279,They have cargo pockets and the right side is setup for carrying my cell phone!,71279,4
71279,"They are extremely comfortable, fit well and the details of manufacturing are superb!",71279,4
71279,You will not be disappointed in these.,71279,4
71279,The price is amazing for what they are.,71279,4
71279,I will be ordering more!,71279,4
71279,"*** April 2, 2016 Update ***
I wanted to share that I have been wearing these daily and have many wash cycles on them and they are holding up beautifully.",71279,4
71279,The color looks as good as the day I purchased them.,71279,4
71279,I have a told of four pairs now.,71279,4
71279,Truly worth the 5 star rating.,71279,4
71279,"*** April 18, 2016 Second Update ***
I ordered two more pairs of these and I had to send them back.",71279,4
71279,The hem on the pants was not finished.,71279,4
71279,I had given 5 stars as I had posted earlier however felt I had to lower to 3 stars due to a quality control issue with my recent order.,71279,4
71279,"*** April 19, 2016 3rd Update ***
I received replacement for the two pairs that had issues.",71279,4
71279,Both of the replacements are fine.,71279,4
71279,"No problems, I'm a happy camper once again.",71279,4
71279,Stars moved up a notch to 4 stars.,71279,4
71280,It's a little snug for the size but it's made if quality materials.,71280,4
71280,There is no stretch.,71280,4
71280,It is well packaged to protect the skirt in transit as well.,71280,4
71282,I bought this jacket for a halloween costume and it's awesome except one downside it that the jacket seems to be a tad shorter than I expected.,71282,4
71282,But it's not like I'm going to wear this everyday and the price was ok.,71282,4
71282,However if you like to design clothes I would just make the jacket.,71282,4
71283,I had it for over 4 months now and still looks and fits great.,71283,4
71284,"I really like this kimono, but the fit is very large.",71284,4
71284,Most reviews stated it to be small.,71284,4
71284,"I am 5' 3"" and 130 lbs.",71284,4
71284,I wear M/L tops since I am quite chesty.,71284,4
71284,I ordered a large so it would be flowy.,71284,4
71284,There is a ton of fabric and I would have been much more comfortable in the Medium.,71284,4
71284,Great buy though and I would buy from them in the future!,71284,4
71285,i ordered the wrong size but same as picture,71285,4
71286,too small but looked great once we got to fit for a wedding,71286,4
71287,Beautiful piece but the chain is incredibly short.,71287,4
71287,It's choker style in an average size neck.,71287,4
71287,On a heavier person it wouldn't fit at all.,71287,4
71287,It would be five start if the chain were an inch or two longer.,71287,4
71288,Quality of the corset is very good.,71288,4
71288,I am a size 8-10 in womens and needed a large.,71288,4
71288,Overall was very satisfied with waist Trainer.,71288,4

71290,Has a nice silky feel to it.,71290,4
71290,The size chart threw me off.,71290,4
71290,I ordered a size too big.,71290,4

71291,if it becomes available in BLUE again i would buy an other one.,71291,4
71292,"i love it, I'm just very tall and was nervous to buy this i am 5'9 and got a large and its a tad short",71292,4

71295,It was very comfy and great to wear for my summer baby shower.,71295,4
71295,Having a long dress while sitting and opening gifts in front of an audience was super important!,71295,4

71300,"Great fascinator but it is not a headband, it is just affixed to a hair clip.",71300,4
71301,Good for the price.,71301,4
71303,"I was traveling fro Florida to Minnesota in February, and the temperatures were below zero.",71303,4
71303,"This Florida gal was not prepared for that type of cold, so I ordered these tights, and boy, were they warm!",71303,4
71303,I was not cold at all - I could wear them under my jeans or if I wanted to wear a skirt and they were perfect!,71303,4

71337,Love the idea of lifetime warranty but not sure I'll need to use it.,71337,4
71337,Suggestions were given directly to company owner.,71337,4
71337,Nice to know someone cares about their customers.,71337,4
71338,"I liked the shirt but neck was so tight, almost choking me, sent back.",71338,4
71338,"Probably should go up a size if you don't want skin tight, I got pink and white, need to wear something underneath.",71338,4

71359,I love all the pockets and organization and it holds my water bottle.,71359,4

71371,"The print is great and material is high quality but the printed on logo is a little annoying, but only on the front.",71371,4
71371,"It is pretty standard material for digital print graphic clothing,  so don't expect it to be standard sweatshirt material.",71371,4
71371,The tag says dry clean only but you can get away with hand washing and line drying it.,71371,4

71390,I purchased this kit because I needed a 14G needle and jewelry and it was cheaper in the set.,71390,4
71390,"A good thing about this kit is the wipes, clamp and gloves if you chose to use it.",71390,4
71390,I did need to pierce some harder tissue (nipple) and it seems at times that the needles were not sharp enough.,71390,4
71390,One of the needles used weren't big enough for the jewelry to push through.,71390,4
71390,But I was able to push it through.,71390,4
71390,The straight barbells are a little short for my taste.,71390,4
71390,When you pierce something you want a little longer jewelry in case of swelling and the jewelry in this is like a post heal size.,71390,4
71390,Over all I would say buy this kit if you don't want to spend a lot of money however if you have more to spend buy just the jewelry and needles seperate.,71390,4
71391,"The buckles needed to be attached, which was a simple fix.",71391,4

71392,"But I am wearing it for an outdoor wedding next week, so I don't have time to return it.",71392,4
71392,"It doesn't have a care tag inside, but their description gives an idea how to wash it.",71392,4
71392,"The legs are too long for me, but I expected they would be.",71392,4
71392,"I'm now looking for tall summer sandals, or possibly will try the iron-on hemming fix.",71392,4
71392,"The top is a tad big, and gaps open when I bend over, exposing my bra.",71392,4

71392,"The material is forgiving, and this is very cute on!",71392,4
71392,The background color is very dark navy.,71392,4

71392,"Even with the sizing issues, I love it, and will work around them.",71392,4

71392,"Bottom line, order it!",71392,4
71392,"But if you're in between sizes, I would get the smaller size.",71392,4
71393,Expected to be bigger,71393,4
71394,Nice great gift for women/girls,71394,4
71395,Seems a little bigger them I was expecting.,71395,4

71404,"It shipped in 2 weeks, was here before the expected date.",71404,4
71404,I would definitely purchase more products from this seller!,71404,4
71405,I got these at a decent price so I can't complain too much.,71405,4
71405,"However, there was a yellow marker stain on the black part in the back.",71405,4

71411,Ran a little small on my 18 month old.,71411,4
71412,"I really like the unique look - the style of the top, however because of the deeper arm cut, my daughter will need to wear a tank top under it.",71412,4

71416,You will also need a pair of white thigh high and red heels to complete the look.,71416,4
71417,Really adds some extra snazz to a gift.,71417,4
71417,"I used this for a proposal to my girlfriend, who is now my fiance and it really does highlight the ring and make it stand out.",71417,4
71417,"My fiance was almost more impressed with the box than the ring :)

Only one downside to look out for.",71417,4
71417,The slot does not grip the ting too well.,71417,4
71417,"I had a matched set in there, and had to stop and check frequently as the rings would come loose and rattle around in the box.",71417,4
71417,Could cause a misshap if you're not careful with ensuring everything is inserted and aligned correctly prior to 'the presentation',71417,4

71424,Runs somewhat small but after reading the reviews on here I ordered one size larger than what I normally wear.,71424,4
71424,I'm 5'4 and weigh 150 and got sz large.,71424,4
71424,I'm giving a 4 star simply because the fabric is kinda thin and see-thru if you don't wear dark underwear and bra.,71424,4
71425,This dress was perfect for our wedding!,71425,4
71425,I definately reccomend ordering 1-2 sizes up because it ran small on every bridesmaid in my wedding party.,71425,4
71425,The dress was quality- the only issue we had was the zipper was kind of hard to zip.,71425,4
71425,But other than that the material was nice and the dress was well constructed.,71425,4
71425,"All of my bridesmaids were 5'5"" or less and the dress fell right at the knee.",71425,4

A must for winter ....
classy but shapely..
the bottom if it was more fitted would make it better",71428,4
71432,Nice but the 2 pack means only two straps as shown not what is pictured times 2......,71432,4
71433,"I like the size and all the things it shows, but it is a bit too complex to set up the timer.",71433,4
71434,"These are great, nice fit",71434,4
71436,They look like slippers but they are definitely more like socks that have a slipper look.,71436,4
71436,Very soft and warm :),71436,4
71437,This set is beautiful but clasp do pinch the ears if worn all day.,71437,4

71449,"I have a blue one I bought from a local department store months after getting this one that looks a little better, but I bought this when they first came out with the print.",71449,4
71450,A little big under the arms (bra is exposed) but otherwise is great!,71450,4
71451,It does what it is supposed to do and it's comfortable.,71451,4
71453,"I think it does what it says, but it's kind of silly looking.",71453,4

71454,"It's a little darker than the photo, it looks more like a grayed denim.",71454,4
71454,"That's ok though, because it adds to the look.",71454,4
71454,"Sometimes you have to worry about canvas bags being too rigid when you first get them, this one is very pliable and has a broken in feel.",71454,4
71454,"As other comments have noted, there is no structure for laptops, so it's buyer beware if you're using this as a laptop bag.",71454,4
71454,"My only real complaint is that there is no handle on the top of the bag, this sounds petty, but picking it up by the shoulder strap or just grabbing a handful of the bag is annoying.",71454,4
71454,I will continue to use the bag though because it looks great and so far is very durable.,71454,4
71456,the fingerholes for the wings are quite tight for an adult size but otherwise the costume was great for the price!,71456,4

71457,I material does not look cheap.,71457,4
71457,Tight in all the right places.,71457,4

71458,It's thin and sheer so I will wear a tank under it.,71458,4
71458,The photo shows that it's 3/4 lenght but the one I ordered was long sleeves (kinda they weren't quite long but not 3/4 so I rolled the sleeves to 3/4).,71458,4
71458,I would say hang or lay flat to dry.,71458,4

71466,I have a small butt .. 38D .. muffin top .. no hips 150lbs and 5'3  so let's talk about the fit .. the cups for the bra angle out at the bottom so I'm thinking I may sew a back strap you guys should make smaller swimsuits with a bigger bust because it's kinda puffy and loose by my butt hopefullyni can wash it and shrink it a little,71466,4
71467,Nice dress unfortunately it was too big in the bust area.,71467,4
71467,Tried a size smaller and it was too tight.,71467,4

71477,I was VERY pleased to see that it's just the same!,71477,4
71477,the coloring is a little different of course but it's just as cute as I hoped and I'm excited to wear it.,71477,4

71496,Color is very nice and it does hold a lot of cards.,71496,4
71496,"The fold on the expansion part is a little odd though, and it seems if you don't set the cards in just right, they stick up.",71496,4
71496,It may just be that the leather needs to break in a bit.,71496,4
71497,"The picture makes the shoe look like it has a ""boxier"" toe rather than the ""pointier"" toe that it actually has.",71497,4

71498,I'm pleased with the size and all the compartments and the outside zippered pocket.,71498,4

71504,I wore it yesterday at a family gathering and everyone loved it.,71504,4
71504,Only complaint is that I'm not crazy about the shoelace cord woven through the chain.,71504,4
71504,It would be a bit classier with some nice ribbon which I may do myself.,71504,4
71505,I like it I recommend some other people to buy it...,71505,4
71507,Material is thin and it's not a high quality top.,71507,4
71507,But it is nice for casual wear and it does fit as I thought it would.,71507,4
71508,"Low front, as advertised -- need to wear over tank/bandeau/etc.. Lightweight.",71508,4

71509,in the hotel when I did not want to put on dress shoes.,71509,4
71509,They were comfortable with a bare foot and thin trouser socks.,71509,4
71509,"They don't breathe well though, so feet start to feel a bit sweaty after a wearing them for a while, though they are otherwise comfortable for wearing most of the day.",71509,4
71509,"I wear a 7.5, so the photo gives an idea of the extra give available in the heel, but did not have any problems with them slipping off.",71509,4
71509,Would be great if the company made some with a more breathable upper to increase the comfort.,71509,4
71510,Love the purse but the front pocket zipper separated first time it was zipped now zipper doesn't work.,71510,4
71512,"If it was not for the size (runs smalllll) I would have given it  five stars, because the color is vibrant, the fabric is of fantastic quality and nicely accentuates the curves.",71512,4
71513,Shorter than expected but fits nicely,71513,4
71514,The look and feel of this dress is terrific.,71514,4
71514,Had to buy a size larger than what I normally would.,71514,4
71514,Arrived on time in appropriate packaging.,71514,4
71515,Cute but runs small.,71515,4
71515,I ordered it about 2 sizes bigger so it would fit loose and comfy for spin/ running but it fits snug.,71515,4
71515,It is more like junior sizing.,71515,4

71519,Good ring but faded a little towards yellow gold,71519,4
71520,It's ok.  Too small to button,71520,4
71521,What we were expecting,71521,4
71522,"This shirt fit a little large, but after one wash it was a little better.",71522,4
71522,I love this shirt though.,71522,4
71522,So comfy and soft.,71522,4
71523,The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because the zipper occasionally gets a little stuck.,71523,4
71523,But that is a small price to pay for this awesome little wallet.,71523,4
71523,"I never imagined I could fit so much into this accordion style wallet, but I managed to.",71523,4
71523,I get compliments on it all the time.,71523,4

71536,"I am 5'8"" and about 145 lbs, with a B cup.",71536,4
71536,I typically wear a size 8 in almost all my clothing.,71536,4
71536,I ordered the 3XL (US size 8-10) and it fit perfectly.,71536,4
71536,"I wish the skirt had been slightly longer, but overall, it's a good and flattering fit that hides the flaws of midlife and motherhood.",71536,4
71536,I was surprised at the thickness and level of quality.,71536,4
71536,Great value for the money.,71536,4
71537,"A little snug, would have ordered a size up",71537,4
71538,It fits perfectly on my body the only problem I have is with the breast cups.,71538,4
71538,I'm big breasted so the cups are a little funky.,71538,4
71538,But other than that it's really cute!,71538,4
71539,I am so embarrassed!,71539,4
71539,I bough a ring for myself and since I had no trouble with it except the dark stone that only sparkles in bright light.,71539,4
71539,"Anyway, bought one for my Daughter and she was in town, showed me her ring ....and how it turns her finger green!",71539,4
71539,I checked mine and it was also green with a chip of paint on the band!,71539,4
71539,I have never been so embarrassed I offered to return it for her but she likes the colors ' when' it sparkles.,71539,4
71539,Not sterling silver and WILL turn your finger Green!,71539,4
71541,"I'm 5'10"" 188 pounds, broad chest and back.",71541,4
71541,Feels a tad smaller in comparison to other size L shirts but it's fits me ok.,71541,4
71541,I really like the color and front graphic.,71541,4
71541,Wish the oval Subaru badge was on the sleeve under the Subaru name.,71541,4
71542,looks like photo.all is fine .ty,71542,4
71543,"This is a bit on the thin side, but for the price, I won't complain.",71543,4
71543,"It is as described, and arrived sooner than expected.",71543,4
71544,The color was more yellow than lime green.,71544,4
71544,Reordered and the color is perfect.,71544,4
71545,"I was very reluctant to purchase a shirt that was priced under $20.00 and made in China but, I like the shirt.",71545,4
71545,I honestly Couldn't rate it five stars since I don't know how it will hold up after a few washings.,71545,4
71545,For me I found the fit to be just right.,71545,4
71545,"At 6'-1"" 215 lbs with an athletic build I like my shirts to be somewhat ""fitted"".",71545,4
71545,Obviously sizes vary between different makers but I agree with other reviewers that this F.L brand appears to be closer to accurate than others.,71545,4
71545,"I also ordered the other Amazon banded collar brand ""T_ _"" where many reviewers warned to ""order one size larger than you needed"".",71545,4
71545,I ordered one size larger and it was just right.,71545,4
71546,"I like the arch support, just wish the toe strap was a little longer so it didn't fit quite to snug.",71546,4
71547,"After my first c-section, I found it difficult to wear any panty as the waist band rubbed on my incision and it hurt.",71547,4
71547,Even once the incision had healed the scar was still sensitive.,71547,4
71547,When time was approaching for my second c-section I knew I had to find some other panty that was high-waisted and wouldn't roll down to the incision line.,71547,4
71547,"So I searched and searched, this was the one I ended up getting and I do not regret the purchase.",71547,4
71547,This was much more comfortable to wear than regular undies.,71547,4
71547,The only problem with these is that the silicone patch was just slightly shorter than my incision line.,71547,4
71547,Not sure if my doctor just made my incision a little longer than most or if the silicone patch should be made a little larger.,71547,4
71547,I think the later.,71547,4
71547,I feel this really helped to lose some water weight and added compression in all the right places.,71547,4
71547,It helped just with over all support with the flabbiness of the tummy you have initially.,71547,4
71547,At 3 weeks post-partum this panty was officially too big and I could no longer use it as it started to roll down and begin looking bulked under clothing.,71547,4
71547,So I bought some regular high waisted undies to get me through now till the incision is less sensitive.,71547,4
71547,I am about to purchase another product from this company to help with the little bit of shaping left to be made and the last bit of uterus shrinking that needs to be had.,71547,4
71548,Very nice long vest....the price was terrific.,71548,4
71548,I thought the fit was true to size.,71548,4
71548,I will enjoy wearing it.,71548,4
71549,This item is a Christmas gift for a child in need.,71549,4
71549,I cannot tell you how it will fit because we buy the gift and never see the child.,71549,4
71552,I love the dress only problem is a bit small for my boobs I'm a 34DD but that happens for me with most dresses anyways.,71552,4
71552,I was very impressed with the quality for the price.,71552,4
71552,I got a medium I'm currently 146 pounds and 5'3 the length was also a plus is perfect for me.,71552,4

71565,Just got this the other day.,71565,4
71565,Its super cute but looks a little weird on me cause im kinda chubby lol,71565,4
71566,Could have been a little more spandex in the tummy area - to hold me in.,71566,4
71566,"Felt somewhat week, or I need more help in that area.",71566,4
71567,Very tight fit but i like that hat.,71567,4
71568,This cardigan is well made and the color and texture are lovely.,71568,4

71571,"Pros
Sleek, pretty design (as shown)
""Klips"" stay in place
Sunglass band is snug enough to secure plastic sunglasses, even when turned upside down

71578,It looks great in the photos and not too bad in person.,71578,4

71582,The kids loved them!,71582,4

71597,"I liked it, however, it's not the best quality.",71597,4
71597,"It is a thicker material, but it doesn't really have a shape.",71597,4

71597,"but for the price, I guess it's not that big of a deal.",71597,4
71597,I got both the grey and yellow.,71597,4

71600,What a waste :/ was cute though.,71600,4
71602,Love this bathing suit fits so good and it is very comfy it does run a little small I bought one size bigger and was perfect,71602,4
71603,fit as it should,71603,4
71604,It fits but is hard to get on and off because of waist band:,71604,4
71605,Seems very tight putting it over thighs but fits perfect!,71605,4
71606,The X-small pant which usually fits me for this brand was too small and the small pants are too big but still love koi so I'm sucking it up with the small.,71606,4
71607,This dress was way to small but I contacted the seller and they took care of everything so I have to give them high stars,71607,4
71608,"The kimono is a little long for me, but I am petite so that is normal.",71608,4
71608,"It also either came with a small snag or snagged at some point after I opened it up (may be my hanger, not sure).",71608,4

71611,cool pattern and stretchy.,71611,4
71611,also good for yoga or exercise.,71611,4

71613,It arrived in a timely matter and has held up through washes and wear.,71613,4

71616,:)  Great price and great fit.,71616,4
71617,It fits good and seemed to wash up fine.,71617,4

71620,This sweater fits me perfectly.,71620,4
71620,It is pure wool so it is very warm.,71620,4
71620,I bought a bunch of lighter colored t-shirts to wear underneath it and contrast with the very dark blue of the sweater.,71620,4
71620,"I wear it all day at work, which fortunately is not too hot an environment.",71620,4
71620,There is some slight pilling which may be typical for a wool sweater (and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars).,71620,4
71621,I had to buy two pairs the 38 is actually a 36 there about but I get down to a 36 in summer so I kept them.,71621,4
71621,I ordered a 40 and they fit great.,71621,4
71621,I use them for dress pants in my Fire/Rescue Station there are pockets enough but I don't think they had actually using them in mind.,71621,4
71621,REMEMBER ORDER A SIZE LARGER THAN YOU ARE!!!!,71621,4
71622,Great for the price; esp.,71622,4
71623,Wanted a summer robe and this one fits the bill.,71623,4
71623,I ordered a larger size and didn't need to.,71623,4
71623,A little stiff at first but after a couple of washing it is great.,71623,4
71624,"The robe fits great and is of good quality, but the slippers didn't hold up well at all.",71624,4
71625,Top is a bit small but still fits ok.,71625,4
71625,Bottoms are a bit large.,71625,4

71627,It's been used for about two weeks and is holding up pretty well.,71627,4
71627,Time will tell if the leather holds up.,71627,4
71628,These are great quality; much better than what I expected.,71628,4
71628,I bought size  small 4/6 and they fit more like a 2.,71628,4
71629,"very large, can fit a lot of things but just slight errors in sizes .",71629,4
71630,looks great for the price.,71630,4

71632,Nice jacket for fall!,71632,4
71632,"I'm 5'2 130lbs, ordered a medium and it fits pretty good.",71632,4
71632,"Sort or loose and sleeves go down about to my knuckles, but that doesn't bother me.",71632,4
71632,If I would have gotten a small I think the shoulders would have been to tight.,71632,4
71632,Placed my order on a Thursday got it that next Tuesday.,71632,4
71633,"Good fit, works for nursing.",71633,4
71634,The quality seems good.,71634,4

71635,Should have gotten size 7.,71635,4
71635,After about 3 weeks of wearing this ring it turned my finger green.,71635,4
71635,And that doesn't happen very easily with me.,71635,4
71636,Finally received this bag; only took a few weeks.,71636,4
71636,This is slightly larger than I expected and it isn't yellow like the picture at all; more like a light lime yellow.,71636,4
71636,The inside lining is a very cheap material.,71636,4
71636,There is a zipper compartment in the front which is hidden under a flap; you have to remove a lock to unzip the compartment; don't plan on leaving the lock on since it will be too hard to open this area.,71636,4
71636,There is also a large open pocket in the back which I will use to hold my phone.,71636,4
71636,Doesn't look expensive in any way but will keep and use for every day use.,71636,4
71637,These sandals were comfortable right out of the box and continue to be comfortable.,71637,4
71637,"I just wish they would make more vionic styles with the black footbed, since the lighter colors get too dirty looking too quickly.",71637,4
71637,Also would be good if they added some more modern/fun colors such as metallic gold and some more fashionable options that have the same kind of closure that this shoe has instead of a buckle.,71637,4
71637,These are easier to get on and off due to the velcro straps.,71637,4
71637,they should use those straps on all their shoes!,71637,4
71638,"Logo is printed on, and will eventually show wear after repeated washing, but very happy with quality.",71638,4
71638,It is a very good replica.,71638,4
71639,I was pleasantly surprised of the quality.,71639,4
71639,Very soft and good quality material.,71639,4
71639,Unfortunately I returned it because it didn't fit.,71639,4
71639,I ordered the wrong size so that's my fault.,71639,4
71639,Although I feel like it was a bit longer that I expected.,71639,4
71640,I wish the material was better.,71640,4
71640,It looks kind of cheap because of the appearance and texture of the material.,71640,4
71640,Otherwise it has a nice fit and look.,71640,4
71641,I like the buckle.,71641,4
71641,The leather belt seems light and cheap to me thou.,71641,4
71641,I'd be willing to pay more for higher quality.,71641,4
71641,"Can't comment on durability yet, too early",71641,4
71642,Good quality shirt- given as a gift so I can't say much more.,71642,4
71645,The belt is stiff even after use mostly from the metal part but if you don't mind that this product is good,71645,4
71648,Alittle small for a guy with big hands,71648,4
71649,Arrived quickly and is just as pretty as it appears online.,71649,4
71649,"Unfortunately,  I had to return since the size small was too big for my daughter.",71649,4
71650,Just what I hoped for,71650,4
71651,my bra size is a 34C and while the colors are cute and the material is very comfortable the bandeaus themselves fit very large.,71651,4
71651,"as long as I don't move too quickly it looks great, but any type of vigorous activity causes an epic wardrobe malfunction.",71651,4
71651,I definitely recommend these for anyone with a larger chest but if you're on the smaller side they might not work for you.,71651,4
71652,Fair shipping time and a good price.,71652,4
71652,"Everything I expected and it fit just right , I like a shirt that is a tad big  !",71652,4
71653,"It's a cheap scarf and while it looks good, you can tell.",71653,4
71653,"But I bought it to stay warm, and it does just that!",71653,4
71654,It's nice but it's to big and I used sizing chart when I measured.,71654,4
71654,Also my torso is longer so it.hits below my rib cage and bothers me.,71654,4
71654,But it's still a good product for a more rounded shorter torsoed person.,71654,4
71655,Really comfy and looks like the image shown.,71655,4
71655,The only thing that I can say is that the sleeves are a little short (don't go all the way down my wrist) but it's adorable.,71655,4
71656,These are a surprisingly good quality for the price.,71656,4
71656,"They seem a bit small, though, there is very little room for the slouch in the back.",71656,4
71656,The yarn is stretchy (and not at all itchy) and the colors are very rich.,71656,4
71657,"Simple hat, keeps the sun off my ears and some of my face.",71657,4
71657,Works in any casual environment.,71657,4

71658,Very nice it feels comfortable looks just like the pic,71658,4
71660,I ordered this band for my pebble time steel.,71660,4
71660,The reason for it because I have small wrists and the band came with it wasn't adjustable.,71660,4
71660,Just received this band and I LOVE it!.,71660,4
71660,It gives the watch a more classy look than the original.,71660,4

71661,"I thought there was a zipper closing, and there was not.",71661,4
71661,"I'm using it as a purse, not a beach bag.",71661,4

71664,The design and functionality was exactly as pictured and meets my expectations.,71664,4
71664,"The pocket design I have seen done slightly better, but they are no less functional than the others.",71664,4

71665,perhaps is a half size larger.,71665,4
71666,I was excited for all of my boys to have new Jammies but these run really small.,71666,4

71675,Cheap Chinese sweatshop quality shirt HOWEVER the picture is cool as heck and I've received compliments on these tees.,71675,4

71676,"thoughtful design, surprisingly useful",71676,4
71677,Shrinks after washing it.,71677,4
71678,"Surprised I like it as much as I do, stripes worry me.",71678,4
71679,The dress was perfect other than it was slightly big.,71679,4
71679,I laced it up as tight as it would go and the top was still too big.,71679,4
71679,The white wasn't really white but other than that it was an amazing dress.,71679,4

71683,The description is deceiving.,71683,4
71684,"Nicely made, attractive fit, nice material, great value for the money.",71684,4
71684,But fit is too big.,71684,4
71684,I love the jacket itself so will be returning it for a smaller size.,71684,4
71684,I would give the jacket itself 5 Stars; I gave it 4 stars only because of the fit.,71684,4

71693,Now if you good you may be able to fit more.,71693,4
71693,But I have learned the hard way not to over pack any bag.,71693,4
71693,will cause it to rip!,71693,4
71693,Note: for you tactical pack users the material  is of less quality and you can tell.,71693,4
71693,If that's not what you want spend more.,71693,4
71694,Comfortable and easy to put on.,71694,4
71694,Very delicate so I had to recheck several times to make sure I was still wearing them!,71694,4

71697,Good basic t shirt!,71697,4

71701,It is really small BUT!!!,71701,4
71701,"It is stickers in nit a ""sticker"" type thing how it looks in the pic and there is no little tab with the ""logo"" on it ....it is really tight but it will stretch so ik glad it is fright bc it does stretch...I'm 5""2(if it helps and it futs me snug....it will stretch so don't be worried it is a great hay....I orders it sep 10th is and it can in 2-3weeks...it said it was going to come within a month but it came way earlier so don't be worried...great hat and good quality for a cheap hat",71701,4

71704,Really I didn't have an issue with them so I wouldn't tell someone not to buy it.,71704,4

71704,Overall a good product.,71704,4
71705,Love the dress very good in length fits good on myself and daughter.,71705,4
71705,I do however need some alterations done up top for both of us because top was a little to big.,71705,4
71705,Was still worth what we paid for dress.,71705,4
71706,It's a pretty and comfortable tank.,71706,4

71711,I would order another one for the price.,71711,4
71712,The glow skeleton sticks to itself and has peeled in small areas but overall it did the perfect job of a Halloween costume!,71712,4
71713,I purchased the Passion Pink.,71713,4
71713,"It is not as bright as displayed in the picture, but I do like it.",71713,4
71713,I purchased this to replace an old passport wallet.,71713,4
71713,"The one I replaced had a zipper, which was nice, but the zipper tab broke, and so it was almost impossible to zip up and zip closed.",71713,4
71713,"I like this one because you can pick a nice bright color, which I should be able to easily locate in my bag when traveling.",71713,4
71713,"It has some little pockets on the inside, which are nice.",71713,4
71713,I do not intend to place a credit card nor my driver's license in any of those pockets though.,71713,4
71713,I did place a copy of my birth certificate in one of the pockets.,71713,4
71713,"I know you do not need your birth certificate with your passport, but I have always carried it, and so I have placed the birth certificate in one of the pockets.",71713,4

71717,Well done on the quick delivery.,71717,4
71717,"It's an excellent quality, and I'm willing to wait for the odor to dissipate (not a bad odor, but noticeable).",71717,4
71717,"It's a bit heavier than my other small shoulder bags, but I'm pleased with how much room is on the inside.",71717,4
71717,"The reason I didn't give 5 stars is the lack of small inside pockets--for cell phone, keys, etc.--although I do like the security of the zippered top flap pocket.",71717,4
71718,"I love shoes with some height, but without much heel rise.",71718,4
71718,Was concerned about ordering these due to reviews about durability.,71718,4
71718,I find these fit somewhat narrow.,71718,4
71718,The 10 is great for my 10AA foot.,71718,4
71718,Maybe that's why people are breaking straps if they have M to W feet.,71718,4
71718,"Haven't worn them much, so will update if I find a durability problem.",71718,4
71718,"I was not a fan of the white sides, so decided to try making them black.",71718,4

71718,I put on 3 coats.,71718,4
71718,"As you can see in the pic with the marker, the first coat streaks.",71718,4
71718,I did 2 horizontal coats and 1vertical coat.,71718,4
71718,I really pushed hard on the marker to get the black in around the straps.,71718,4
71718,I had to shake the marker often and doodle on scrap paper to keep the ink flowing.,71718,4
71718,"Be aware that if you go over a spot before it is dry (1-2 mins), it will be sticky and streak worse.",71718,4
71718,I did not color the bottom of the shoes.,71718,4
71718,Have already gotten compliments about how great they look.,71718,4
71718,Project took about an hour.,71718,4
71718,"I also have these in tan, and am debating whether to make the sides brown or leave them white :-)",71718,4
71719,this is a nice lingerie set for a price.,71719,4
71719,"I normaly wear medium/large, I ordered this in large and it fits great!",71719,4
71719,"Material is better than I expected, but I would still only wear it occasionally for romantic nights, definitely wouldn't sleep in it.",71719,4
71719,"It survived washer and dryer just fine, but just to be sure Im planning to handwash it from now.",71719,4
71720,Perfect for water play,71720,4
71721,Great quality and fits great with room to grow,71721,4

71723,"otherwise it's a wonderful dress, very comfortable.",71723,4
71725,My Oakley lenses were scratched to hell after one too many drops.,71725,4
71725,These seemed well reviewed and pretty inexpensive compared to Oakley's replacement lenses so I gave them a shot.,71725,4
71725,These are great and they fit my frames perfectly.,71725,4
71725,The only minor annoyance was that many other replacement lens companies give you the $1 screwdriver for glasses repair.,71725,4
71725,"It would have saved me a trip to Walgreens if these guys did, as well.",71725,4
71727,I usually wear a 4/6 in womans but decided to buy a medium because of the other reviews.,71727,4
71727,It was a little big but the length was good.,71727,4
71727,"Overall, worked out great for the party.",71727,4
71728,It runs larger than described by other reviewers.,71728,4

71731,My daughter wore this to a Halloween party and she looked fantastic.,71731,4
71731,Lots of comments on how great of a costume it was.,71731,4
71731,Only thing we didn't care for were the foamy scissor hands.,71731,4
71731,cheapened the look of the costume.,71731,4
71732,Very attractive suit for plus-size ladies; the color blocking on the sides is very slimming.,71732,4
71732,I ordered a size 24 instead of my usual 22 and it fit great!,71732,4
71733,"I have gotten so many compliments on this bag, and have sent at least three people back to it's amazon page so that they can purchase it as well.",71733,4
71733,The only reason I gave it four stars is because the zippers on the inside are poorly made and the tabs have already fallen off after only having it for about six months.,71733,4
71733,"I only paid $20 for mine though, so taking that into consideration, I could probably give it five stars.",71733,4
71733,Another downfall is the back pocket is too small to fit my iPhone 6 in .,71733,4
71733,"again, not a major downer, but it would be nice to not have to open the main compartment of the bag just to reach my phone.",71733,4
71735,These pants are very cute.,71735,4
71735,"Thankfully, they do fit, and they are long enough, which is a problem I frequently have with pants.",71735,4

71735,"The material is nice and thick, but no stretch.",71735,4
71735,"I have trouble finding cargo pants that I like, so I am pleased with these overall.",71735,4
71736,"It resembles the shirt in the picture, although it does look like cheaper quality.",71736,4
71736,The patch is kinda generic looking and the quality of the shirt  is kinda thin.,71736,4
71736,"Overall, for the price it's not that bad.",71736,4
71737,So fun for Santa Con!,71737,4
71737,"I wear a L/XL normally and it fit very well - except for the belt, which was a joke.",71737,4
71737,So I used one of my own thick black belts...problem solved.,71737,4
71737,(Had to add a couple safety pins to keep it closed and it was still low cut/sexy.,71737,4
71737,I also wore black leggings or it would have been obscene!),71737,4
71737,I'm ready for next year's Santa Con already :),71737,4

71740,My husband loves them.,71740,4
71740,The flap is great for when you need to use the restroom and don't want to take the whole onesie off.,71740,4
71740,It's nice and soft too.,71740,4
71741,Pretty dress would have needed too many alterations for my frame.,71741,4
71742,I ordered an extra lg.,71742,4
71742,even though I'm a sz 10 & it was too small.,71742,4
71742,Hated to send it back :-(,71742,4
71743,Love the sweater - good construction - great color - had to reorder in a larger sizes because they are not true to size - I wear a xlarge and had to reorder in a 3x to have the sweater fit comfortably.,71743,4
71744,Fun top to wear,71744,4
71745,The dresses are really pretty.,71745,4
71745,"I ordered two a size smaller, because I read other reviews saying they run large.",71745,4

71746,"The back is criss crossing strings and I love it, bought my usual size and it fit perfect",71746,4
71747,"Seems good enough quality and unlike some reviews, it no longer stretches too easily, which is a problem since I have to stretch it a couple of inches and it's too tight.",71747,4
71748,The dress is lovely but the length was shorter than what's depicted.,71748,4
71748,I'm 5'11 and got a size 14 but it wasn't floor length.,71748,4
71749,"Good quality & stylish, but the fit runs smaller than expected.",71749,4
71749,"It still zips up, but only with a thin shirt underneath.",71749,4
71749,I would recommend buying the size up to be more comfy.,71749,4
71750,Very cute and high quality cotton.,71750,4
71750,Nicely padded and the Mickey designs are great.,71750,4

71756,When ordering online it's very hard to get what you want.,71756,4
71757,"Live in Key West Fl, love little sun dresses.",71757,4
71758,"its real cheap though not sure fabric will hold long at all, needs made thicker and better other than that ok.",71758,4
71759,The top of the sleeves are a little smaller than I expected but it still fits fine.,71759,4
71759,The lace has already started coming loose though,71759,4
71760,Very pretty and opened it the night before.,71760,4
71760,Wasn't wrinkled at all so didn't have to worry about steaming it or letting it sit,71760,4
71761,I was so excited for this swimsuit!,71761,4
71761,its unique and just what i was looking for!,71761,4
71761,"it even came faster than expected, I didn't expect it to get her for another couple weeks!",71761,4
71761,when i got the package and opened it up it's very high quality.,71761,4
71761,with the suit being white i was worried it might be see through but it was double lined ensuring no embarasing show through (i did not get it wet though so i am unsure of how it would be in water).,71761,4
71761,the riveting is very high quality to!,71761,4
71761,it looks like it would really hold up well.,71761,4

71761,while i had big plans for this suit i will unfortunately be returning (maybe returning it to replace with a larger size).,71761,4
71761,i was offered a discount on this product for an honest review.,71761,4
71761,**Edit** when i contacted the company to get a larger size they were reluctant to give me my money back but after speaking with them through email a bit they sent me the next size up.,71761,4
71761,i LOVE this suit!,71761,4
71761,"it is still a bit snug, but that is probably best for such a low cut suit.",71761,4
71761,"i am so happy that i could get a larger size and can now wear this suit out, it is definitely an attention getter and i have gotten several compliments on it so far!",71761,4
71762,"The stones were bigger then I thought it would be, but I like it.",71762,4
71762,Got a lot of compline nots at a wedding,71762,4
71764,Very nice and cute shirt for the price.,71764,4
71764,I recommend sizing up if you want it to fit loosely and flowy.,71764,4
71765,I must say that I love this piece I worn it for mother's day and the color I worn was a deep coral and this necklace just popped..I got soooooooo many compliments can't wait to were it again!,71765,4
71766,They don't slip that parts great they keep your cool it's also great they could just be a little longer so they can go below your gloves and not leave three intches ofskin for sunburn,71766,4
71767,Item took longer than expected so it will be a birthday gift as I couldn't give it for Christmas.,71767,4
71768,I got the large and it fit a bit snug.,71768,4
71768,I'm a size 5 in jeans.,71768,4
71768,But I love the way the underwear looks with my jeans and dresses.,71768,4
71769,Fast shipping but item changes color too quick.,71769,4
71771,The case is good quality and crafted well but the image is slightly blurry as if the second picture later was not lined up correctly.,71771,4
71771,Other than that I love the case!,71771,4
71773,"This is a typical white dress shirt, with the women's cut and styling.",71773,4
71773,"My daughter needed a shirt for her work uniform, and this would not accommodate a bowtie.",71773,4
71773,"Material is thin and white, but not much less quality than the lands end shirts we ended up keeping.",71773,4
71775,These rings are great but I wish they would make a slightly less domed design.,71775,4
71775,"The white tungsten finish is beautiful, more understated than cobalt chrome (but without a hint of the usual tungsten grey) and actually more resistant to scratching, to my shock.",71775,4
71775,"If you buy a ring like this that's wider than probably 5mm, you will want to add a half size to your regular ring size.",71775,4
71775,I normally wear a 7 but have a couple of widths of these in 7.5 for days when I'm retaining water.,71775,4
71775,That's the beauty of this metal -- you can have several widths and a couple of different sizes without spending a fortune.,71775,4
71775,Aside from the fact that this stuff doesn't scratch like either gold or silver or even stainless steel.,71775,4
71776,"Pricey, but definitely does what they are advertised to do.",71776,4
71776,Very light weight construction and would recommend you use the included hard case to transport.,71776,4
71777,"I really like this top, I love unicorns and the print is nice for this top.",71777,4
71777,"Its not a TRUE sweater, but more of a long sleeved shirt.",71777,4
71777,"It does run small, I ordered an XL and it fit like a Medium.",71777,4
71777,"Im not a really big lady, a 36 B cup about 5'2 120 lbs.",71777,4
71777,"So watch the sizing, if you're much bigger than that it will be very FITTED!.",71777,4
71778,"Very nice, it's soft on my baby's hands and stay on.",71778,4
71778,That's the most important thing.,71778,4
71778,The straps keep them on unlike others that eventually fall off.,71778,4
71778,I would have given 5 stars but the only problem for me is that my 6 week old baby's fingers are long so his hands are to big for these mittens.,71778,4
71778,I wish there were size options,71778,4
71779,Great value for the price.,71779,4
71780,"These were a little longer than some of the Carter's 18 month sleepers we've purchased for our son, but I didn't mind overly much as it's a lightweight sleeper and he'll be able to grow into it before too long.",71780,4
71781,Really nice and chic pants.,71781,4
71781,Elastic easy in and out occasionally gliding from the bum area.,71781,4
71781,Over all I like them nice buy for the maternity wardrobe.,71781,4
71781,4 stars vs. 5 only because I really miss pats with zipper :'(,71781,4
71782,Haven't worn it yet but tried on and it fits great.,71782,4
71783,Most of the reviews scared me into almost cancelling my order.,71783,4
71783,"I'm 6'1'' and curvy, ordered an XL.",71783,4
71783,Other than being slightly short in the length which I would still pull off wearing heels with them.,71783,4
71783,"Since its summer, I pulled them up a little as capris.",71783,4
71783,"It's snug with size 38Ds, but still comfy and breathable, not see-through either.",71783,4
71783,"I was really afraid it wasn't going to fit at all, but I'm glad my cancellation request didn't go through.",71783,4
71783,Now I have a cute outfit to wear to my bachelorette party in a couple weeks!,71783,4
71787,It is kinda made cheaply.,71787,4
71787,It broke the first time I wore it.,71787,4
71787,"I was able to fix it, but am a little disappointed with the quality.",71787,4
71787,Looks nice though...added a pic of the bracelet with (with another one I own).,71787,4
71788,This bag has a nice quality feel and look.,71788,4
71788,"However, it was described as ""small"" and I definitely do not feel it is a ""small"" bag.",71788,4
71788,"I would describe it as ""medium"".",71788,4
71790,I love this necklace and get tons of complements whenever I wear it!,71790,4
71792,First Id like to start by saying that this company has great customer service.,71792,4
71792,"Second are, they are quick to fix any mistakes made.",71792,4
71792,"That being said, when I ordered this dress I had looked threw so many under dresses/slip and came to this one.",71792,4
71792,"PROS:
The dress is really soft
Came quickly
And the 1 size fits all doesn't squish me like a lot of them do.",71792,4
71792,"Now to the CONS:
  When I ordered I received a ""tank top"" version of this dress.",71792,4
71792,"They sent me another and again got the ""tank top"" dress.",71792,4
71792,But third time's a charm and I got the right one.,71792,4
71792,"Due to the fact that it wasn't the company, but distributer that was the proble..
.",71792,4
71792,"and due to the fact that the woman I spoke to/emailed made sure to keep trying to get me my dress and let me keep the other two free of charge, I would say fantastic customer service!",71792,4
71792,And nice soft product.,71792,4
71792,I'll update  with photos when I wear it.,71792,4
71793,Good quality and a good fit.,71793,4
71793,"It is not a fitted cap It's a one size fits all type, but not with the funky adjustable strap in the back.",71793,4
71793,More like a built in stretch band which makes it appear to be a fitted cap.,71793,4
71793,I like that look better.,71793,4
71794,I really like this.,71794,4
71794,It's long enough to wear tights and it cover the back AND the front.,71794,4
71794,It's a little tight on my arms and tummy but other than that I love it,71794,4
71795,it was what i was looking for,71795,4
71796,I am 5'8 at 160 on average.,71796,4
71796,They did go above my knees and look appealing with the workout gear I wore but wish they were just a little higher.,71796,4
71797,Got here faster than expected.,71797,4
71797,The only thing is the colors are more of a red-pink with chocolate than a light Brown with chocolate.,71797,4
71797,It's short in length.,71797,4
71797,It could use the little strip belt but doesn't come with it.,71797,4
71797,"In all, very cute",71797,4
71798,"Fit well, but if you are wearing a button down shirt with no under shirt it will be seen, and if you go to a club or something where you can see white clothes light up it will be seen there as well.",71798,4
71798,Good though definitely can feel the snug.,71798,4
71799,Expected/Actual Arrival: Nov. 10.,71799,4
71799,"2015
Size Ordered/Got: Large
Pant Size: 9/10
I have had two pairs of these(One Rose and One Light Blue)  for a few months and these are really comfortable to wear.",71799,4
71799,They fit nicely and I love them.,71799,4
71799,"The downsides are that they don't stay up, they constantly fall down.",71799,4
71799,"Also after a few washes and wears, the seams where the pockets are sewn started to come undone, as seen in the pictures.",71799,4
71799,With The rose ones it got caught on something in the wash and tore the accent stitching that was across the butt (I was at fault on that one).,71799,4
71799,Although with the downsides I would get a few more because they're that comfortable.,71799,4
71799,(Sorry if images are unclear or sideways.),71799,4
71800,Would buy the next size up from normally worn size because it runs a bit small.,71800,4
71800,I was looking for a high black v neck tee and this fit the bill/,71800,4
71801,Bought two for gifts and they didn't stop talking about it!,71801,4
71801,I scored on the gift giving this year.,71801,4
71801,Difficult to figure  out all the functions but that made it fun.,71801,4
71801,Good price and nice looking with all the gadgets.,71801,4
71801,Band is a little cheap looking but functional.,71801,4
71802,It was perfect on my daughter.,71802,4
71802,She is a size 4 and we ordered a small for her.,71802,4
71802,My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I had to cut several loose threads from the shorts.,71802,4
71803,The shades are cool they're just crooked when you put them on...I guess I have to bend them when I wear them,71803,4
71804,I was wearing this while playing payday 2 for fun reaction and my brother freaked out.,71804,4
71804,I responded Im in the middle of a heist in the game and he replied you need Jesus and I laughed.,71804,4
71804,And explained I'm f /ing around.,71804,4
71804,Hard to see through but fun for a prank.,71804,4
71804,Just be careful what the prank is....,71804,4
71805,I'm happy about this shirt although it is kind of thin and it shrank a little bit in the dryer.,71805,4
71806,The fit is perfect.,71806,4
71806,"I am just a little worried that the fabric might pill, however, I am being extremely careful with it.",71806,4
71807,I received the bracelet in the mail much earlier than expected but it was the wrong bracelet.,71807,4
71807,Thankfully I don't mind because the one I received was second on my list of the ones I wanted to buy.,71807,4
71807,"Instead of the butterfly one, I got the round faced watch with a leaf.",71807,4
71807,Very pretty and I will wear it often.,71807,4
71808,Got a lot of compliments.,71808,4
71809,Make sure you don't dry it all the way as it is prone to shrink.,71809,4
71810,This bathrobe is exactly what I wanted in terms of fit and comfort.,71810,4
71810,"On cold nights in the Pacific Northwest, this robe is oh so warm and goes all the way to my ankles.",71810,4
71810,The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the dye job.,71810,4
71810,"The color does not look like the burgundy in the picture at all, but rather like some faded pastel version of it.",71810,4
71810,"But I bought it for warmth, not appearance, so I will keep it.",71810,4
71811,Love the feel but like most of the other reviews I wish the torso was a bit longer.,71811,4
71811,I ordered cautiously and should have ordered a size smaller.,71811,4
71811,I will be ordering another one in a smaller size.,71811,4
71812,"for a $4 watch, this thing kept ticking up until it fell 10 feet and the face cracked.",71812,4
71812,was definitely worth the money.,71812,4
71813,"Fit well, wash well.",71813,4
71813,"My daughter uses these as an undergarment for sports, and if she's willing to use them they must be good.",71813,4
71813,This was also a great price for this product compared to some of the brand names out there.,71813,4
71813,Performs well on all counts.,71813,4
71814,Came in on time & in good condition.,71814,4
71814,Bought this for my 4th grader who said the thick straps are comfortable.,71814,4
71814,She puts a big binder and several books in it at once (because she really enjoys reading) & the bag fits all of it.,71814,4
71814,The only issue is the zipper pulls weren't very well attached & came off right away after one day.,71814,4
71814,We tied ribbons on the zippers instead & it seems to be holding up & allowing her to use the zippers with no problem now.,71814,4
71814,The little pouch is a nice add on.,71814,4
71814,Love the cute pattern & the color online is the color in real life which is nice.,71814,4
71814,All together it was a pretty good buy with a decent price :),71814,4
71815,"I wish I had realized this was in UK sizing, it fits, but with a bit more coverage than I was looking for.",71815,4
71815,It fits like a full coverage bra vs a balconet style.,71815,4
71815,My only actual complaint is the width of the underwires.,71815,4
71815,I ordered the 34j (which according to the tag is a US 34m (a fact I find a bit scary since I usually wear a US 34j and I actually fill out the cups in this suit)...) and the underwires feel like they come almost all the way around to my back.,71815,4
71815,"This is causing the wire to rock a bit against my rib cage since they are wider than my ribs are and poke me in the armpit, because they come up so high (I also have this issue with some bras).",71815,4
71815,Not sure if a smaller cup size would solve this issue or not.,71815,4
71815,A sizing chart with the conversion sizes or a notation that the sizing us UK vs US would be helpful.,71815,4
71815,The fabric is lovely and the print is super vibrant.,71815,4
71815,"I will be keeping it since I need a top for Monday and will most likely order again in the future, just a smaller size.",71815,4
71816,"Light weight, quick drying and good looking, just wish they had a mesh insert for better stability for your private parts",71816,4
71817,"The only reason I gave it four stars is because it came with a broken strap and had THEE WORST stinch upon opening, however both were an easy fix!",71817,4
71817,I purchased this two-peice for my Miami vacation and it was a hit.,71817,4
71817,"I'm 5'4"", barley an A, 131lbs, hips and a  lot of booty for my size.",71817,4
71817,"I'm what you'd call ""slim thick"".",71817,4
71817,The bra was a tad too big but it didn't bother me.,71817,4
71818,Only thing is its a little open on the forehead.,71818,4
71818,Ok if you have goggles i guess.,71818,4
71819,Go by what the other reviews say; by at least a size down because I order baby size and they fit my 3 1/2 year old's hands well.,71819,4
71819,They kept his hands dry and warm while playing in the snow.,71819,4
71820,The quality seems very well made and it's nice and toasty warm.,71820,4
71820,But the sleeves are a little to tight and short.,71820,4
71820,"I'm 5'9"" and the sleeves are an inch to short.",71820,4
71820,But I'd definitely recommend this!,71820,4
71821,"Easy breezy material, perfect for summer.",71821,4
71821,It's a bit see through so wear a slip with  dark colored underwear.,71821,4
71821,I put a safety pin at about knee height because otherwise everything is on show .,71821,4
71821,Otherwise it's gorgeous and I receive compliments on it all the time.,71821,4
71821,And it shrinks in the wash so be sure to iron it out before you wear it.,71821,4
71822,"This is a nice hoodie but I thought the material would be thicker and warmer, it wasn't.",71822,4
71822,However my granddaughter loves the teal color and begged to keep it.,71822,4
71823,These ring are nice and a good value.,71823,4
71823,I have had trouble with the angry piercing bump so I had to retire these for a better metal.,71823,4
71823,They are also a pain to put in.,71823,4
71823,It takes patience and practice!,71823,4
71824,All I hoped for.,71824,4
71825,"As expected, showed up early",71825,4
71827,"Very sturdy, does not bend like a metal clip would, it's a little large, but that's my fault for paying closer attention to the details.",71827,4
71827,Over all a nice clip.,71827,4
71828,These are for my elderly father.,71828,4
71828,He's used coin purses all his life (80's now).,71828,4
71829,This dress is beautiful!,71829,4
71829,However the only negative part is that I have to wear a white tank top underneath it because it's very see through.,71829,4
71829,This is a great elegant dress and fits me perfectly.,71829,4
71829,"I am 5'10"" and am 8-10 in US sizes.",71829,4
71829,This dress reaches to my mid thigh.,71829,4
71829,It's a great quality and great for many occasions.,71829,4
71830,These stone plugs are very beautiful and well made.,71830,4
71830,The groove that the spacer fits on is perfect as well.,71830,4
71830,I only wish that the plugs weren't so long.,71830,4
71830,Their length will surely extend well past most people's earlobes.,71830,4
71832,This shirt is awesome!,71832,4
71832,"I saw one similar to it on Facebook and I had to buy it for a friend, whose favorite show of all time is Friends.",71832,4
71832,"The shirt looks and fits really good, however, the sewing on one of the sleeves is coming apart after only two or three wears.",71832,4
71833,One of my favorite pairs of pants!,71833,4
71833,Fit according to measurements listed.,71833,4
71833,"The fabric is thin and wrinkles easily, and in general, the pants are not the highest quality around, but for the price and how cute they are, I don't care!",71833,4
71834,I'm 5'1 and they went all the way to my butt and were just a little loose but very sexy i like the grip on top so they don't fall.,71834,4
71834,no rips or tears,71834,4
71835,They fit well and look good.,71835,4
71835,I plan to buy more.,71835,4
71836,Too big for my small head but cute simple baseball cap for girls.,71836,4
71837,I get a lot of compliments on this top.,71837,4
71837,I like the flow to the material and the way it fits on me.,71837,4
71837,I wear a size 14 and have an hourglass shape and this fits great.,71837,4
71837,I imagine it would fit almost any size from 2-18 depending on how you want it to hang and drape and what body shape you have.,71837,4
71837,Larger sizes like myself might be tight around the hips if you have a pear shape.,71837,4
71837,My only complaint is the first time I washed it the seem came undone on one shoulder which I repaired myself and haven't had any problems since.,71837,4
71838,Very pretty and fits very comfortable!,71838,4
71838,In some places I think the thread could be a little more hidden but over all very nice.,71838,4
71839,Good quality but the waist band should have been stretchy.,71839,4
71839,It was uncomfortably unforgiving in the way it was stitched.,71839,4
71839,Very very difficult to step into and wiggle past the hips or even go the other way and wiggle on over the shoulders.,71839,4
71839,Once past that point the product fit really well.,71839,4
71839,It was just very strange to have a design like that.,71839,4
71839,I ordered a small and the product fit very well...once completely on... with plenty of room under it to wear a layer to keep warm outside in the costume.,71839,4
71839,It held up for washing it and wearing it 3 times.,71839,4
71840,Ordered taupe and got gray.,71840,4
71840,Sleeves really long but easy to roll up.,71840,4
71842,It's a makeup bag.,71842,4
71842,Not shoes like Amazon thinks.,71842,4
71842,"It holds a lot of my wife's ""war paint"" and she likes it.",71842,4
71842,Not much to say about a plastic makeup bag.,71842,4
71843,Color darker than expected.,71843,4
71844,"My guys likes them, but says they are a little tight at the top so he has to slightly push them down.",71844,4
71845,"M/L a tight, smoothing fit and easy on the waist elastic.",71845,4
71845,"Ample stretch and not a struggle to get off and on in bathroom, etc.",71845,4
71845,"Crotch well seamed for comfort, no cleaving.",71845,4
71845,"My only wish is that they felt warmer under slacks when strolling in wintery conditions, but they do provide a degree of insulation.",71845,4
71845,After one wearing I heartily recommend.,71845,4
71845,"We'll see how they launder and wear..,",71845,4
71846,"Great value, quality in line with the price.",71846,4
71846,Washing reduced more than expected.,71846,4
71847,"While busty women must be careful (these high neck dresses can smash 'em down), this dress is actually cut really well and made of excellent fabric, like a light crisp cotton.",71847,4
71847,The fabric-colored belt matches perfectly and actually looked great.,71847,4
71847,"I liked this dress a lot and would recommend if you're interested, especially for the great price.",71847,4
71848,"Great material, looks awesome!",71848,4
71848,Only issue I had was the buttons attaching the hood to the jacket fell off and I had to sew them back on.,71848,4
71849,I am very pleased with this product.,71849,4
71849,Firstly is is exactly as it is shown in the picture.,71849,4
71849,I purchased it in gray and am certainly not disappointed.,71849,4
71849,My son is 10 months and based on the chart I purchased size 12-18 months which fit him perfectly.,71849,4
71849,It looked elegant and neat since it's one piece rather than couple of different pieces which end up everywhere giving your toddler a messy look.,71849,4
71849,Lastly the material is nice and soft and comfortable.,71849,4
71850,"A little large but won't be using it until our vacation, swimming in ocean will get to test it then under rash guard.",71850,4
71850,Looks very well made.,71850,4
71851,the bill on the cap is a bit long - as babies want to look up but the back is perfect,71851,4
71852,This is a gift I will be giving.,71852,4
71852,It looks substantial and well made.,71852,4
71852,I didn't give it 5 stars because I noticed a few beads seem to be fused together but overeall it is very pretty and should go with any color.,71852,4
71853,I call this a long shirt but I can see how others could call this a dress.,71853,4
71853,I really love the look of it!!,71853,4
71853,It's just a little snug so I'm going to exchange it for an xl.,71853,4
71853,"I'm 5'3"" and 160 lbs.",71853,4
71853,I just had a baby so I do have a flabby belly.,71853,4
71853,I like the length and the look just need the right size :-),71853,4
71854,It is a very cute and we'll made set but do not buy if you have a chest bigger than a C cup,71854,4
71855,Fits on first try & warm,71855,4
71856,Very cute so I kept the top but it was too big.,71856,4
71857,"Fit is good (stretches),comfortable fabric, I had ordered different colors.",71857,4
71857,Less quality than my Calvins - but those cost me $25 each - but not that much less quality.,71857,4
71857,If buy them again if it had different pattern waist.,71857,4
71858,I loved it but I woke up one morning and it's body went missing.,71858,4
71858,Now I have a decapitated head on my belly button.,71858,4
71858,I'm a little heart broken but I might buy another cause I really loved it.,71858,4
71859,It's lightweight and a great color,71859,4
71860,"I like the color and shape of this top, but the fit is smaller than other tops from this brand.",71860,4
71861,"The fabric is very sheer, but we expected that.",71861,4
71863,My son loves the look.,71863,4
71863,They seem to be holding up ok so far.,71863,4
71864,I ordered a large.,71864,4
71864,"I am 32 DD and 27"" waist",71864,4
71865,I like it but had loose strings coming out.,71865,4
71865,But it is nice for the pice.,71865,4
71866,This purse is cute.,71866,4
71866,"It has the chains, which I love.",71866,4
71866,The wallet doesn't match though.,71866,4
71866,The purse is black and blue whereas the wallet is brown.,71866,4
71866,It works but doesn't match.,71866,4
71866,The purse is a bit small for all my stuff but it keeps me from weighing it down with too much.,71866,4
71866,Overall it is a great buy.,71866,4
71867,I love these sunglasses.,71867,4
71867,Super lightweight and the gradient is nice on the lenses.,71867,4
71867,My only complaint is that I wished they had a polarized version for this model.,71867,4
71868,This dress/tunic is gorgeous.,71868,4
71868,I bought it for a casual night out.,71868,4
71868,It is a little dressier than expected.,71868,4
71868,I can't wait to wear out.,71868,4
71869,I bought these socks to wear at work for our theme sock day.,71869,4
71869,I wear a women's size 9.5 shoe size for reference.,71869,4
71869,"Reason for 4 stars is while I liked them and thought they looked good, they kept falling down off my my shin and bunching up around the ankles so the design was hard to make out unless I pulled the socks back up.",71869,4
71869,"After having to do that several times, it got to be annoying so makes it hard for me to want to wear these to work all day again.",71869,4
71869,I wear boots at work so its nice to have socks that cover pass one's ankles just wished I didn't have to keep pulling them up.,71869,4
71869,"Pros:
Pattern looks great even stretched
Wash up well (cold water, hang dry)

Cons:
Socks are thin, similar to the thickness of a dress sock.",71869,4
71869,"Easy to snag, and in fact my nails got caught on it when putting them on the first time.",71869,4
71869,Socks kept falling down towards my ankles and had to keep pulling them up every so often as it was annoying when I was wearing boots.,71869,4
71870,They are exactly what I need for my flat feet.,71870,4
71871,They go nicely with a necklace I had purchased.,71871,4
71872,I LOVE THEM !,71872,4
71872,It's a really good buy at a really good price.,71872,4
71872,Luckily I ordered a size up because they do run a little small.,71872,4
71872,"I'm a 32C, but decided on the 34C.",71872,4
71872,So I reccomend you order a size up.,71872,4
71873,However the tip isn't as hard as I'd hoped and they are kind of hard to put on no matter how much we loosen them up.,71873,4
71873,But still my son loves them!,71873,4
71873,I love them because the color is so shiny and bright I can always tell where he is on the field!,71873,4
71873,Hahahaha they are beautiful cleets.,71873,4
71873,We got the blue one.,71873,4
71874,I wish the top was bigger because it was a LITTLE bit smaller than I wanted it to be for my comfort.,71874,4
71874,I actually had to take out the padding that was included because it is WAY too small.,71874,4
71874,"It honestly just looked weird, it was like a D cup bra with A cup padding.",71874,4
71874,"Instead, I had to wear a bra under for support but I didn't mind because the straps aren't noticeable with this style bathing suit.",71874,4
71874,"It's well made and hella cute, I received ton of compliments!",71874,4
71875,"I like this dress, although I had to order a second dress when the first was too small.",71875,4
71875,Great dress for my daughter's homecoming dance.,71875,4
71876,I wanted this Lana shirt as a bathing suit cover shirt.,71876,4
71876,Material is very see through but good for what I wanted it for would need an undershirt if wearing as a regular shirt.,71876,4
71876,This is a polyester shirt not cotton still light weight and breathable.,71876,4
71876,Design and colors are vibrant.,71876,4
71876,Shipped fast good buy for price.,71876,4
71877,I bought these crocs for my Husband and he loves them .We  live on a farm and he wears them to do his chores .Very  comfortable.,71877,4
71878,In person it's more of a purple blue than a true dark blue.,71878,4
71879,"Took a long time to get here, but overal they look awesome !",71879,4
71880,They are kinda see through.,71880,4
71881,The pendant itself is gorgeous - rainbow cabochon with just enough iridescence to make it look like a real Mega Stone.,71881,4
71881,The chain that came with is of a poorer quality - the black finish started chipping off the moment I first went to put it on.,71881,4
71881,"After about a week of constant wear, half the finish is gone.",71881,4
71881,"It's more of an annoyance than anything, though I plan to ditch the necklace and make it into some other kind of jewelry.",71881,4
71882,"Don't know how warm they are--yet, but should know after this weekend.",71882,4
71882,The s/m is the right fit.,71882,4
71883,Our family is a huge fan of Sketchers shoes.,71883,4
71883,When purchasing this brand be aware that you should select a half size up from what you normally wear.,71883,4
71883,"I have a pair of Sketchers from two years ago and they are still in tact and comfortable, even though I use them daily.",71883,4
71884,very comfortable even in the hot summer,71884,4
71885,I really enjoy the quality of the sweater but it runs very small,71885,4
71886,Fyi - I am NOT one of those paid to post people.,71886,4
71886,I bought these because I wanted some cheap (but polarized) sunglasses for being outside in the summer.,71886,4
71886,Polarized is a must for me as I like how they cut the glare.,71886,4
71886,But I also don't like to spend a lot on sunglasses for being by the pool or cutting the grass bc I'm likely to mess them up.,71886,4
71886,These are exactly what I was looking for - inexpensive polarized lenses.,71886,4
71886,The metal of the frames is very light - probably pretty susceptible to being broken or smooshed but the glasses wholly lived up to my expectations.,71886,4
71886,They sit lightly on my face.,71886,4
71886,I'd say lens color appears pretty much as advertised and I checked them against another pair of polarized lenses - they are indeed polarized.,71886,4
71886,"All-in-all, it's a good purchase if you're seeking a decent looking inexpensive pair of polarized sunglasses.",71886,4
71886,I went 4 stars instead of 5 because they are what I expected and what I was looking for but didn't knock my socks off in any special way.,71886,4
71886,I reserve my 5's for things I really love.,71886,4
71887,The buckle is plastic but besides that I like the belt.,71887,4
71887,The company got this product to me FAST.,71887,4
71888,Got this in a large.,71888,4
71888,"Fits ok, but the material is thins.",71888,4
71888,Not what I had expected.,71888,4
71888,But for the price it will work for the costume I'm putting together.,71888,4
71889,Although they run a little small I really like them and I received a lot of compliments on them.,71889,4
71890,"I gave this as a gift to my step-mother, and the only issue is that her wrist is very small and this isn't too malleable.",71890,4
71890,"Still, the design is strong, and it's a useful product.",71890,4
71890,Just know your wrist size!,71890,4
71891,"runs a ilttle smal, will have to have it resized to fit the finger it was intended for",71891,4
71892,Outstanding color and style.,71892,4
71892,Very happy with this product.,71892,4
71894,Fit was tight for 3yr old boys block feet,71894,4
71895,"The cut runs pretty small across the chest, despite how it may appear, and the material is a little more flimsy than I would like, BUT it's the perfect Agent Carter dress!",71895,4
71895,"It's the sort of dress Peggy Carter or Lois Lane would wear, the sort that makes you feel like you can take on the world, just you and your lipstick!",71895,4
71896,"It is looser than it looks in the picture, but for the price it was kind of expected it might be a hit or miss!",71896,4
71896,Something you could wear to Vegas or on NYE.,71896,4
71897,Ordered a size bigger and it fits great.wish the bow could be remove able.,71897,4
71898,"These are overall, not bad.",71898,4
71898,I got them for my wife.,71898,4
71898,First off - don't expect them to stay on like they are pierced nipples.,71898,4
71898,"The likely won't, especially if you're moving around a lot.",71898,4
71898,"My wife doesn't have huge nipples, but they also aren't small.",71898,4
71898,Something to note: they will flex a lot.,71898,4
71898,"You could bend them into whatever shape you want really, so I'm not sure why people are having trouble with them.",71898,4
71898,Getting them to stay takes a lot of pressure bending them inward but once you get the right pressure they stay really well.,71898,4
71898,"If you think that pressure might hurt (I'm gold it doesn't), then these might not be for you.",71898,4
71898,"Lastly, once they are in place, I use my mouth to help her nipples get to the right size and viola - they are stuck and we get on with it.",71898,4
71898,These are very nice looking.,71898,4
71898,Really elegant and enhances her already gorgeous berets and nipples.,71898,4
71899,Fit a little small but really darling.,71899,4
71899,Will be sizing up next time.,71899,4
71900,"I loved it ,  i can't wait to wear it outside",71900,4
71901,"I like that it stands out, nice material,cup holders are nice too",71901,4
71902,"Beautiful necklace, but the layers are not all in line, the beads are slightly off to the side.",71902,4
71902,"But for the price, I won't complain.",71902,4
71905,This product is awesome for wearing under shin guards.,71905,4
71905,Wouldn't go without them,71905,4
71906,Kinda cheap looking but for the price it's really nice,71906,4
71907,"Nice shirt, just a bit small for a size large.",71907,4
71908,"I ordered the black/gray/pink headbands and really like the stretchiness, fabric, and size.",71908,4
71908,I folded mine over so that it's not too wide and it works well.,71908,4
71908,"I would have given it five stars, but it doesn't work very well when I wear my glasses.",71908,4
71908,"I put on the headband first, but when I put my glasses on, it made it too tight in front of my ear and I had to push the headband back further on my hair, not closer to my face at my hairline where I wanted to wear the headband.",71908,4
71908,"Because it was further back, the headband did slip back eventually by the end of my workout - but it worked much better than other headbands I've tried.",71908,4
71908,"If I had been able to wear it at my hairline, I'm sure it would have stayed put just fine.",71908,4
71908,"So if you wear glasses when you work out, just be aware that you may have to adjust where headband rests on your head.",71908,4
71908,It's not really the fault of this particular headband - probably any headband would so the same thing.,71908,4
71909,I love that your ID is inside the zipper area but shows thru the window and is separate from the main area where I put my money and credit cards.,71909,4
71909,It fits perfectly in the small cross body handbag I purchased at a Vera Bradley store.,71909,4
71909,The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is  because I could have purchase it for half the price as this is a discontinued color/pattern but I needed it in a hurry and the store would have taken longer to ship.,71909,4
71910,"A little big, I had to make an extra hole, size 30 waist.",71910,4
71911,Nice dress but es muy transparente...,71911,4
71912,It fit my daughter very well.,71912,4
71912,The bottoms have nice coverage.,71912,4
71913,"Because of the mass amount of people saying how small it was, I decided to order a large just to be safe.",71913,4
71913,"I'm 5 ft 3 and 110 pounds with a 32 C chest size just for reference, and I can usually fit fine into a small.",71913,4
71913,"The large fit me in the chest nicely, not super baggy or tight.",71913,4
71913,"The skirt rested a little too low on my hips for my aesthetic, but a simple bobby pin was able to tighten the waist and make it more flattering :)
The material is okay, it's definitely not the greatest but it gets the job done and not too cheap.",71913,4
71913,"And just to warn others the basics of how to order this without being disappointed:
ORDER A SIZE BIGGER THAN YOU THINK!!",71913,4
71913,"The sizing is pretty small, be careful!",71913,4
71913,THIS IS NOT STRETCHY AT ALL!!,71913,4
71913,TOO BIG IS BETTER THAN TOO SMALL!,71913,4
71913,You can always go to a local seamstress to get it properly fit!,71913,4
71915,I love how this top fits me.,71915,4
71915,"I'm 5'7"" tall and the sleeves came to my wrist and the longest part in the back hit right above my knees so 5-star there.",71915,4
71915,Material is very thin and that is exactly what I was looking for with an intention of wearing it with a sleeveless underneath.,71915,4
71915,Color is better than I expected.,71915,4
71915,"Looking at the photos, I thought it'll be like a knit jersey material but now I see that the description says ""100% Acrylic"".",71915,4
71915,The material itself is soft but it feels itchy on my neck and arms.,71915,4
71915,Totally my fault for not reading through the description before making the purchase.,71915,4
71915,"I thought about returning this top but decided to keep because I like the style, sizing and the color.",71915,4
71915,"I'll be wearing it with a long sleeve underneath and hoping with few washes, itchiness will fade away.",71915,4
71918,Fits well and comfortable!,71918,4
71919,Received this dress way sooner than I expected and it was just as I imagined it.,71919,4
71919,The wonderful people at Olivia's Bridal were also kind enough to recommend a petticoat and matching veil which I hadn't considered.,71919,4
71919,Plus they shipped everything together way sooner.,71919,4
71920,Very nice cock pouch panties.,71920,4
71920,A little small /tight but not bad.,71920,4
71920,Don't know if a larger size gives your members more room but again pretty nice fit,71920,4
71921,Doesn't fit me as I would have hoped.,71921,4
71921,the 'skirt' portion doesn't reach the floor.,71921,4
71921,I am 5'9 and I bought an extra large.,71921,4
71921,Dress is a little thin though.,71921,4
71922,It works for autumn and winter (if it is not raining strong).,71922,4
71922,It fits perfect and it has a lot of nice pockets.,71922,4
71922,You can use it formal and informally and casual.,71922,4
71922,I just love it.,71922,4
71923,fits a little bigger than expected for the kids.,71923,4
71923,"Great water shoes for the park, water parks, camping or showers.",71923,4
71923,Shoes are well put together and does not tear easy especially when it comes to the soles.,71923,4
71924,There super cute and comfy but they are too small for the actual size it says,71924,4
71926,"This for a very small wrist, but it's very pretty and made a lovely gift for a friend.",71926,4
71927,"Its nice and mostly looks like the picture, just not on me.",71927,4
71927,I expected it to look sexier than it was which is why I only gave it four stars.,71927,4
71927,However I think for a girl who's not as flat chested as me it would look exactly like it's supposed to.,71927,4
71929,I really like these boots.,71929,4
71929,Fit as most Bear Paws do.,71929,4
71929,I found one foot to be a little more snug around the ankle then the other.,71929,4
71929,"Otherwise, same great quality as always!",71929,4
71930,Gave as a gift.,71930,4
71931,"I like them, but they were a tad large",71931,4
71932,The cord used to make this bracelet is the cheap elastic stuff.,71932,4
71932,"That being said, I love the beads.",71932,4
71932,"They are soft, smooth, and beautiful.",71932,4
71932,I definitely love using these as prayer beads.,71932,4
71932,I won't mind having to change the cord eventually.,71932,4
71933,It has quite a bit of spandex in it.,71933,4
71933,Nice item for leggings.,71933,4
71935,"Love it, but fits more like a shirt... Material isn't great but for the price it's not bad.",71935,4
71935,I do like it but it is a slightly awkward length.,71935,4
71936,"Nice, but quality is not very good.",71936,4
71938,"Nice heavy, big watch.",71938,4
71938,Digital display is bright and readable.,71938,4
71938,"It is simply a watch with two time zones (analog and digital), day, date and alarm but it looks and feels great.",71938,4
71938,Would like a stop watch but it is a good buy.,71938,4
71940,I purchased these boots for my daughter for a Christmas gift.,71940,4
71940,"They are a good fit, unfortunately they are not being made any longer or I'd buy another pair for back up.",71940,4
71940,Super cute and she's received a lot of compliments on them.,71940,4
71943,The shoes feel great.,71943,4
71943,They fit slightly large but I can already feel the difference when I walk in them.,71943,4
71943,Style is as shown.,71943,4
71944,great boots for the price and my granddaughter loved them,71944,4
71945,My daughter wears these to ballet class and loves them.,71945,4
71945,She is a very slim 8 year old and I can't imagine a girl much older being able to wear them - they are.,71945,4
71945,It very long but she wears them more for fashion than function.,71945,4
71945,I will probably get a heavier bigger pair to wear over leggings and for warmth,71945,4
71946,"A good, solid case.",71946,4
71946,It will be a good replacement for some older ones I still use,71946,4
71947,I am not sure how it fits.,71947,4
71947,I have not wore it yet.,71947,4
71947,It's very soft and looks like the pictures.,71947,4
71947,I hope it fits!,71947,4
71948,I have terrible palm eczema.,71948,4
71948,I have been able to get rid of it everywhere except where my Palm touches my mouse.,71948,4
71948,I bought these to wear at work to put a barrier between my palm and the mouse.,71948,4
71948,These are the perfect size and seem to be fairly well made.,71948,4
71949,"The pendant was a lot larger than I expected, but I'm not complaining.",71949,4
71949,"Very well made, and great over all necklace.",71949,4
71949,"It's heavy, and the chain is sturdy enough to hold it.",71949,4
71949,Was a great gift idea!,71949,4
71951,"Great soft, thinner cotton material.",71951,4
71951,I was a little concerned at first that the astronaut patch would be itchy underneath on my son's chest but it doesn't seem to bother him.,71951,4
71951,Fit is a bit snug.,71951,4
71952,Really pleased with this hood ... very comfortable ... and definitely works well.,71952,4
71953,It is a little too small but I like it,71953,4
71954,"It's very vivid, and very comfortable for casual day wear.",71954,4
71954,"Well made, for the price!",71954,4
71955,"I liked it,loved the bright color!",71955,4
71958,But a size bigger than your child wears.,71958,4
71958,They run small and are a little difficult to get onto foot.,71958,4
71958,Good for the price however.,71958,4
71960,Pretty..looks more elegant in the pic.,71960,4
71960,But it's sweet and for the price a nice little long necklace to dress up a casual outfit.,71960,4
71961,This bracelet is very pretty and looks just like the Pandora ones with out breaking your pocket so far so good the only FYI this bracelet is made for people with small wrist I got mine in 7.0 inches and to me it worked great because I have very small wrists.,71961,4
71961,Another thing I love is that is stainless steel which you can't go wrong,71961,4
71962,"I am 5'8"", 185 lbs, 38D, and usually wear size xl tops (Chico's 3) and size 14-16 bathing suits.",71962,4
71962,"I purchased this suit in 6xl, and after a few modifications, it fits well.",71962,4
71962,"The first thing I did was to open the cup lining and remove the rock hard, almost 1/2"" thick pads.",71962,4
71962,To do this I had to cut all around the cup seam as the pads were sewn in.,71962,4
71962,Then I cut along the casing for the underwire and removed it also.,71962,4
71962,"For me, the wires were misplaced and were very uncomfortable.",71962,4
71962,Why did I go through all of this trouble?,71962,4
71962,"I love the retro style of this swim dress, especially for under $30.",71962,4
71962,"It has a long torso, and the attached panty is actually boy shorts which are very comfortable.",71962,4
71962,"The skirt is an inch or two longer than most, which works for my longer legs.",71962,4
71962,I may also order the pink :-),71962,4
71963,"I selected the large, and based on size charts I am borderline ""normal"" and ""plus sized"" for most related garments on amazon.",71963,4
71963,"I read enough reviews to know that this garment would fit well enough, and the price made it seem worthy of the gamble.",71963,4
71963,"The mesh fabric feels smooth, the ruffles add a nice element, and there are no issues with the fit at my waist.",71963,4
71963,"Unfortunately, the halter top barely covers the chest (I am a D cup).",71963,4
71963,"I understand that the garment is meant to be revealing and that it isn't something one typically plans to wear for hours at a time, so it may just be an issue of my personal comfort.",71963,4
71963,"Still, I would rather not fight to keep everything ""tucked in"".",71963,4
71963,"I do like it (it just hasn't moved to ""love"" territory for me) and have no regrets regarding the purchase!",71963,4
71964,"It's comical actually, I am a fairly modest person.",71964,4
71964,I have two round dots on each breast with this shirt.,71964,4
71964,For the price it's no biggie.,71964,4
71964,Haven't worn to work yet.,71964,4
71964,We'll see who snickers LOL.,71964,4
71964,I am generally an XS -S. Based on the reviews I ordered the Medium.,71964,4
71964,It fits like a tunic just what I wanted.,71964,4
71965,"I like this dress, it is flattering to the figure but even with my assumption that it may be made for Asian market sizing, I ordered a size Large to fit my 5'6"" size 10 frame and it seemed to be one size too small.",71965,4
71965,"Unless someone wants to wear a really form fitting dress for the club scene, I would think an XL would fit a curvy size 10 better for weddings and special occasions.",71965,4
71966,"They were a smidge smaller than expected, but are absolutely adorable!",71966,4
71967,Very cute - stretchier fabric works way better with babies this age though.,71967,4
71968,Don't fit in any of my flat dress shoes but they do fit in my tennis shoes which is why I bought them.,71968,4
71969,Very cute dress silky and looks very nice!,71969,4
71969,"It's pretty tight in the bust area and it rides really short up front, you have to be careful that nothing falls out if you know what I mean.",71969,4
71969,Other than that it's very nice and I like it,71969,4
71971,"The socks are great, but I do think it's silly to charge so much for 1 pair of socks that hasn't been in style for 30 years.",71971,4
71971,"Ah well, at least they still make them.",71971,4
71971,Don't know what I'd do for my 80s party with out them.,71971,4
71971,"Oh, but they are darker shade of purple than they appear, which I was happy about.",71971,4
71973,These little sandals arrived promptly and were as I had expected them to be.,71973,4
71973,They were very inexpensive and I was not surprised at their construction.,71973,4
71973,They are perfect for hanging around the house.,71973,4
71974,They look just as they do in the picture.,71974,4
71974,The only reason I gave 4 stars is because I ordered an XXL and they are still small on me and I normally wear medium size leggings that you can buy in a store like target,71974,4
71975,I really can't believe how quickly the shirt delivered!,71975,4
71975,"I fully expected it to take 2-3 weeks, since the vendor seemed to be from China, but true to Prime's word, it delivered three days after I ordered it.",71975,4
71975,The shirt fits great!,71975,4
71975,"Funny thing, though: I ordered an XL, since these shirts tend to run small and (I've been losing weight), but the tag on the shirt says XXL, and fits like a large fits me.",71975,4
71975,"It also says that it's polyester, so I'm dubious as to its breathability.",71975,4
71975,"The design is bright and vibrant and is very clear, even the ""Rogers"" text on the sleeve.",71975,4
71975,"I'll be wearing it to my workout tomorrow morning, so I'll update my review once I see how it performs and holds up to a wash.",71975,4
71976,Can't wait to enjoy the warm weather!,71976,4
71977,Love the quality just slightly larger than I expected,71977,4
71978,"It fits a little tight for my son , the material is not stretchy.",71978,4
71978,But it looks nice.,71978,4
71979,"The part that removes the pin works fine, but it's not any sturdier/tougher than the plastic link remover I already have.",71979,4
71979,"The watch I have that bent the nib on my plastic tool did the same thing with this one, so I guess I'll have to break down and take it to a jewelry store.",71979,4
71979,The seller doesn't claim this is tool is heavy-duty so no blame goes to them.,71979,4
71979,The other part that is to be used to reinstall pins may work fine but I've not used it.,71979,4
71979,All the pins I've had slipped in easily and tapping them down with a small hammer was a lot easier than messing around with this.,71979,4
71979,I've no complaints and I would buy from this seller again.,71979,4
71980,If you are brave and have something you don't mind people seeing under it then go for it lol.,71980,4
71980,"Really loose comfy flouncy fabric,  but it was not flattering on me.",71980,4
71980,I have bigger bottom half.,71980,4
71980,I like the longer style more.,71980,4
71981,It's a lot larger than I thought it would be.,71981,4
71981,The top is pretty and the quality is good.,71981,4
71982,I like how it fits.,71982,4
71984,I purchased this for my 10 year old daughter.,71984,4
71984,"It seems fairly sturdy, and it's great for a kid who would get a kick out of seeing the rain drops through the clear plastic while it's protecting them.",71984,4
71984,"However, I borrowed it one rainy day and found the length to be cumbersome, and it was awkward to close; I was afraid that it would pinch my fingers.",71984,4
71984,"I used to think that I wanted a full size umbrella, but, after trying this one, I'll stick with the compact type.",71984,4
71985,"i love the pattern and i have gotten compliments from others who also enjoy looking at the alpacas..
the lining is black and white polka dot, which i think is cute , and it has several compartments including a zippered one in the middle.",71985,4
71985,for some reason i keep getting things lost or looking in the wrong compartment  before i get to where i want.,71985,4
71985,after several months of daily use it still looks brand new.,71985,4
71986,It was a nice hat just to big,71986,4
71987,"although the top was a little big, it still was a great buy i think.",71987,4
71987,even though it was big it did not show any goodies.,71987,4
71987,"I would recommend buying this product, but a size smaller",71987,4
71989,Fit true to size.,71989,4
71990,Order a size or two up,71990,4
71991,Good material with nice feel to it.,71991,4
71991,Holds up well and is not cheap-looking.,71991,4
71992,"Pretty, but a bit snug.",71992,4
71992,My neck isn't even that big.,71992,4
71993,"I love this suit, I can't wait to wear it on vacation.",71993,4
71993,The cutouts are great.,71993,4
71993,I have a long torso and it fit fine.,71993,4
71993,"I think they sent me the suit in the wrong color, but it's still cute.",71993,4
71995,"It was too small for a medium man, but fit a medium female well.",71995,4
71996,These were so cute.,71996,4
71996,"Nice and warm, well made, very pretty and felt great.",71996,4
71996,"The fit ran a bit small for me (I'm smaller boned but 5'8"").",71996,4
71997,I am a big fan of the sun and i stay in tune and i know when its best to cover up.,71997,4
71997,This hat helps with that with style and i'm glad i made the purchase!,71997,4
71997,Now in reading the other reviews about the hat being shipped in a box that was to small or being shipped damaged i am glad to say that was not the case for me.,71997,4
71997,The hat arrived safely in a box that was appropriately sized and there was a plastic form inside to help the hat keep its shape and to protect it from being crushed.,71997,4
71997,Now as i have only used this hat a handful of time at this point i cant yet speak to the durability but i will update should i have any issues.,71997,4
71997,Thanks for reading my review and i hope this helped-,71997,4
71998,I wear a size 6 dress and the belt fits great and looks nice.,71998,4
71999,Fit as expected - it is quite thin needing a tank top underneath .,71999,4
71999,i  have gotten many compliments on this shirt when I wear it.,71999,4
72000,Definetly need to size up to wear anything under it!,72000,4
72000,Good quality for a costume!,72000,4
72001,I knew that from reading reviews so I ordered up a size.,72001,4
72001,It's beautiful like the picture.,72001,4
72001,The reason I gave only 4 stars is because there is a blousing on the shoulders that isn't really noticible in the photo but when you put it on is very visible which just changed the look of the dress for me.,72001,4
72001,Still quite adorable just not what I was expecting.,72001,4
72002,A little wide for my ears.,72002,4
72003,"well made, good length, runs a bit tight",72003,4
72004,Very cute charm but the chain leaves a bit to be desired.,72004,4
72005,They fitt  great,72005,4
72006,Not as bright as I expected but I still love it xanw fastv,72006,4
72007,"I ordered a large I'm 5'3"" 127 lbs .",72007,4
72007,the bottom was perfect but the top was a no lol.,72007,4
72007,Will have to be altered a bit.,72007,4
72007,But overall I got what I paid for.,72007,4
72008,"My daughter is between a 12 and 14, and the 12 was a perfect fit.",72008,4
72008,My only issue is the color.,72008,4
72008,"It's royal blue, not navy blue.",72008,4
72008,We ended up dying it by using rit dyemore to get it to more of a navy blue.,72008,4
72008,She loved the dress!,72008,4
72009,Other than being a little tight the shoes are gorgeous!,72009,4
72009,The are perfect with my wedding dress!,72009,4
72010,"Nice sun hat, just a little snug on my larger than average ""melon"".",72010,4
72010,"Consider making a slightly larger size to complement the ""one size fits all"" standard.",72010,4
72011,They are good for what they are.,72011,4
72011,I ordered these because my daughter was scratching her face all the time.,72011,4
72011,"The material is thin, which I found to be a good thing so that she can use her hands to grab things, but not scratch her face.",72011,4
72011,The mittens had sufficient elastic to keep the mittens on her hands and not slide off.,72011,4
72011,"She was able to figure out how to pull them off herself, but they stayed on for the most part.",72011,4
72011,"They held up in the wash but after a few uses, the fabric is starting to pill.",72011,4
72011,This is to be expected since baby wears them much of the day.,72011,4
72012,So many tongue rings for a great price..  Only bad part is I have so many of the same ones now,72012,4
72013,nice for spring & summer,72013,4
72014,it's  lighter in color than the pic.,72014,4
72014,there's like a smoky white color in it.,72014,4
72014,it's says the color varies.,72014,4
72014,I would have prefered a darker color but it's still a pretty crystal.,72014,4
72015,Love these so much !,72015,4
72015,I missing a v shaped one but I think I got a second single stone ring instead.,72015,4
72017,I do not like the magnet to close it because the watch falls of a lot,72017,4
72018,Really like the sweater but did come a littel smaller than expected im glad i ordered a lg but seams if i wash it it will shrink to small but still realy like it...,72018,4
72019,"I like the belt, but it's made of a really light weight leather.",72019,4
72019,In fact if they didn't tell me it was leather I would have guessed it was made of a foam-like material.,72019,4
72019,"Because of this, I worry it will not last long; but I have been wearing it for about a week and no problems so far.",72019,4
72019,I think for the price it is worth a try.,72019,4
72019,the color and style is true to the picture!,72019,4
72020,For the price this bathing suit is great quality.,72020,4
72020,"It's rather difficult to put on but after looking at the diagram, it's easy to figure out.",72020,4
72020,"I'm normally a size 0/small so I ordered the small, but I would probably have ordered a size up if I knew how tight it would be.",72020,4
72020,"Other than that, great swim suit!",72020,4
72021,I wear a size 12 and it fit just right.,72021,4
72021,I was surprised since it is one size fits all.,72021,4
72021,"The red is more a wine color, which I prefer over red.",72021,4
72022,Runs long in torso.,72022,4
72022,"My husband is only 5'10"", but has a long torso and usually wears a XL.",72022,4
72022,The XL was way too long and was sized for someone well over 6 feet tall.,72022,4
72022,"Loved the intense cardinal red color, but have not washed it yet.",72022,4
72023,Like these a lot but they do tend to run a bit small,72023,4
72025,They were great to work with.,72025,4
72025,They got it to me in plenty of time.,72025,4
72025,Color was not as dark as pictured.,72025,4
72026,"A bit flimsier than expected, but still a fine hat",72026,4
72027,Overall happy with this product but much shorter than expected.,72027,4
72027,I wish it was longer!,72027,4
72028,"Good buy, good fit",72028,4
72029,This was smaller than expected and more of a going out skirt than professional.,72029,4
72029,"It makes my arse look great, though, and my boyfriend loves it.",72029,4
72030,Took too long to arrive.,72030,4
72031,"Really liked this corset a lot, but it smells really bad!",72031,4
72031,Not sure if it's the fake leather or what...,72031,4
72031,I sprayed perfume all over it and let it air out for a bit.... it worked out well for Biketoberfest in Daytona...:),72031,4
72032,It's beautiful with quality material... problem is the fit...,72032,4
72032,I ordered a size 12 even though I wear a size 8 (USA).,72032,4
72032,The dimentions mentioned in the size chart were even an inch larger than my size.,72032,4
72032,"When it arrived, it was very small- around 3.5 inches off on the chest and 2.5 inches off on the waist.",72032,4
72032,So I can't wear it.,72032,4
72032,I will probably just donate it.,72032,4
72032,I ordered express shipping so it would make it in time for an event.,72032,4
72032,I would have worn it if it fit.,72032,4
72033,Nice for the price!,72033,4
72033,Just what i needed.,72033,4
72033,And it arrived super fast.,72033,4

72034,"Nice coverage, especially in this HEAT.",72034,4
72035,"He has been ""Bernie"" since he was a toddler!",72035,4
72035,Wish it was cotton/polyester.,72035,4
72036,Cute but a little smaller than I expected.,72036,4
72037,"I'm 5'4"" 130lbs originally ordered a medium but it was too big and the neck piece broke when I put it on.",72037,4
72037,"Return was quick, then I ordered the small.",72037,4
72037,"Very happy with this purchase, can't beat the price!",72037,4
72037,"However, I will have to hem the bottom and want to replace the neck piece.",72037,4
72038,"Recieved it earlier than expected, looked at the photos of other buyers and the bottoms with print were not similar.",72038,4
72038,Other had the stitching hidden while I had stitching that was visible.,72038,4
72038,Usually I'm a small so ordered a small and top fit perfect bottoms are tight but it doesn't look odd.,72038,4
72038,But good purchase for 5$ .,72038,4
72038,Material is swimsuit material as well.,72038,4
72039,This scarf looks as it is pictured.,72039,4
72040,At first I was skeptical of this wallet because it was so cheap.,72040,4
72040,"I thought the leather would be low quality and the RFID blocker wouldn't work, but I was surprised.",72040,4
72040,"I really like this wallet, the leather isn't the super highest quality but its not terrible.",72040,4
72040,Personally I don't really know what quality leather feels like but it doesn't feel super cheap.,72040,4
72040,"All the slots are nice to have, it holds all my cards and ids.",72040,4
72040,The only thing I wished it had was an ID display but I guess it doesn't for the RFID functionality.,72040,4
72040,"Overall I really enjoyed this wallet, it has everything I was looking for except the ID display, it has a functional RFID blocker, quality leather, and a thin feel.",72040,4
72041,Cute prints and great price.,72041,4
72041,I have 10m old twin girls who are 17 and 21 pounds.,72041,4
72041,I ordered the large and medium and they fit perfect.,72041,4
72041,Snap sides make it quick and easy to take off,72041,4
72042,Arrived in great time.,72042,4
72042,Looks like the pic.,72042,4
72043,use these all the time,72043,4

72046,"Great bracelet, I would have expected a little more from it though.",72046,4
72046,"The material is not real leather, and it's actually quite big on my wrist.",72046,4
72046,"It's a little cheap, but it's a cute bracelet.",72046,4
72046,I would definitely buy another bracelet like this.,72046,4

72048,warm and very cute!,72048,4
72050,My hoodie is very comfortable and fits pretty flattering.,72050,4
72050,The only problem is  I wasn't able to pull the hood down over my shoulders :/,72050,4
72051,Husband liked the shirts they stay tucked in.,72051,4
72052,The cape was shown as an adult size but would only fit small adult or child.,72052,4
72053,neck line is too low cut for warmth otherwise comfy and warm,72053,4
72054,"Very cute, but way too big for my daughter- must be boys sizes although says unisize.",72054,4
72054,Had to return and guess correct size.,72054,4
72055,It fits me like a dress almost.,72055,4
72055,I think its meant for taller girls.,72055,4
72055,(Im 5'3)  Still really cute though.,72055,4
72056,I am a lady so the sneakers look rather larger on my foot in my opinion.,72056,4
72056,"However when I wore them, many people have stopped to compliment me.",72056,4
72056,I enjoy wearing them particularly when I ride my hands free sedway!,72056,4
72056,"If you consider buying these, I promise you will be the only one with them!",72056,4
72056,A very unique item for sure!,72056,4
72058,Holds me stuff out right.,72058,4
72059,It was just what I wanted.,72059,4
72059,The only minor things are that a lot of string sticks out so I had to cut it all off when I got it and the front of the shirt has the company logo on it.,72059,4
72061,Nice quality and would recommend for gift or self buy.,72061,4
72062,They have plenty of stretch so fit is fine.,72062,4
72063,Gave as a gift to my great grandson - hard to keep any shoes on him so a couple of hours would be the max.,72063,4
72063,Don't know about the arch support,72063,4
72064,"It took baby a solid three weeks to figure out how to bite them off, so they lasted more than three times longer than any other product we tried.",72064,4
72066,I like feminine sports shirts.,72066,4
72066,Fit is a little snug.,72066,4
72067,Decent fit and nice price,72067,4
72069,"A beautiful dress, but the sleeves are too short on my arms.",72069,4
72069,A dress with 3/4 sleeves would be perfect for fall events in New York.,72069,4
72070,My boyfriend loved it the minute he saw it on me.,72070,4
72071,"Nice pants, easy to care for.",72071,4
72071,Purchased one pair in black and one pair in brown...same size but both fit entirely differently.,72071,4
72071,The Black pair ran a bit small but the length was perfect.,72071,4
72071,The brown pair ran slightly larger and the length of the slacks was entirely too long.,72071,4
72071,"If you don't mind hemming, these pants are a good buy for the price.",72071,4
72072,I am 5.3' and 185 pounds and this dress fit me good and make me look skinny my only concern is in the bra part .,72072,4
72072,I use 40C and I think for people that is size 40DD will fit perfect.,72072,4
72073,I ordered this tie along with the Moda Di Raza Men's Necktie Woven Cloth Satin Finish Necktie - Mint Green assuming they would be the same color considering they came from the same seller.,72073,4
72073,The boys tie is darker.,72073,4
72073,We still used both for my wedding but the different colors made me give this product 4 stars instead of 5.,72073,4
72074,Mitts are a great idea but I haven't yet got the hang of  putting them on and getting a good fit.,72074,4
72074,I'm sure that will come with more use.,72074,4
72074,I like the compactness; they store so easily in your pocket.,72074,4
72074,"I was pleasantly surprised  to see that they do not cause any loss of hearing;
one can wear them and have a normal conversation or listen to music while out walking.",72074,4
72074,For something so lightweight they are surprisingly warm so I know I will use them often after I develop the technique for fitting them.,72074,4
72075,Good quality but order one size up!!,72075,4
72076,shirt is somewhat small for me.,72076,4
72076,I ordereed medium and I am usually a medium.,72076,4
72078,very very thin and meant for indoor wear!,72078,4
72078,still cute nonetheless :D,72078,4
72079,It does fit about half of a size too snug though.,72079,4
72079,I'd suggest buying one size larger than you'd normally wear.,72079,4
72079,"So far there's no green residue, and I've worn it a week straight.",72079,4
72079,Typically I'll start to get it right away if the jewelry is crummy.,72079,4
72080,"As others have mentioned, the color doesn't look exactly like white gold, it's a bit darker, but it's close enough.",72080,4
72080,"I have sensitive skin and a nickel allergy, and after almost a week of wear, I haven't had any issues.",72080,4
72080,"If you're looking for a durable, comfortable and simple band, you cannot go wrong with this one.",72080,4
72082,Nice and light material.,72082,4
72082,Fits a little snug in hip area for my liking.,72082,4
72082,"If I had gotten a larger size,  the neck and armholes would be too large.",72082,4
72084,"As expected
Nice
Didn't get to use it ,  came in too late .",72084,4
72084,But will keep it for the next occasion,72084,4
72085,I like the fit and also that the price is significantly less than Injinji.,72085,4
72085,My shoe size is 10 and the M/L fits perfectly.,72085,4
72085,I think these socks seem a bit more durable than Injinji.,72085,4
72085,They do rise a bit higher on the ankle.,72085,4
72085,I would guess that an inch of sock shows when wearing them with Vibrams.,72085,4
72086,"The fit, and feel of these pants are extremely nice.",72086,4
72087,The fabric is a bit thinner than I expected.,72087,4
72089,It was a little small but Im keeping it because it look really nice and I really don't like zipping up my jackets anyway.,72089,4
72090,The material quality is good - it'll be perfect if it is a bit bigger...,72090,4
72091,I watch that fits my purpose.,72091,4
72092,Perfect gift for a chef in the family,72092,4
72093,Satisfied with the glasses,72093,4
72094,Looks just like the NBA version.,72094,4
72094,The material is a little on the thin side but still worth the purchase.,72094,4
72094,Delivery was faster than expected arrival date.,72094,4
72094,"Overall, pleased with the purchase and the price.",72094,4
72095,"Its a gift for my daughter for Christmas, so she hasn't gotten it yet.",72095,4
72095,I does look comfortable and the correct size,72095,4
72096,A great mario costume for an affordable price.,72096,4
72096,Fits exactly as described.,72096,4
72098,fast shopping and it's looks like a picture,72098,4
72099,Beautiful and nice quality.,72099,4
72100,"Haven't worn yet, but love the look",72100,4
72101,Doesn't have good quality!,72101,4
72101,It is worth the price though!,72101,4
72102,Very nice for summertime.,72102,4
72102,Runs small for one size.,72102,4
72103,I wanted to love this dress so much!,72103,4
72103,The fabric is high quality.,72103,4
72103,The cut and color is wonderful.,72103,4
72103,"I should have listened to the online reviews :(  I'm 5""7"" with a long torso and large bust (34DD) so the waist hit 1-2 inches above my natural waist line which was not a flattering silhouette so I will have to return must to my disappointment.",72103,4
72104,I can't wait to wear this top.,72104,4
72104,"Color is great, fits very well; just know this is not supposed to be a tight fitting top.",72104,4
72105,The hats were a little small and the men wearing them had some problems with the size.,72105,4
72105,"However, the quality was great for the price.",72105,4
72105,I did not receive a copy of the billing information and any of the 20 hats I orders.,72105,4
72105,Could I get a copy for my records as it was not my money I was spending and I need to account for the cost.,72105,4
72106,"This is a really pretty dress, but I didn't read the review later before I bought it, and I should have.",72106,4
72106,"Like the others said, one strap was way too long across the ball, so it made it ill fitting.",72106,4
72106,"You could alter it if you wanted to, but that would probably be the same price of the dress.",72106,4
72106,Not worth it in my opinion.,72106,4
72106,"If not for that one thing, the dress is really cute.",72106,4
72107,Bought for my 5 year old to wear to a costume party and them use as pajamas.,72107,4
72107,It is really cute and the material is not bad.,72107,4
72108,These pants are extremely comfortable they are a little big and the legs are a bit longer than I like.,72108,4
72108,The skull pattern has a few faded areas looks like the pants were folded before the iron on pattern was fully set and cooled off.,72108,4
72108,Other than these few issues the pants are great,72108,4
72109,Punisher symbol stands out well.,72109,4
72110,..bottom is a little small.,72110,4
72110,I wear a size 6..had to get a lg...I like it though!,72110,4
72111,"Pretty good my wife bought this for herself^.^ she liked the fabric, but just a tad bit large on her",72111,4
72112,I should've purchased a medium.,72112,4
72112,But it's too cute to return!,72112,4
72113,"Long enough for my son, who is 5'7.",72113,4
72113,Haven't wash it yet.,72113,4
72113,Hopefully it doesn't wash off.,72113,4
72114,"Very sexy costume, I loved it.",72114,4
72114,"But hard for a tall girl to stretch, it was def riding up my butt and could of been longer for tall girls with long torsos.",72114,4
72114,"I'm 5'8"" but it worked fine for a stage performance, I showed a lot of butt to the audience but oh well.",72114,4
72114,"Be prepared, it rides up like a thong not full coverage on the butt.",72114,4
72116,Its so cute and I wish I got it sooner when my baby was younger.,72116,4
72116,Now she hates hats and refuses to wear this.,72116,4
72116,I try to stick it on her for pictures but it only lasts a minute.,72116,4
72116,The detail is great and material is well made.,72116,4
72117,.not bad im happy,72117,4
72118,"It's itchy, short (camel toe),  and loose sleeves that are right above the wrist.",72118,4
72118,But I'm reordering a larger size and hoping it fits better.,72118,4
72118,I ordered a L and going to try an XL.,72118,4
72118,"I'm 5'6 200lbs bust 38"" C waist 36"" hip 48"".",72118,4
72118,I like how tight it is but not how short it is.,72118,4
72119,I love this cami.,72119,4
72119,The only thing I will say is that the armpit area seems to flare out- like if I pulled the straps toward my neck the flaring would stop.,72119,4
72119,Maybe the shirt is build for bigger boobs I don't know lol.,72119,4
72119,"Other than that, I love this cami!",72119,4
72119,Not see through either.,72119,4
72120,Fit great except a little long.,72120,4
72121,A little bit small,72121,4
72122,The dress is size runs pretty small.,72122,4
72122,Got this for my wife and size large is pretty tight.,72122,4
72122,She is a dress size 8-10 usually.,72122,4
72122,Material is also really thin but I guess what do you expect for the price.,72122,4
72122,It looks on her just like it does in the picture style wise.,72122,4
72123,Thong was small and cheap but love the nightgown,72123,4
72124,I felt in love with this dress and bought a medium size.,72124,4
72124,"The dress is very nice, the material is good but it's a little bit too long and too large.",72124,4
72124,I forgot to notice that it was stretched.,72124,4
72124,I should have taken a small.,72124,4
72124,"Anyway, I still can wear or adjust it.",72124,4
72124,The material and color are very nice and it was received on time.,72124,4
72125,"Good product, comfortable, but loose in the legs where I was hoping they'd be a little snugger.",72125,4
72126,"Looks cute as can be, but the pivot is very loose so the bar moves VERY easily, it is so small you can't really hold it directly so it is pretty difficult to actually put in.",72126,4
72126,However once you get it in it is secure while being very comfortable to unclick when it's time to take it out which is great for a lower cost clicker...,72126,4
72126,I've had them get stuck before.,72126,4
72128,"I'm 5'0"", small boobs, 100 pds.",72128,4
72128,I ordered this in small.,72128,4
72128,The dress hits me at the knees.,72128,4
72128,"While beautiful, it is shinier than I had anticipated but I will be keeping it,

Took a few minutes to be able to clasp it and also to find zipper which is on left side.",72128,4
72128,"Once on, it's beautiful, yet fragile so be careful with handling it.",72128,4
72128,The price is great too.,72128,4
72130,It was exactly what I wanted.,72130,4
72130,The fabric is also super soft.,72130,4
72130,"My only issue is that the decal is a little tacky, but I think most t-shirts like that are.",72130,4
72130,"Also, while I was told the item would take 3-5 days just to ship, it actually arrived within two days which was great!",72130,4
72131,Its a tad bit larger but its flowy and pretty,72131,4
72134,My only complaint is that it is thin material and I have to wear a slip under it.,72134,4
72134,It is comfortable though and pretty.,72134,4
72135,"I really love this hat, it fit me perfectly and is super cute.",72135,4
72136,"Am only going with 4 stars as we haven't actually ""used"" the cover yet.",72136,4
72136,I ordered this color (blue) for my husband and a purple one for myself.,72136,4
72136,I was a little disappointed that the colors weren't as vibrant as shown in the pictures.,72136,4
72137,I have had a lot of compliments on this inexpensive ring.,72137,4
72137,It is a great conversation piece.,72137,4
72138,I love all the pockets it has.,72138,4
72138,They are perfect for me.,72138,4
72138,The only thing I was disappointed in was the quality.,72138,4
72138,It wasn't the quality that I was expecting.,72138,4
72138,The finishing touches inside were second quality and there are places that the cut was a little off.,72138,4
72138,These issues are not enough for me to not use the bag.,72138,4
72138,"For me, the pros far outweigh the cons.",72138,4
72139,The material is a little thin.,72139,4
72139,The thumbholes are a little ragged.,72139,4
72139,"It is OK, not sure I would buy it if I tried it on first.",72139,4
72140,This dress fit fine.,72140,4
72141,"Very pretty, my girl friend loves it.",72141,4
72142,Very comfy shoes with excellent support.,72142,4
72142,Very roomy but I'm wearing them with socks for house shoes.,72142,4
72142,To wear without socks would need to go down a size.,72142,4
72143,Very nice for the price!,72143,4
72144,"Love the look and it fits well, although a little snug and short waisted.",72144,4
72144,"That said, I'm very pleased with it.",72144,4
72146,The bottoms are very narrow for a little girl to wear.,72146,4
72146,Shows a bit of butt cheek,72146,4
72147,"The dress has really big arm holes, but fits everywhere else.",72147,4
72147,"The fabric is light, cool & breezy.",72147,4
72147,I would have returned it for a smaller size but return shipping was on me.,72147,4
72147,I wear with an under shirt or sweater.,72147,4
72147,This is the 2nd item from this seller & the last.,72147,4
72149,The only thing o don't like about this is that I have back fat and it doesn't get all of it and I have a big butt so it makes a crease in the back on my weighs and just go a size down from your shirt size,72149,4
72150,"This dress does not have pockets, picture is misleading.",72150,4
72150,"It is a little big around the waist, but it is a very nice quality skirt.",72150,4
72151,"Love the shirt, super comfy.",72151,4
72151,Just a little shorter than expected.,72151,4
72151,I like shirts that are on the longer side.,72151,4
72152,It's cute but so thin,72152,4
72155,"It's a cute bracelet and quality is deceptively good, too considering its Chinese made.",72155,4
72155,"The only downside, it was a bit too big for my narrow female wrist, so I had to shorten it.",72155,4
72155,"I actually ripped it out of the closure, cut one inch off of it and then glued it back in.",72155,4
72155,Now it looks good and fits perfectly :-),72155,4
72156,Order at least 2 sizes larger.,72156,4
72156,This is a lower cost option for a deep cut T shirt and great when wearing Hawaiian type shirts when you do not want your undershirt visible.,72156,4
72156,Keeps body oil and moisture away from expensive to clean silk shirts.,72156,4
72156,Would have given 5 stars but the shirt is tight fitting.,72156,4
72156,"BTW, this product is shipped from China but the wait time was only two weeks.",72156,4
72157,"The top was kinda small , but its super cute",72157,4
72158,it was a tight fit i got the largest size for my 2 yr old.,72158,4
72158,i wish they had bigger sizes for future purchases.,72158,4
72158,I would say the largest size would fit a 18 month old best.,72158,4
72159,Adorable outfit bit may fit him at 18 mos if even that,72159,4
72161,"Bought for undershirts, worked well but are a little to thin to wear on there own.",72161,4
72161,Could see my nips on a cold day.,72161,4
72162,I had heard a lot about the whole waist training thing and decided to use my Amazon credit on ordering one.,72162,4
72162,"I got it pretty quickly, soon after the expected arrival date.",72162,4
72162,"The price was reasonable, and the quality of material was great.",72162,4
72162,"It fit a little tight, but that's expected.",72162,4
72162,I've worn it while working out a few times but haven't seen a noticeable difference but I also haven't worn it super often.,72162,4
72162,I would buy from this seller again.,72162,4
72163,This case does all it claims to do.,72163,4
72163,The LED lights are awesome.,72163,4
72163,"As a professional makeup artist and nightlife entertainer, I find this case extremely useful for photographing makeup in dark nightclubs, as well as just generally taking front-facing photos where you wouldn't otherwise have access to a flash, let alone a ring-light-style setup.",72163,4
72163,The light coming from all sides of the face is extremely flattering.,72163,4
72163,"If you're an avid selfie-taker, this is for you.",72163,4
72163,The only reason I docked a star is this thing is extremely bulky.,72163,4
72163,"I personally don't mind this terribly, but I know that's the kind of thing that bothers a lot of people.",72163,4
72163,A lot of reviewers were saying they received cases that didn't fit their phones.,72163,4
72163,I got the one for the Galaxy S7 and it fit perfectly.,72163,4
72163,"If you are a Galaxy Edge user, this case leaves the edge feature accessible while still locking onto the phone.",72163,4
72163,"Overall I would recommend this to anyone who does makeup professionally or frequents bars and nightclubs, and doesn't mind having a heavy/bulky case on their phone.",72163,4
72164,I like the shirt  it fits well the only problem that I'm having is that the glitter  is falling off everywhere and it's annoying me other then that I'm happy with my purchase,72164,4
72166,"Great print, breathable and comfortable.",72166,4
72166,Only issue I had was the collar seemed too large for the shirt.,72166,4
72167,The gray one fit very nicely and is not see through.,72167,4
72167,"The black one seems to be cheaper, see through, and thinner fabric.",72167,4
72167,I would just stick with the gray.,72167,4
72168,can use shirt for other outfits as well,72168,4
72170,My daughter loves these necklaces and wears them daily.,72170,4
72170,"For what I paid for them, they have been fairly sturdy.",72170,4
72171,A little bit small to me and the material is so delicate!,72171,4
72172,Breast size is MUCH smaller than picture shows.,72172,4
72172,Fits a B cup at best.,72172,4
72173,"This is a cute purse, it is small but fits enough things inside like a big purse.",72173,4
72173,The only problem for me is that the chain is a little too short for me.,72173,4
72173,When I put the purse on my shoulder it is to my stomach lol but other than that the purse is good :),72173,4
72174,I have a booty so it looked very very tight.,72174,4
72174,I still loved wearing it for my baby shower!!!,72174,4
72174,I would recommend buying a cami to wear underneath it like I did but still wear bras because the top part that should be on top of boobs keeps moving once arms move.,72174,4
72174,That's the only thing I wish I could have paid attention.,72174,4
72174,Most of my pictures show my breasts (kind of),72174,4
72175,If your a very curvy girl (big butt) the top is bit loose but won't go pass my waist.,72175,4
72175,Still a cute top,72175,4
72176,"Perfect size, well-made and great colored stripes",72176,4
72178,I purchased to keep items organized in our large beach bag for vacation.,72178,4
72178,"However, I thought that these bags were entirely mesh, but they are not - they are plastic bags with a mesh outer-lay.",72178,4
72178,"I really see the point of the mesh outer-lay, except if you want to make the contents of your bag a bit more confidential (you can still see the contents, though).",72178,4
72178,"Really for me, all the mesh did was trap sand between it and the plastic bag lining, so it was a bit annoying.",72178,4
72178,"But they are well made, and the zipper is very sturdy, and the carbine is a nice touch as well.",72178,4
72179,made the 1st trimester sooo much easier.,72179,4
72180,Perfect fit for my nipples.,72180,4
72180,The ones I had before were too long and got caught on things and these were the perfect fit.,72180,4
72180,A little blingy for my taste but I'll take that over having my piercings caught on my watch all the time.,72180,4
72180,"Not internally threaded however, so I don't recommend it if your piercings are super new.",72180,4
72180,Quality of the metal is good and the color doesn't chip off like some other product.,72180,4
72181,If you work as a waitress this is a great purchase.,72181,4
72181,Only thing I didn't like was the shoulders seemed a little uneven at the tiny poof in the seam.,72181,4
72182,like the leg warmers  I wish they didn't stretch out so easy.,72182,4
72183,A very comfortable tank top for working out or walking.,72183,4
72183,I was a little disappointed that the inserts did not come with it (it has pockets for a built-in bra).,72183,4
72184,I love the bathing suit and the material it's made with.,72184,4
72184,The only problem is the the top of the bathing suit has size issues.,72184,4
72184,I ordered a medium and the cup size fit but the band around the chest area does not.,72184,4
72184,It is really really small (22 inches).,72184,4
72184,"I was able to exchange it for a large and it fit much better, but it's still tight around the same area.",72184,4
72184,"I'm 5'2"" 123 lbs if that helps anyone.",72184,4
72184,With a little bit of altering the band on the top on my end I absolutely love this bathing suit.,72184,4
72184,Definitely runs small though...,72184,4
72184,I would order a size or two larger.,72184,4
72185,I learned to look at the size it really fit.,72185,4
72185,So I can say the outfit really looks good on me.,72185,4
72185,And love the material.,72185,4
72186,"The shirt was a good quality material, although it seems to run one size smaller than it is.",72186,4
72188,The stainless steel credit card case was just right to hold my credit cards and a few extras.,72188,4
72188,What I like about it is the ease in which it takes to get take the cards out put them back in and I am satisfied with the product.,72188,4
72189,"I ended up ordering a small, because of my bust, but it is a tad large.",72189,4
72189,I have to fully tie it in the back for it to fit well.,72189,4
72189,"Otherwise, I like it.",72189,4
72189,"If your waist fits, your bust will most likely, considering it is very adjustable.",72189,4
72189,"It looks like a very modest top from the front, but it is very sexy from the back.",72189,4
72190,it is slightly tight at the top of the arm.,72190,4
72190,Other then that it is nice.,72190,4
72192,I'm 5'5 @ 129#.,72192,4
72192,I got a medium.,72192,4
72192,"It seemed a little short in the front and the sleeves didn't seem as ""float"" as I expected.",72192,4
72192,I'll order the large next.,72192,4
72192,It looks great with my Laredos.,72192,4
72192,Will order different colors.,72192,4
72193,Item arrived on time and intact.,72193,4
72194,Because they are big they did not fit as I wanted.,72194,4
72195,It runs very large.,72195,4
72195,I had to return them.,72195,4
72196,These bracelets are fun and cute.,72196,4
72196,"However, they are not very durable.",72196,4
72196,They also lose the silver color soon and turn bronze color.,72196,4
72196,"The delivery time was long, as anticipated.",72196,4
72196,The colors and size are accurate.,72196,4
72196,"I would order them for a little girl, not myself.",72196,4
72196,They would make great stocking stuffers or fun little Easter gifts.,72196,4
72197,It's cute as you can see in the pictures but the heart is too big,72197,4
72198,"I really like it, very cute.",72198,4
72198,"Not too tight and not too loose, just right.",72198,4
72198,Ill be buying another color,72198,4
72199,Have not used the bag yet.,72199,4
72199,The quality appears to be good.,72199,4
72200,doesn't like how material feels; fits perfectly,72200,4
72201,Works for what I needed it for.,72201,4
72202,"Beautiful dress but some of the details doesn't look like the picture shown, But still beautiful.",72202,4
72203,It rides up short if you have any booty.,72203,4
72204,"I like it.. good fit, the grey color is lighter than the pic.",72204,4
72205,Sooooo cute but just 1/2 inch too small!,72205,4
72205,This is usually fine for Comme Toi.,72205,4
72205,"Their Mediums run large on me, but if the skirt has any spandex or give the smalls are a perfect fit.",72205,4
72205,Just not so this time.,72205,4
72205,I am so sad it isn't stocked in a medium!,72205,4
72205,"I would have exchanged it for a larger size, but I will just have to return.",72205,4
72206,Fits my laptop and still has plenty room for more.,72206,4
72207,Size ran small an exchange went smooth an quick,72207,4
72208,Great T-shirt for my son.,72208,4
72208,"Fit perfectly and it's a regular cotton tee, nothing funny about sizing.",72208,4
72209,I like these jeans a lot.,72209,4
72209,I own 4 pair now.,72209,4
72209,I wish I could find this style in a little less canvas feeling material.,72209,4
72209,That is the only thing I would change.,72209,4
72210,My only complaint is the bra padding feels like stiff cardboard which is misshapen.,72210,4
72210,I'll have to cut them out to fix it.,72210,4
72211,"Love this top, comfortable and cute!",72211,4
72212,This dress is okay.,72212,4
72212,I am satisfied with the purchase.,72212,4
72212,I know some variation in color is to be expected- however I just wish there was some of the bright yellow in the front of the dress (there's a small bit in the back).,72212,4
72212,The blue and pink (in my opinion) isn't as bright as I expected either.,72212,4
72212,"Also, everyone else said that this dress ran small so I bought a medium (usually wear small) and it is sort of baggy.",72212,4
72212,"For the price, it is cute though.",72212,4
72212,I will def wear more as a bikini cover up probably when I go on vacation.,72212,4
72214,I'm a size 4 and i purchased a size small i wore these to crossfit and they were nice didn't ride up,72214,4
72215,The hat looked nice.,72215,4
72215,It was a bit darker than what was in the picture.,72215,4
72215,I bought it for my 7 year old nephew and it was definitely one he will grow into.,72215,4
72215,"He liked it, but every time he bent over it fell off.",72215,4
72215,It seemed to be good quality.,72215,4
72215,He is pretty rough on his clothing and this seems to be holding up quite well for him.,72215,4
72216,This is a handsome heavy watch.,72216,4
72216,The bezel does not turn.,72216,4
72216,The watch band has pins.,72216,4
72216,The pins have slots as though they are screws but they are not.,72216,4
72216,Overall an apparently good value.,72216,4
72217,I loved this hat!,72217,4
72217,"I bought it for my grandson, but it is definitely something that he would have to grow into.",72217,4
72217,It seems to be made properly.,72217,4
72217,It was not damaged by shipping and held it's shape well.,72217,4
72217,I am reviewing this product to assist other consumers in making informed choices in what they buy.,72217,4
72217,I am providing my honest opinion for others.,72217,4
72217,Honesty is stressed for reviewers.,72217,4
72217,Both positive and negative reviews are encouraged.,72217,4
72217,There is no compensation or repercussions that bias my opinion.,72217,4
72217,"If my review was helpful, please click the Helpful button.",72217,4
72217,"How I rate items:

1 Star: (I hate it!!!",72217,4
72217,): I would NOT recommend.,72217,4
72217,"2 Stars: (I don't like it): But, the product has some slight redeeming quality.",72217,4
72217,3 Stars: (Its O.K.,72217,4
72217,): Others may like it more than I do.,72217,4
72217,"4 Stars: (I like it): Good product, but it may have some minor issues.",72217,4
72217,5 Stars: (I love it!!!,72217,4
72217,): Perfect item and I will recommend it.,72217,4
72220,I ordered a size 8 based on reviews but probably could've gotten way with a 6.,72220,4
72220,"It is a little loose in places, specifically the bust and I'm a pretty busty lady (34DD).",72220,4
72220,The back of the dress has elastic and stretches and would've fit my bust a bit better had I gone with the 6.,72220,4
72220,The waist does tie but is also a little looser than I would've liked.,72220,4
72220,When I think pin-up wiggle dress I think of something very form fitting.,72220,4
72220,The only real issue I had that makes me glad I ordered the 8 was the zipper.,72220,4
72220,"I may have struggled to zip the 6, but I'm sure it could have been done.",72220,4
72220,"It gets stuck, especially around the waist ribbon, so I found it works best if you twist the dress so the zipper is on the front, zip it past the ribbon, then turn the dress back to normal and continue zipping.",72220,4
72220,The fabric is fairly stiff cotton.,72220,4
72220,Perhaps with a wash it'll soften up and shrink a little in the right places.,72220,4
72220,All in all it IS a really cute dress and I do recommend it.,72220,4
72221,"A little short - I'm 5'8"" - but will work.",72221,4
72222,The ears on the cat purse have a tendency to flop forward and not stay upright.,72222,4
72222,But I still got compliments about it.,72222,4
72223,"Admittedly, I have a big head, but this hat just barely fits the circumference of my head.",72223,4
72223,Otherwise I really like it.,72223,4
72223,"Cool, folds nicely, and can be seen (almost) from space.",72223,4
72224,Very comfortable cheap and fun only problem is I'm a 32 waist and have slightly above average size and needed to order an xl and still could barely fit into the sheath but definitely worth the price just order a size or 2 up,72224,4
72225,The jewelry set is pretty!,72225,4
72225,I bought it for a 5 year old who was ecstatic when she received it & put it on as soon as she opened the package.,72225,4
72226,Cute and comfortable.....runs alittle small,72226,4
72227,"I ordered an XL from reading the reviews; however, this size was too large for me, but I still received numerous complements on the top!",72227,4
72227,It would be a great buy for anyone.,72227,4
72227,I wear a size 8-9; but I am top heavy (36DD).,72227,4
72227,I should have ordered either a M or a L.,72227,4
72228,Good as with price,72228,4
72229,"relaxed fir, perfect for summer layering",72229,4
72230,fabric quality is poor,72230,4
72231,They are a bit floppy compared to the previous pair we had for my daughter.,72231,4
72231,They do the job and she never has to wear them for too long so we are happy with them overall.,72231,4
72233,I went of the suze from another person who had bought the item.. She was the same size and weight but the size she recommend was still small.,72233,4
72233,Had to send item back.,72233,4
72233,I wish i could've fit it.,72233,4
72234,I got many compliments on this shirt!,72234,4
72235,"I ordered a size 12, I am 5'4 190lbs.",72235,4
72235,Size 12 in jeans and a size 10 or Large in tops.,72235,4
72235,This shirt is very comfortable.,72235,4
72235,"Has a sweatshirt feel to it, very casual but cute!",72235,4
72235,I am thinking about buying the grey one either in a size 10 or again 12.,72235,4
72235,I recommend if you like casual chic ;-),72235,4
72236,"Did not know it was that big, but was as pictured",72236,4
72238,"I think the quality is good and the fit is beautiful, but I was disappointed it did not have pockets.",72238,4
72238,"The pictures I saw were of women with their hands kind of tucked to their sides and I, mistakenly, thought it had pockets.",72238,4
72238,Please make them with pockets and I will buy more.,72238,4
72239,This product is a lot lighter than expected but is still workable!,72239,4
72240,"I like this romper, however, I am a bit larger in the bust area and had to return a large for an x large.",72240,4
72240,The romper fit perfectly everywhere else.,72240,4
72240,I will be ordering this product again.,72240,4
72241,"Love the dress, it is just a little big on me but most everything fits me that way.",72241,4
72242,"Purchased this for my wife as a backup wedding band to wear when working out in the garden,yard, etc.",72242,4
72242,This ring is a surprising value and looks and feels like it would be much more expensive.,72242,4
72242,The fit was spot on the same as her wedding band.,72242,4
72244,"The fabric is too thing, I wish you can make it on a ticker fabric.",72244,4
72246,My girlfriend loves it,72246,4
72247,Fits phone but no lip edge,72247,4
72248,"beautiful, good quality dress, fabric is pretty looks just like the picture.",72248,4
72248,"just arrived to late loved this dress looks just like the picute other people sell this dress for over 100 dolloars worth the money an looks goon on im 5""4 155 36c n i ordered a medium",72248,4
72249,"Nice little case, kinda small, I would like to see it a little bigger with more holes for storing items.",72249,4
72249,"Like another reviewer said, you have to take the props off to get it in the case and if your antennas stick up off of the quad then your radio sets down on the antennas.",72249,4
72249,"Overall, its a nice case for the price.",72249,4
72249,Not so expensive that you feel bad cutting the foam to customize.,72249,4
72250,The good news is the 3XL fit me perfectly.,72250,4
72250,The bad news is I'm an American size 6/8.,72250,4
72250,I wouldn't recommend this dress for anyone larger than an 8,72250,4
72251,These fit kind of big.,72251,4
72251,No real feel against skin but a sexy look that can be combined with other garments,72251,4
72252,"I feel sexy in these, but the waist slips a little.",72252,4
72253,It was good just a little big.,72253,4
72254,"This is a great top, I can't wait to wear it this spring.",72254,4
72254,It's better quality than I expected.,72254,4
72255,This is a great swimsuit and the material is great!,72255,4
72255,I'm giving it 4 stars because it is a little big.,72255,4
72255,Overall for the price it's great quality.,72255,4
72255,"I'm 5'2 and 168lbs, so I ordered 12-14, but should had purchased 10-12.",72255,4
72256,"The bust is a little big at the top,it flares out some and my daughter is a DD.",72256,4
72256,we have it taken in before she wears it.,72256,4
72256,The fabric is nice and it looks well made.,72256,4
72257,Thanks ..cute little outfit ..fit good .,72257,4
72259,great fit for my daughter,72259,4
72260,I just wish I had choose a different shape.,72260,4
72260,Other wise very nice.,72260,4
72261,Runs small but is still lovely!,72261,4
72261,I have not washed or worn it yet.,72261,4
72262,"this was a gift, so I heard no complaints",72262,4
72263,Finally a minimalist design that works for me.,72263,4
72266,If you are looking for a hat that fits like your favorite Team hat then this isn't the one you want.,72266,4
72266,This hat is very tall and you can easily tuck your ears into it.,72266,4
72266,"If that's not what you want then look for the newer model with the ""low crown""  Other than that it's a well made hat with a few panel stitching imperfections and velcro patches are slightly askew...",72266,4
72266,But you can hide that with the right patch placement.,72266,4
72267,Fit as expected and is cute,72267,4
72268,"They are thin, perfect for my baby to walk around and not slide everywhere.",72268,4
72268,"Only thing is, these are supposed to be for boys, and they had ruffles around the ankles.",72268,4
72268,"Luckily these are just used for around the house, so I don't care.",72268,4
72268,Just weird seeing my Boy with what looks like girls socks.,72268,4
72269,Super sexy and my fianc  loved it.,72269,4
72269,I normally am an extra large because i have very large chest & butt so thats the size i went with.,72269,4
72269,"It was actually a little big especially on the butt, but hopefully with wash it may shrink some.",72269,4
72269,"Otherwise it was very sexy, arrived quick.",72269,4
72269,I want to buy a black one now!,72269,4
72270,If you aim to look fly you've come to the right place.,72270,4
72270,"While not the most quality material, these do their job well and look like pricey designer glasses.",72270,4
72270,Love the blue tint.,72270,4
72271,"I have to admit, this is an odd sweater.",72271,4
72271,"But if you like unusal clothing, this sweater will definitely make you happy.",72271,4
72271,The fit is excellent - looks great with black tights.,72271,4
72271,I typically wear either a small or medium and the medium fit well.,72271,4
72271,The material is quite thick and warm.,72271,4
72271,Looks good buttoned or unbuttoned.,72271,4
72272,Nice looking zip cover for smaller throw pillow.,72272,4
72272,Durable so it's ok for patio use too.,72272,4
72273,"The person I bought it for loves it and wears it all the time, but the jacket looked smalled than what I was personally expecting.",72273,4
72275,"Good material, beautiful design but it's small unless you don't have butt I guess xD",72275,4
72276,Very pretty and dainty -,72276,4
72277,I think with any ring like this the ball is really hard to put back on especially with lip piercings.,72277,4
72278,They were cheap so I don't expect the best quality.,72278,4
72278,They are only for a photo shoot.,72278,4
72278,They look a little cuter in the photo but most things do.,72278,4
72279,Narrow and tight but i am going to give them a shot and try to break them in.,72279,4
72280,A little small but nothing too bad,72280,4
72281,The sleeves are a little too long.,72281,4
72281,But overall a cute sweater!,72281,4
72282,The quality of the fabric is great.,72282,4
72282,Since it is elastic it fit pretty good but the dress is very long.,72282,4
72282,Other than that it is a great dress,72282,4
72283,"This  is a nice dress, I bought it a size bigger.",72283,4
72284,This is a beautiful top.,72284,4
72284,It runs small so order a size up.,72284,4
72284,I love the lace.,72284,4
72284,"I bought it for everyday wear, but you could go anywhere in this top.",72284,4
72284,I do not regret the purchase.,72284,4
72285,I have previously had the slide belt.,72285,4
72285,This is a good alternative if you are looking for a similar system but different belt designs or colors.,72285,4
72286,Love the color & style but was too small so had to return it & order a bigger size,72286,4
72287,I really like the soft leather of these gloves.,72287,4
72287,They do a good job of keeping my hands warm in average cold temperatures.,72287,4
72287,The touchscreen function of the gloves are a hit and miss.,72287,4
72287,I have to get it at the right angle to work.,72287,4
72287,"The packaging was amazing, and very professional looking.",72287,4
72287,"Overall, a good pair of gloves that I'd recommend.",72287,4
72288,It's a really nice purse.,72288,4
72288,It is of good quality soft leather not thin & cheap.,72288,4
72288,It fits on my shoulder nicely which is a big thing for me-shoulder feel & fit.,72288,4
72288,I doubt I will use the long strap but will keep it in the purse just in case I ever need it to be hands free.,72288,4
72288,I do really like that the compartments are separate.,72288,4
72288,another big issue with me for a purse.,72288,4
72288,I have found over the years it's so much easier to find things when there is a divider or separated sides.,72288,4
72288,I like that it is deep enough but not so deep are trying to find things way in the bottom of your bag.,72288,4
72288,So over all I'm completely pleased with my purchase & will recommend it to anyone for looking for a nice quality bag at a decent price.,72288,4
72288,I've found even the most expensive brand name bags  are not worth the price anymore  !,72288,4
72288,Most times they are not of any better quality.,72288,4
72289,"Great when pregnant, daughter likes them",72289,4
72290,Great looking dress for the price.,72290,4
72291,Shorts are big  but outfit is cute.,72291,4
72292,MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED THEM.,72292,4
72293,I have other kilts that fit perfectly.,72293,4
72293,I ordered this one in the same size as my others only to be disappointed that it is too small to get on.,72293,4
72293,Have not sent it back yet.,72293,4
72293,Great looking and apppears well constructed.,72293,4
72293,As for the kilt I would give five stars.,72293,4
72293,I took off one star for the sizing being too small.,72293,4
72293,Consider ordering two sizes larger when ordering.,72293,4
72294,Comes in a super cute gift box :),72294,4
72295,"I like these, but they run a just a tiny bit small for me.",72295,4
72295,"The waist rolls down a little, as well.",72295,4
72296,"I like these tights, they're very warm, but they refuse to stay up!",72296,4
72296,"I have to pull as hard as I can to get them up, then wear tight shorts with a belt over them just to keep them there.",72296,4
72297,I did a lot of research on this product seeing if it will fit well.,72297,4
72297,And it did I am 5'3 about 150lb and I got a XL the bottom is a tad loose but still fit and the top fit well.,72297,4
72297,The clips are a little strange but I really loved them.,72297,4
72297,It hide all my chub and all!,72297,4
72298,I like how fast this product was shipped to me.,72298,4
72298,I also love how the product actually matched the picture given.,72298,4
72298,"It was everything that I was looking for, for my baby.",72298,4
72299,Ordered a large because of the reviews I read fits perfect.,72299,4
72299,Love that it hides the belly part specially if you want to hide it after having kids lol.,72299,4
72299,Good quality and it's cute !,72299,4
72300,They are nice I like them the waist is just a little to large but nothing extreme.,72300,4
72301,color is nicemeterial is comfortablevery is thinvery coolbody size is goodarm size is a little tight,72301,4
72302,"Love the shirt--fit's a bit snug, though.",72302,4
72304,"Great product, keeps my head warm.",72304,4
72304,"The ""Green Day"" lettering is perfect, but the heart hand grenade is a little off.",72304,4
72305,Size XL is probably a size 10/12.,72305,4
72305,Looked amazing but too tight,72305,4
72306,Very sexy but not quite the fit I was hoping for.,72306,4
72306,Maybe better for a more busty woman.,72306,4
72306,"Other than that, I do feel quite sexy in it!",72306,4
72307,"nice top great for a summer evening.or a night out ,it,s pretty.",72307,4
72308,Awesome looking running or yoga pants.,72308,4
72308,Only about a 31 inch inseam on large.,72308,4
72309,Only thing I don't like about this is the smell.,72309,4
72309,Other than that it's perfect.,72309,4
72309,My Mac fits perfectly and j can fit a few other things inside as well.,72309,4
72309,This will come in perfectly when I cosplay Ema Asahina for YoumaCon this year.,72309,4
72309,Overall I am very happy with this.,72309,4
72310,"great shirt, fits just as expected.",72310,4
72310,You will have to iron this shirt overtime you wear it but it is a very pretty shirt.,72310,4
72311,Ordered an extra small.,72311,4
72311,To me it wasn't as fitted as I expected but I still like the shirt,72311,4
72312,She wears US medium/large and fit fine probably due to the lace and tie up the back.,72312,4
72313,"It fit kind of big, but hey overall I love it and he loves it.",72313,4
72313,Can't complain with that.,72313,4
72314,It resembles Triangl swimwear for mearly a smidge of the price.,72314,4
72314,At first I was nervous to buy dupe Triangl because Triangl is known for their quality material that makes the brand name so successfully popular.,72314,4
72314,"This dupe, in my opinion, is not far from the real thing.",72314,4
72314,The material is thick and feels identical to Triangl.,72314,4
72314,"Other reviewers have claimed that they believe this suit does not run true to size, I feel as though it was pretty close to it.",72314,4
72314,"I am 5' 2"" and weight 115.",72314,4
72314,I purchased a small and the bottoms were a slight bit snug but other than that very true to size.,72314,4
72314,I was so happy with finding this bathing suit make that I purchased two in addition.,72314,4
72314,Definately would recommend purchasing one!,72314,4
72314,Price is unbeatable for the quality!,72314,4
72315,It fits right (I ordered 3 sizes up) and it is comfortable to wear.,72315,4
72315,"It is put together well, and the fabric is acceptable.",72315,4
72315,"I do recommend this top, it's very cute!",72315,4
72316,They are ten dollar glasses.,72316,4
72316,The build quality is of ten dollar glasses.,72316,4
72317,i would like it a little longer,72317,4
72318,Only thing is I wish it would have had more pictures,72318,4
72319,"These were bought for my baby granddaughter so she doesn't wear them all the time, but they felt comfortable to me and I assume that the baby would be comfy in them.",72319,4
72320,very attractive shirt but runs quite small.,72320,4
72320,I bought extra large for my husband who normally takes large and it is a little snug.,72320,4
72321,"I originally bought these for a concert, but now wear them climbing most of the time.",72321,4
72321,"They are comfortable, the color hasn't faded, and the pattern doesn't stretch out.",72321,4
72321,It is a thick enough material you can do yoga in them and they won't become see-through.,72321,4
72321,They fit me well - 5'7 in pretty good shape,72321,4
72322,Material feel soft and warm.,72322,4
72322,It just pick up lint so quick,72322,4
72324,The bottom piece fits absolutely perfectly!,72324,4
72324,"The top, however, can be picky.",72324,4
72324,"If you don't mind your boob showing completely instead of tastefully, then you're fine.",72324,4
72325,Would give 5 stars if it was made a little better.,72325,4
72325,Button holes are too close to the edge of the placket and it pulls a little leaving slight gap between buttons.,72325,4
72325,"Also, you need to order up about 2 sizes but they are great to sleep in and if I get get called out in the middle of the night I just throw on a pair of jeans and my boots and jacket I am ready to hit the door and it looks great.",72325,4
72326,Nice material but al little small .,72326,4
72326,we ordered two models and the other one same size it is a little bigger,72326,4
72327,Was a gift for my niece & she loved it!,72327,4
72327,Wore it the day she got it!,72327,4
72329,Very nice hat mine fit lil tight but its adjustable.,72329,4
72329,When i adjust it one its to loose so im hoping it will stretch with time.,72329,4
72329,The top was squished dwn some but that to should fix with time!,72329,4
72331,Love the shirt but should have order bigger size got it in the mail I ordered a large it was smaller than I expected so Amazon is working with me and sending me a bigger size!,72331,4
72331,Other than that I love the way it looks.,72331,4
72332,"They look good and I was pleased with them, until the first time I dropped them at the end of the first week I had them, and they broke.",72332,4
72332,"I'm not sure what they meant by ""shatterproof"" but they did not survive a normal drop from 5 ft to concrete.",72332,4
72333,"Quality belt, happy with my purchase.",72333,4
72335,Great for replacing worn out insoles when you need extra support.,72335,4
72336,"Love this dress, very light and comfortable for those very hot summer days ...
even my daughter complimented it... only issue I ordered a size 12 and it is
very loose.",72336,4
72336,"so not sure if I may just have it tailored or send it back for a
size smaller.",72336,4
72337,I ordered a large which is typically what I am but this feels a little tight.,72337,4
72337,It's also extremely thin material and the colors don't really match the picture.,72337,4
72338,"I ordered a size larger than what I normally wear and they are still a little snug, but I am keeping them since I'm sure the elastic will give a little after wearing and washing them several times.",72338,4
72338,The front zipper is well-made.,72338,4
72338,"The fabric that covers the padding is coming off, so I will probably have to throw the padding away eventually because the sponge material will bunch up without the soft fabric liner on it.",72338,4
72339,The boots right great my only problem was I couldn't zip them up my legs,72339,4
72340,"The socks are nice, but I'm not sure What happened to George Washington...",72340,4
72341,"This fit pretty much as expected, but it is a little shorter than the picture shows.",72341,4
72341,The model must be fairly short.,72341,4
72341,"I am 5'8"" and it comes to my lower calves (more like a tea length dress).",72341,4
72342,"There's 3 adjustment snaps on the collar, but I wish there were at least 4 because when I wear it snapped on the tightest button, it's too big/loose

But they're good quality, and getting 4 for the price of 1 is always nice",72342,4
72343,Good belt for 10 bucks.,72343,4
72344,I'm only giving this a 4 star because I wasn't aware of the material when I bought it.,72344,4
72344,I thought it was a traditional cotton t-shirt but it's more of an athletic tee.,72344,4
72344,My son really didn't care what material it was...since he is happy then so am I.,72344,4
72345,"Sequins are falling off very easily, but it's a pretty dress...",72345,4
72346,Both are nice rings.,72346,4
72346,To large but not returning them.,72346,4
72348,"I'm 5ft, 105lbs, and 34D.",72348,4
72348,This dress is so cute.,72348,4
72348,the back is thinner material so you may have to wear a slip or compression shorts.,72348,4
72348,But it's a very cute dress!,72348,4
72349,"So these are small, so adjust your expectations.",72349,4
72349,"I still like them, but take special care to not lose them by keeping them in the pouch that they came in.",72349,4
72349,You'll also find that this preserves the gold plating.,72349,4
72350,Product came before set time frame and is as advertised.,72350,4
72351,This is a good idea.,72351,4
72351,I like the option of having the cuffs up.,72351,4
72351,These didn't work for me because I seemed to be between sizes.,72351,4
72351,I opted for a driving glove instead.,72351,4
72352,I would have given 5 stars if all the LED's were lighting.,72352,4
72352,One of the LED's wasn't working since day one & I was just too lazy to return it over one bulb.,72352,4
72352,I would have preferred if there was some quality control and if all the LED's in this product were functional at least for some time after I got it.,72352,4
72353,smells like rubber really bad my head hurts when i wear it idk maybe this one smell like this but it fits well .,72353,4
72353,it doesn't roll up.,72353,4
72353,when buying don't buy your exact waist.,72353,4
72353,"I'm  40 something i think so i bought 38""",72353,4
72354,"The necklace hung a little awkward but I think that was because of the dress, not 100% sure my will be wearing again tomorrow with another outfit.",72354,4
72354,Nonetheless I liked it and will purchase more from this company.,72354,4
72355,My son loves it except the sound for the intercom is so low no one else can even hear it.,72355,4
72356,I loved the coat and  the workmanship is superb but it was about four sizes too small.,72356,4
72357,This is definitely a super sexy bikini that I wore to day club.,72357,4
72357,"However, I bought a medium and I'm about 135lb 5'6'' and it was a bit big.",72357,4
72357,The sizing didn't look like how it did on the model.,72357,4
72357,The sides were not on the hips but more so in the middle of the waist and hips.,72357,4
72357,"Also, to be honest it didn't really cover my private area in the front as well and that is the only downfall.",72357,4
72357,I had to sew it to make it fit better which sucked.,72357,4
72357,"But, the french cut on the butt makes you look really good.",72357,4
72358,The pendant and chain are okay.,72358,4
72358,The picture inside is all right as well.,72358,4
72358,"In general, I like it and it suits its purpose (as a gift).",72358,4
72359,"Very cute skirt, which it was available in an XL.",72359,4
72359,I take a 10/12 and it was a smidge tight.,72359,4
72361,Very soft and sexy,72361,4
72362,"This says it fits size 16 to 22, and as I am normally a 24, I took a risk and ordered it anyway.",72362,4
72362,To my surprise (and happiness!),72362,4
72362,"everything fit, including the tights!",72362,4
72362,"For those wondering, I am 5' 7"" and typically fit a size 3x or 24.",72362,4
72363,"It worked out fine, the size fits, material is thin but you get what you paid for......it will need ironing and using high heat with steam worked out fine!",72363,4
72365,"Cute purse, can't put much in if you use a wallet but I like it.",72365,4
72365,My friend liked it too and wants one.,72365,4
72366,This top was purchased for casual wear in the upcoming Fall and Winter seasons.,72366,4
72366,"It fits somewhat smaller than expected, but will compliment any number of pair of jeans.",72366,4
72367,I mean you get what you pay for...$18 lol.,72367,4
72367,But it was actually pretty cute!,72367,4
72367,A little awkward in certain places but well worth the money.,72367,4
72368,I'm a 34B and this made me look much more endowed.,72368,4
72368,"Not what I was going for, but fine.",72368,4
72368,"Support is good enough for a light workout, probably wouldn't go running in it though.",72368,4
72368,Overall does the trick of being able to nurse easily pre- and post-workout.,72368,4
72369,"The clear string kind of doesn't stay in the clip properly, but you can make it work.",72369,4
72369,The horns make you look hella cute too.,72369,4
72370,I love this dress it is perfect for the hot Florida weather here.,72370,4
72370,Very flowy and comfortable.,72370,4
72370,"I normally wear a 10, so I ordered the large at first.",72370,4
72370,"It was really boxy looking, so I returned it for the medium and it fits perfectly.",72370,4
72370,"Can be worn alone as a dress, and would probably be cute with leggings too.",72370,4
72371,But its pretty much straight forward pair of kitty undies :),72371,4
72372,"I love the bathing suit, the bottom fits perfect, the top is a little large.",72372,4
72373,Really colorful and chain is very hard to break,72373,4
72374,It holds my iPhone 5.,72374,4
72374,"Does not hold dollar bills, have to fold in half to fit.",72374,4
72374,Delivery was perfect and on time.,72374,4
72375,I LOVE my RBG shirt!,72375,4
72375,I live in a pretty liberal town and I never fail to get compliments on it when I wear it.,72375,4
72375,Shirt is good quality and fits as expected.,72375,4
72375,The photo of RBG is a bit blurry.,72375,4
72375,That's not a huge deal to me but it might be off putting to some people.,72375,4
72376,Have to take it to a tailor to have it adjusted.,72376,4
72376,I usually wear a large but apparently should have chosen medium instead.,72376,4
72376,The material is quite good and the blouse is well made.,72376,4
72377,It is beautiful but shoulder area is not fitting well for some reason.,72377,4
72378,"Quite nicely made...I am 5'1"" and 120 lb and it fit a bit too large/ too long.",72378,4
72378,"That being said, I will keep it and wear it with high heeled boots.",72378,4
72378,This would be perfect for a larger and taller person.,72378,4
72378,It's a beautiful poncho.,72378,4
72379,I love the postpartum support this offers - it is great.,72379,4
72379,I'm not sure how much it helped my belly shrink but the support was good only wish this was cheaper.,72379,4
72380,"Fabric is heavier than I expected, more like sweatshirt weight.",72380,4
72380,"Very comfortable, cozy and cute, and it fits great!",72380,4
72381,Treated some brand new shoes and let them air dry.,72381,4
72381,Tested them out - the water beaded up and slid right off!,72381,4
72381,Wil buy again when I run out!,72381,4
72382,I like this necklace as the color is  good and strong.,72382,4
72382,It is a little chunky but will go well with my navy sweater.,72382,4
72384,Added flare to sleeve for laptops.,72384,4
72384,Arrival time took slightly longer than anticipated.,72384,4
72384,"Product seems to be neoprene, pretty good quality material.",72384,4
72384,No issues with zippers.,72384,4
72385,"Wore this to a Onesies Friendsgiving Dinner (yes, it's a thing haha) and it was a hit!",72385,4
72385,"My friends and other guests really loved the ""Bear Cheeks"" flap detail.",72385,4
72385,"I mean, how can you not?",72385,4
72385,It really makes this onesie.,72385,4
72385,"My only ""complaint"" is that I wish it was black snaps instead of black buttons.",72385,4
72385,"Other than that, it was a definitely worthwhile purchase.",72385,4
72385,I ended up wearing it to bed because it was so cozy!,72385,4
72386,"the colors are a off, i wanted to be Sailor Plut and ended being Sailor Saturn...
but it was beautiful anyways",72386,4
72387,My granddaughter really loved it!,72387,4
72388,"it fits great, not exactly ""velvet"" or even velvet looking but other than that it will work well for me",72388,4
72389,"Have tried this on, but it's a little small on me so I need to adjust much of it to fit me.",72389,4
72389,Haven't worn this yet with a dress.,72389,4
72389,Maybe this Holiday :),72389,4
72390,"The bra itself seemed a little small, but worked perfectly for what I needed.",72390,4
72390,Unfortunately I live in Florida and needed it for an outfit I was wearing in the summer.,72390,4
72390,"If you sweat at all, it doesn't stick anymore, that is to be expected though with any sticky type bra.",72390,4
72390,I was able to go to the bathroom and clean it up a bit and it stuck well again after that.,72390,4
72390,"Overall good product, got exactly what I had expected.",72390,4
72391,It looks good but the bra is a little big maybe because I have small back,72391,4
72392,"It's a comfortable, lightweight sweatshirt, which is perfect for cooler weather.",72392,4
72392,"You'll need a coat, or a much heavier sweatshirt if the mercury drops too low.",72392,4
72392,One thing I especially like about this sweatshirt is the pockets are deeper than my more expensive ones.,72392,4
72392,This keeps items much more secure; my phone constantly falls out of the shallow pockets of my GAP/J Crew sweatshirts.,72392,4
72393,This is a good quality item.,72393,4
72393,It's cute and looks like the picture.,72393,4
72393,It is made well and I believe would hold up well.,72393,4
72393,"I'm 5""3"" and weigh 150-wear a size 10 in most skirts/pants and this fits well.",72393,4
72393,"Only problem for me is that rather than looking like a ""pin up girl"" I look like I have my grandmothers panties on.",72393,4
72393,I am returning it.,72393,4
72393,Doesn't work well for my short slightly chubby body!,72393,4
72394,I'm surprised with this product it's great for the price!,72394,4
72394,I've washed it twice and it still looks nice!,72394,4
72395,My son loves it.,72395,4
72395,He says its a good fabric for next to the skin,72395,4
72396,"Good product, The pockets are thin enough to not add unnecessary bulk but thick enough to last.",72396,4
72397,Wouldn't call the color purple...more lilac to me.,72397,4
72397,"So far, I'm very pleased with these socks but I've yet to put them through the test of a wash and dry.",72397,4
72397,I'll update my review if these socks don't hold up.,72397,4
72398,The size was a little smaller than I would like but it works fine with what I'm wearing.,72398,4
72398,The cups inside the fabric are a little weird but not really noticeable.,72398,4
72399,I didn't like how it fit on me and had to give it to a friend.,72399,4
72399,"It fit bigger (wider) than expected, and since the material is not very thin (though a nice soft cotton or blend), it made me look 20lb bigger.",72399,4
72399,Smaller size would not have worked either since the sleeves would be too short on a small.,72399,4
72399,"I am 5'6'', 130 lb.",72399,4
72399,My friend is a few inches shorter and much curvier and it fit nicely on her those should would normally order Large.,72399,4
72400,"It came out reallyyy nice., I loved it!",72400,4
72400,I believe I got a small and I'm a size 5.,72400,4
72400,Took awhile to get here though,72400,4
72401,Size fit a little smaller.,72401,4
72402,I bought Style 1: It is only the over dress part.,72402,4
72402,"not like the model is wearing some high waisted underwear thing, that was not included so do be aware you will need to buy something to wear underneath.",72402,4
72402,I got a plain white romper and it looked amazing over it received tons of complements on my outfit while wearing it at a new years eve party and will wear it again as soon as possible.,72402,4
72403,"I love these shoes, my 5th pair in the last few years and I wear the others out completely.",72403,4
72403,They are perfect for easy walks and slipping on and off quickly for dog walks.,72403,4
72403,"The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that they don't have any arch support to speak of, and take some time to wear in to make them totally comfortable.",72403,4
72403,"But I will always buy them, love the colors.",72403,4
72404,This reminds me of how much I like the movie 'Cars!',72404,4
72405,Cute shoes but my daughter has to wear socks with them.,72405,4
72405,We even tried the footer and that didn't work.,72405,4
72405,The sides rub her foot and cause a blister.,72405,4
72406,"Super cute dress, very soft and comfy but way too big.",72406,4
72406,"I am 5'1, 120 pounds, bought a small and it was like a large.",72406,4
72406,I gave it to a friend and she loves it.,72406,4
72407,Going to use it as a swimsuit coverup,72407,4
72408,Not as good I thought it would be,72408,4
72409,Very cute and nice quality,72409,4
72410,I bought it a little big so he could grow into it.,72410,4
72410,He liked it so much he put it right on and then slept in it.,72410,4
72411,It is just as good if not better than the more expensive trainers I have purchased in the past.,72411,4
72411,I really like the fact that it is lined both inside and out so it does not have that tire feel and strong rubber odor.,72411,4
72411,"My only complaint is that I am only 5'5"" yet this so called ""long torso does not really cover my lower tummy any better than the regular length trainers even though I am a full figured hour glass with a relatively flat tummy.",72411,4
72411,That being said I still consider it a great by and i will be purchasing more as I slim down,72411,4
72412,My grandson loves them!,72412,4
72412,However they are so ventilated you can see through them which is not so great for winter weather.,72412,4
72413,Way too small but cute.,72413,4
72413,Order two sizes up.,72413,4
72414,I didn't think I would like a denim shirt.,72414,4
72414,"The good:
This shirt fits very well.",72414,4
72414,It is very comfortable material.,72414,4
72414,It's not really denim material.,72414,4
72414,"The iffy:
Now I need more pants that aren't jeans.",72414,4
72414,It's not really denim material (which is a good thing..?),72414,4
72414,"Verdict:
I would only ever need one denim shirt.",72414,4
72415,"Arrived to late to wear this year, but will have it for next.",72415,4
72417,It's really really comfortable but since it is a bit large it sags in the front.,72417,4
72417,Due to this fact you can see into the front of the costume.,72417,4
72417,After I wash it if might resolve the issue.,72417,4
72417,Other than that it was a great purchase.,72417,4
72418,I looked at this belt at a local camping store but they did not have the color or size I wanted.,72418,4
72418,"The one I tried on was a medium, black in color and was to big for my 32"" waist.",72418,4
72418,I planed on using the belt with for my CCW (inside waist band) and the belt at the local store was stiff enough to do that.,72418,4
72418,When I received this belt yesterday from Amazon I was surprised that it was not as stiff as the one that I looked at last week in the store.,72418,4
72418,"Now I understand the mixed reviews on how stiff this belt is, I like the belt and will keep the for use when not carrying but will look elsewhere for another CCW belt for summertime use.",72418,4
72421,"Love the stretchy material, fast shipping and super cute dress!",72421,4
72422,print looked amazing and was surprisingly supper soft!,72422,4
72423,I bought this as a swimsuit coverup.,72423,4
72423,"It's pretty much just what you see in the picture, but it looks pretty boxy when I wear it.",72423,4
72423,The waist is dropped so doesn't really work to cinch in.,72423,4
72423,And there's a lot of fabric in the back that bunches up kind of strangely above the drawstring.,72423,4
72423,"It's comfy and easy for swimwear though, so I still like it.",72423,4
72424,"so far, so good, a bit tight on the bridge of the nose, but workable.",72424,4
72424,"I like the amber lens, and the fact that I can read my instrument panel, which I couldn't do with sunglass readers.",72424,4
72424,"So, I am happy!",72424,4
72425,Mine actually came with 2 even though I only ordered one.,72425,4
72425,The quality was kind of bad so it rusted quickly but I they sent me 2 so I couldn't complain.,72425,4
72426,Reviews say it ran small and so I ordered it larger fits well got the 6 months size for my 2 1/2 months baby,72426,4
72427,Fabric fine but is too loose.,72427,4
72428,My Mother is enjoying this necklace,72428,4
72429,This was exactly what I expected.,72429,4
72429,"Only disappointed slightly in the print being a little worn and we haven't even wore them yet, but over all a good value for the money spent.",72429,4
72429,Can't wait to wear them at Disney on our honeymoon coming up!,72429,4
72430,very pleased with this swimsuits fit and look.,72430,4
72431,It fits really well.,72431,4
72431,"However, the gold button broke off the back of mine so I will have to fix it somehow.",72431,4
72432,Got them  for my daughters Halloween costume and they matched perfectly.,72432,4
72432,They only lasted about a day sadly though.,72432,4
72432,"She put a hole in the knee while playing around and from there it was bye bye tights, They made it the night and then were no more.",72432,4
72433,This product is made well and a high quality product.,72433,4
72433,"That being said I am a tall girl 6'2"" size 12 and the one I purchased is made for a much shorter person.",72433,4
72433,When the front is placed under your boobs  it cuts off circulation to your arms or gouges  your chest.,72433,4
72434,Love these boots but they do run 1/2 size small.,72434,4
72434,I ordered a size 10 and they're pretty snug.,72434,4
72434,A 10.5 would have been perfect.,72434,4
72434,"No arch support, so doubt they'd be great for a full day of walking.",72434,4
72434,Perfect for the cold weather and short outings.,72434,4
72435,My wife likes it,72435,4
72437,Very pretty but small,72437,4
72438,"I purchased a small but it fits like a medium to me,but nice breathable material.",72438,4
72439,The color was what was expected and it fit nice.,72439,4
72440,Very neat and well made.,72440,4
72440,It is rather small and paler in color but still nice!,72440,4
72441,Looks exactly as it did in picture.,72441,4
72441,Seeing it on a model would've been helpful though.,72441,4
72442,I ordered this for my teenager for the annual military ball for ROTC.,72442,4
72442,"I had to do quite a bit of alterations for the straps going around the torso, but it was fairly close, all things considered.",72442,4
72442,"It was shipped quite quickly,(but I payed an extra $39 for express shipping) and seller was good about keeping communication with me.",72442,4
72442,"I gave it 4 stars because of all the frayed and un sewn material I had to finish, and the straps that go around the torso were snapped in place by cheap plastic snap buttons that were very small and untrustworthy.",72442,4
72442,I replaced them all with metal slip clasps to make sure the gown stays in place for the evening.,72442,4
72443,"My friend got this crossbody from DSW, but when I went to buy the same one, it was already gone...",72443,4
72443,So this is the only place where it was sold.,72443,4
72443,"It is a little pricey for this size of a purse, and the price isn't competitive at all.",72443,4
72443,"However, I do love the purse!!",72443,4
72443,It just took longer than expected to get shipped to me.,72443,4
72444,"It fits but the whole thing is sewn in such a way that it gives random places, like shoulders and chest, just a little too much fabric.",72444,4
72444,This causes it to appear wrinkled in those spots.,72444,4
72444,The collar also wrinkled up dramatically after washing and air drying.,72444,4
72444,Trying to decide whether to cut it off or not,72444,4
72445,"Great quality, somewhat small.",72445,4
72446,"This skirt is beautiful, nothing wrong with skirt, just me I need to loose weight in my mid section, I wish it come in a bigger size up, I'm 5'6 / 160 lbs , it's my incentive to loose weight, 1 inch and this will fit me, 2 inch it will fit perfect.",72446,4
72447,"Since i'm a small person, i expected it might be large, and i was correct.",72447,4
72447,Washed it in warm water and dried on high; now it fits much better!,72447,4
72447,"But, i still need to roll up the sleeves a bit.",72447,4
72448,Cute once you get them on.,72448,4
72448,I have small legs & they are fine on me but I bought some for gifts that were too tight to wear.,72448,4
72449,I got this in August and I'm only using the bra (and still using it).,72449,4
72449,The panties that came with were just too small so I'll just be reviewing the bra.,72449,4
72449,Also note this is in Asian sizes so you are getting the bra order a size or 2 up!!,72449,4
72449,I'm a 34A so I ordered the 34B of the bra.,72449,4
72449,It fits just fine and looks cute too.,72449,4
72449,Since it is a push up bra it does the job well.,72449,4
72449,It's also nice since you can use this as a strapless bra as welll!,72449,4
72449,The bra is quite comfy to me so that is a plus.,72449,4
72449,"(Although comfort may vary between you and me...) As for the color, it's a bit darker than the photo.",72449,4
72449,Although the color does not change on how cute it looks drastically.,72449,4
72449,It's a good deal for bra if you want something cute and will provide a little help if you aren't well endowed like me.,72449,4
72449,"The only sad thing is that the panties are super small, although expected because of the Asian size.",72449,4
72450,I ordered the gray and the color is beautiful.,72450,4
72450,The 'grippers' on thumbs and Index finger work well.,72450,4
72450,"They do run a tad small and aren't for really cold, harsh weather (not for shoveling snow).",72450,4
72450,"But they are great for walks, running errands, cold waether!",72450,4
72451,Bought them for my son for our Disney World trip coming up.,72451,4
72451,"They pants are a little weird, almost like the blue color was painted on.... or something.",72451,4
72451,"I cant really explain it, but you will see when you get them.",72451,4
72451,I would but again though because the quality is good and they're soft.,72451,4
72452,Really liked the color and the stretchy elastic band.,72452,4
72452,Follow the size chart!,72452,4
72453,Very thin and flimsy.,72453,4
72453,A little large for 3 year olds but they didn't wear them anyway.,72453,4
72453,Just made the themed party more fun to have them.,72453,4
72453,They arrived a day late and the day before the party.,72453,4
72453,The box arrived all smashed in on one side but the hats were easy to pop back in shape,72453,4
72454,Background info: I'm 5'2 and of medium build.,72454,4
72454,"Pros: Came quicker than I expected and I live all in way in New Zealand, packaging was good, when wearing it it came up higher on my thigh than expected (although I am not complaining) so even though it was a tad bit bigger than I expected I am still satisfied with it :), looks exactly how it looks on the picture, the texture is what you would expect it to be.",72454,4
72454,Everyone who has seen me wearing them agrees they're cute!,72454,4
72454,Cons: Rolls down a bit so I have to keep pulling it up but I guess you expect that with most/any thigh highs.,72454,4
72454,(or I probably have thick thighs lol),72454,4
72455,A little small and short.,72455,4
72456,This top fit just as I was expecting it to!,72456,4
72456,"I am size 12 or 14 in jeans (depending on brand, mostly a size 12 though)  and a size medium to large in shirts.",72456,4
72456,I wear a bra size of 36C-D.,72456,4
72456,I am 5'4 and currently 190lbs.,72456,4
72456,I purchased this shirt in a size 12 and it fit very well for me.,72456,4
72456,"Very loose, but not baggy or boxy at all.",72456,4
72456,"Looks dressy, but I will attempt to make it casual.",72456,4
72456,I think I could even go down a size if I wanted a more snug fit.,72456,4
72456,I will wear it a whole day tomorrow and see if it loosens up a bit.,72456,4
72456,"If it does loosen up, than I will repurchase another top one size smaller.",72456,4
72456,I have included pictures.,72456,4
72456,I am curvy but small waisted and I felt this flattered my body type very well.,72456,4
72456,I give it four stars for one reason: my only problem is the white lace that hangs loosely by the armpits.,72456,4
72456,"It looks a bit odd, especially when you are moving your arms up and down.",72456,4
72456,But I can get past this because I love the shirt so much.,72456,4
72456,"Other than that the material feels very nice, not cheap like I was expecting.",72456,4
72456,"Hoping it holds up well once in the wash.

*UPDATE* Very loose after wearing a day and the sleeves are long, I would get a size 10 next in another color.",72456,4
72456,But it still looks good.,72456,4
72456,Very simple to make casual with some jeans and cute booties ;-) I opted to wear a very popping matte lipstick with mine.,72456,4
72456,";-)

If anyone has tips on how they have dealt with the loosely hanging lace by the armpits please let me know.",72456,4
72456,I do not know how to sew so I was thinking of just cutting it off!,72456,4
72457,I bought this for a teenager and she loves it.,72457,4
72458,Love the way there is a small pouch in front for genitalia.,72458,4
72459,The shirt came out cute but it was a little smaller than I anticipated the size to be!,72459,4
72460,They are soft and quite cute.,72460,4
72460,More for the summer use than winters.,72460,4
72462,thinner material and slightly stretchy.,72462,4
72462,"Runs a little small in my opinion, but we like it",72462,4
72463,Shorter than I had expected but super cute all the same.. ordering another color!,72463,4
72464,Small around the arms and chest.,72464,4
72465,There is a big hole in one pocket.,72465,4
72466,I recently purchased these for my 10 year old son and he loves them.,72466,4
72466,He thinks they are super comfortable.,72466,4
72466,My son runs track so fit is very important to him.,72466,4
72466,"Even though he has other sneakers, he wears his Nike Free every day.",72466,4
72466,I guess I will have to buy another pair soon!,72466,4
72467,I'm usually a small for bikini top and medium for the bottom.,72467,4
72467,5'4 waver around 118-120 lbs.,72467,4
72467,I ordered a large since I read all the reviews and guessed 2 sizes up would be fine.,72467,4
72467,The prints are beautiful.,72467,4
72467,The material is pretty sturdy.,72467,4
72467,The only thing I had a problem with is.. it's not long enough.,72467,4
72467,Being it's a 1 piece I feel like stuffed up when I tied the neck strings up.,72467,4
72467,Other than that my buttocks are pretty covered.,72467,4
72467,There are boobage padding but if you have the same problem as me then you might have to adjust that part.,72467,4
72468,I have order a size 8 1/2 and that's what the shoe  size is but to me is 1/2 size bigger.,72468,4
72468,Other than that I like my new shoes.,72468,4
72469,"I liked the shirt a lot but it was a little tight and you could see my bra through it so I gave it to my little brother and he loves it, he thinks it's the coolest thing ever.",72469,4
72469,The material is really nice and soft and the Alien is really good too.,72469,4
72469,"It looks amazing, but it was just a little small for me.",72469,4
72470,"I feel sorry for the little girl in the photo, but I like it on my daughter.",72470,4
72471,Nice strong diaper bag but quite expensive relative to some bags I've seen since buying this.,72471,4
72471,"Nonetheless, my husband is happy with it.",72471,4
72472,"For the price, they are fine.",72472,4
72472,The materials are cheap plastic but they are rugged and durable; I don't feel like either the tag or loop are likely to break from being thrown around.,72472,4
72472,"The plastic loop is attached by plastic nubs on a strip stuck through holes on the other side of the strip, and it has good staying power but can be easily undone compared to other luggage tags.",72472,4
72472,"After a good bit of use I've found that the weak spot is that the plastic loops will pop undone every once in awhile if you catch a tag at an odd angle under something heavy, like another piece of luggage, and pry the loop at an odd angle while trying to pick up your luggage out of a pile.",72472,4
72472,"It's not a frequent issue but has happened to me twice now, no damage to the tag/loop though.",72472,4
72472,"Another downside is that the paper inserts are not protected from rain, which could get to be a pain if you travel a lot.",72472,4
72472,"But if you don't mind the risk of one getting lost or ruined, you get 20 of them.",72472,4
72472,"And the bright green is nice, true to color in the picture.",72472,4
72473,Not as snug as I would have liked.,72473,4
72474,I wasn't sure about how this tunic was going to look but I was very pleased when I saw it in person.,72474,4
72474,The fabrics have more color variety than seen in the picture and it is a very lovely fit and flattering shape.,72474,4
72474,"The fabric is soft and comfortable, but also quite delicate.",72474,4
72474,The black rosette section is interesting in how it was made (torn fabric over a solid fabric) but I am concerned about how it will hold up over time.,72474,4
72474,This is a very lovely but very delicate tunic that needs to be cared for.,72474,4
72474,I fear I will only be able to wear it for special occasions.,72474,4
72476,My 3 year old is in pre-k and he LOVES it.,72476,4
72476,"As other reviews mention the print is ""shiny"" but it certainly does not take away from the product at all.",72476,4
72476,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the lunch box is not very deep.,72476,4
72476,"The product description does give the dimensions, so yes it's my fault for not realizing, but I bought the Mickey thermos to match and it doesn't fit in the lunch box well at all especially with all the other items that go into the lunch (snacks, juice box, ice pack, etc.)",72476,4
72477,It's a nice swim shirt but o bit on the thin side.,72477,4
72477,Maybe it's because it's white.,72477,4
72477,Wish it was a bit thicker fabric.,72477,4
72477,"My 8yr old daughter likes to wear these without anything under but for this item, she needs too.",72477,4
72478,"Bought to give to my granddaughter, very cute, I think she will love it.",72478,4
72480,"This brand truly does run very small, but that's great news for me because I'm 5'1 and 97lbs!",72480,4
72480,So it's usually very difficult for me to find rompers/jumpsuits.,72480,4
72480,This one is perfect!!,72480,4
72480,"The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's I have a small chest, and the romper runs small everywhere except there!",72480,4
72480,"But if you adjust the straps and use some breast tape, it's perfect!",72480,4
72482,"This cover up is very ""mod"" looking to me, but I love it.",72482,4
72482,"The sleeve are an odd length on my arms, but if you push them up to your elbows it looks great.",72482,4
72482,"Also, I think this would look greta with a tank underneath and some jeans.",72482,4
72483,"Totally cute and wearable, the only thing is it's obviously fake and is slightly too big.",72483,4
72483,But it's still super adorable.,72483,4
72484,Asian sizes fit differently.,72484,4
72484,"I wear this ""dress"" as a shirt/tunic.",72484,4
72484,I COULD wear it as a dress but it would be very short!,72484,4
72484,"It is very cute though, I have had many compliments on it!",72484,4
72485,Fits good and has a nice material on the inside feels nice on my head.,72485,4
72486,"I am 5'5"", 34DD bust, and I wear a size 6 or 8 or medium dress, large if it's juniors.",72486,4
72486,I bought the L and it fit great everywhere but the bust.,72486,4
72486,"Still, it's doable, just a tad snug and it rides up a little at the bust.",72486,4
72486,"An XL would have been way too big everywhere else, so I'll experiment with different bras and/or cardigans because it's a really cute dress and WAY cheap!",72486,4
72486,"If I were younger I'd go with bare legs, but I'll stick with leggings and boots at 43. :)",72486,4
72487,It's a cute jacket but the sleeves are too long but other that great jacket Nice material,72487,4
72488,Love the size and the fact I can use as wristlet or cross body.,72488,4
72488,Fit in my laptop bag so I don't have to carry two bags.,72488,4
72488,Material is soft which was a concern.,72488,4
72488,"Fits all my ""to go"" necessities including my phone.",72488,4
72488,Chose the red and I'm not disappointed!,72488,4
72488,Came in a cute box too.,72488,4
72489,I like this shoe!!,72489,4
72489,There is no arch support like the Vionic Tide II SANDAL ...,72489,4
72489,"This is good , but not quite as good as the Tide sandals ..",72489,4
72491,Cute for the price.,72491,4
72491,Order a size up because it does run small.,72491,4
72491,The bottoms were more of a pinkish color.,72491,4
72492,could use more room in front,72492,4
72493,Perfect size for a carry on.,72493,4
72493,"Does it shrink the size of the shirts, yes.",72493,4
72493,"Does it make it amazingly thin, no.",72493,4
72493,It does make it easier to pack and you might be able to get 1-2 extra garments in.,72493,4
72495,sexy but a bit small,72495,4
72496,Love these... Only thing is!!!,72496,4
72496,It's smaller than I thought it would have been.,72496,4
72497,These are very nice gloves that are well made.,72497,4
72497,Sturdier and heavier that the ones from the dollar store.,72497,4
72497,I'm very happy with them.,72497,4
72497,"I would give these 5 stars but they took a long time to get here..slow boat from China, and there was no mention of that anywhere on the page that I could find.",72497,4
72497,"I would still recommend these, just order ahead of time.",72497,4
72499,Top is beautiful bottoms is to tight around stomach area beware,72499,4
72501,Did not come as shown on the picture.,72501,4
72501,I'm normally a medium but I ordered an large based off the feedback.,72501,4
72501,You still get the lace and color but it's not as loose as it shows on the photo.,72501,4
72501,It's form fitted on me.,72501,4
72501,I do like the shirt a lot but I would say to order two times larger if you want it loose and order it one time larger if you wanted it fitted.,72501,4
72502,I love this item but it did annoy me that one i got stretched to a 2 gauge/6mm there was no 7mm/1gauge so i had to buy one but besides for that i def recommend buying this just make sure u order a 7mm gauge with it all the other sizes r there,72502,4
72503,The only bad thing is it doesn't keep time very well.,72503,4
72503,A weeks time goes by and its 7-10min fast,72503,4
72504,I chose a size 10 based on the comments.,72504,4
72504,"I should have chosen an 8. great dress, and well made .",72504,4
72505,Fit was nice and not super teeny tiny at the waistline.,72505,4
72505,They were comfortable to wear all night.,72505,4
72505,"Careful when you pull them on though, the fishnet can move like out of place and look a little wonky.",72505,4
72506,I received this outfit in a large.,72506,4
72506,"It was somewhat tighter than I thought, but is ok to wear.",72506,4
72506,It is very thin and light weight and long.,72506,4
72507,I really like them but the top is tight and doesn't really fit my thighs.,72507,4
72507,And when I walk they roll down,72507,4
72508,Everyone complimented my little girl on Halloween!,72508,4
72509,Great shirt for everyday wear.,72509,4
72509,Make sure to order a size up if you are fuller through the bust.,72509,4
72509,I am ordering another.,72509,4
72510,The purse is beautiful and the right size but the zipper keeps coming apart.,72510,4
72510,"***UPDATE: 06/17/16-The company contacted me and has offered to replace the purse, which is terrific.",72510,4
72510,I will update this review once I receive the replacement.,72510,4
72510,"07/07/16
My replacement purse came in and I find that highly commendable.",72510,4
72510,"I have updated the stars to four because they sent me another purse, which shows excellent customer service.",72510,4
72511,I like it but thank goodness I ordered up a size.,72511,4
72511,I have a few of these blouses (from different brand) in medium and they are longer in the torso area which is the way I prefer them.,72511,4
72511,"These are more fitted and only sit right at the top of my pants/skirt which means that if they shrink, my belly may show and I'm too old to be showing mid-drift.",72511,4
72511,I am taller though so maybe that's why.,72511,4
72511,I ordered Large in these and they fit like a small/medium as far as length goes.,72511,4
72511,I don't mind them being a bit fitted though because they look cute that way but they are fitted.,72511,4
72511,I ordered two of these in white and gray.,72511,4
72511,I have not washed them yet but I plan to hand wash and hang dry because I don't see these being able to withstand a washer and dryer.,72511,4
72511,The gray looks nice.,72511,4
72512,a bit tight on neck,72512,4
72513,"The size did fit just right, but it wasn't as long and baggy as it appears in the picture.",72513,4
72513,"It is a pretty gray cardigan though, and I do still wear it.",72513,4
72514,I like it alot!!!,72514,4
72514,it's very comfortable and soft but the only thing is that I thought it would be Red but is actually as many people say on the reviews Orange anyway it's really nice.,72514,4
72515,Feels really light and cheap.,72515,4
72515,I had to peel some excess glue off.,72515,4
72515,You get what you pay for.,72515,4
72516,Very cute suit for a little one.,72516,4
72516,Fit well with swim diaper on.,72516,4
72517,Helps baby walk on wood and tile floor,72517,4
72518,"The arm hole are a little tiny bit close together, but still comfy once you get it on.",72518,4
72519,"A wee bit small, but okay since they are stretch material.",72519,4
72519,"After I had ordered them, it dawned on me - they are coming from China!",72519,4
72519,"I ordered a Large, but was 100% positive they would be way to small for me and completely unwearable.",72519,4
72519,"They are very wearable, I will use them with large sweaters and tunics and boots because they are tight, but that's exactly what I had planned anyway.",72519,4
72520,Hard to find hat is great!,72520,4
72521,"This ""Bring It"" tee has met all my expectations.",72521,4
72521,"Good quality, even
the lettering seems to be of good quality.",72521,4
72521,Only time will truly tell.,72521,4
72521,A little slow in delivery but definitely far from the worst.,72521,4
72522,This don't fit properly.,72522,4
72522,"The top of the socks are longer than the bottom, so the front of the sock goes up your leg higher than the back.",72522,4
72522,Plus it feels strange.,72522,4
72522,Mine are poorly made.,72522,4
72522,Customer service contacted me immediately and gave me a full refund without me having to send them back!,72522,4
72523,DD boobs don't fit at all.,72523,4
72523,Super cute though and good quality if u have small boobs,72523,4
72524,I purchased the set of 3 gold Huggies because I wanted the largest hoop to wear as my everyday earring.,72524,4
72524,"When they arrived, I found 2 of the smaller hoops had fallen out of the spongy slot but they were not damaged.",72524,4
72524,I immediately knew that any hopes I had that the medium size hoops may also work for me went out the window.,72524,4
72524,They were too small for my taste.,72524,4
72524,"Nonetheless, I was happy to get a pair that I could wear after spending around $10.",72524,4
72524,The curved stem of the Huggies is indeed a bit harder to put on than straight ones but itr wasn't too bad.,72524,4
72524,My left ear piercing is a bit lower than the right one and a bit enlarged as well so the huggie doesn't hang as pretty as the right ear.,72524,4
72524,I found the weight of the 16mm huggies to be quite satisfactory.,72524,4
72524,The comfort with huggies is above most other styles of earrings.,72524,4
72524,I don't like to switch out my jewelry on a daily basis.,72524,4
72524,"I also like to wear them in the shower, swimming, sleeping, talking on the phone, etc.",72524,4
72524,"So, comfort is of utmost importance.",72524,4
72524,These pass the test with the exception of swimming.,72524,4
72524,I haven't done that yet.,72524,4
72524,I hope someone who has worn them in the pool will let me know how they hold up.,72524,4
72524,My only complaint is that the inside of the hoop isn't polished like the outside because you can see the inner hoop very easily when wearing the 16 mm one.,72524,4
72525,"Quite long, and longer in back than front which isn't visible in stock pic.",72525,4
72525,Nice drape and ruffles.,72525,4
72525,Works as a stand alone and as an extender layer.,72525,4
72525,Love that the straps are regular tank not spaghetti.,72525,4
72525,"Even for loose-fit I would buy true to size, I sized up which is okay but bigger than necessary.",72525,4
72526,Purchased on lighting deal.,72526,4
72526,Nice bag for sure.,72526,4
72526,"Large, light and roomy.",72526,4
72526,The hook can be difficult but I managed.,72526,4
72527,"First off, this took me about 10 minutes to figure out how to wear it!",72527,4
72527,"Once I figured it out though, it's a great fit!",72527,4
72527,Im about 5'2 125lbs and I got a large and it fits perfectly!,72527,4
72527,Material isn't thick like a sweater but it feels really nice.,72527,4
72527,The fringes look kinda weird too but overall it's great!,72527,4
72528,love the quality and print need a better choice of sizes,72528,4
72529,"I ordered half sleeve, but received long sleeve.",72529,4
72529,"I needed it quickly for Halloween, and it's not a disaster, but just be wary that you might get the wrong sleeve length.",72529,4
72530,Colorful - just right for a little girl.,72530,4
72531,They run quite large but cute!,72531,4
72532,I was worried I would fall out the bottom but it is SO handy with the butterfly opening!,72532,4
72532,I am buying another!,72532,4
72533,Fits great and looks good.,72533,4
72534,This dress runs small and material is very thin.,72534,4
72534,When it arrived it was moist.,72534,4
72534,They must have dyed it right before packaging it up.,72534,4
72534,"It was the color as shown, but expect some variation in where the dark blue and light blue begin and stop.",72534,4
72534,"Its too thin for me to wear as a dress, but I'll use it as a nightie to wear around the house now that fall is here and its getting a bit chilly.",72534,4
72535,"Love the color and more importantly, I love the fact it doesn't ride up, now I don't pull down like I used to with the Hanes' boxers, haha!",72535,4
72536,I wore this for prom and its very well made.,72536,4
72536,I got the smallest size and im 5'3 100lbs and im a c cup.,72536,4
72536,"The bodice could have been a little smaller but all in all, very nice dress.",72536,4
72536,I wore it with 2.5 inch heels and didn't need to get it tailored.,72536,4
72538,"Took others advice and ordered a size bigger than my child is in, fit perfectly, the shadows did have a tendency unsnap but outfit was adorable and very comfortable for my child.",72538,4
72538,Would recommend and order again if needed.,72538,4
72538,I only have four stars due to sizing isn't accurate.,72538,4
72539,I got a S/M(8-10) and it is a bit too small.,72539,4
72539,"The collar rides way too close to my neck, and I hate that feeling so I cut a V into mine.",72539,4
72539,"Otherwise, I love the product!",72539,4
72540,Wish there were more colors;  runs quite a bit large so reordered in a smaller size,72540,4
72541,"to be overly critical, when the wipe and glass case (cloth) are included in this case, it can seem a little snug.",72541,4
72541,"however, other than that, perfect fit",72541,4
72542,These are pretty cute and I love The decent size pockets.,72542,4
72542,"However, I ordered an extra large and  when they arrived, I had to double-check that I had not ordered a children's size.",72542,4
72542,"I ended up trying them on anyway, and to my surprise they did stretch out but they were still much smaller/shorter than I prefer.",72542,4
72542,"Order a size up if you can, and enjoy.",72542,4
72543,Expected these to be slouchy and they aren't.,72543,4
72543,Great product other than the description made me think they would have more slouch to the back of the beenie.,72543,4
72543,Color and texture are great.,72543,4
72544,Good fabric with fair price,72544,4
72545,I'm usually a small but reading the reviews I ordered a size up.,72545,4
72545,It looks really cute and I get a lot of compliments.,72545,4
72545,I'm a 32 D so a little snug in the boobs but overall really cute romper!,72545,4
72546,I'm 5'1 139lbs and a 34ddd.,72546,4
72546,However I did knock off a star because the included belt is waaaaaaayyyy to small to achieve the look in the picture.,72546,4
72547,My niece really likes it,72547,4
72548,I gave the watch 4 stars because the face of the watch is really big on my small wrist.,72548,4
72548,I love the stylish look it arrived un damaged and packed well.,72548,4
72548,However it took a very long time to receive it.,72548,4
72548,That's why I rated it only 4 stars.,72548,4
72549,Very fancy and sparkly dress.,72549,4
72549,It's a great deal for the price!,72549,4
72549,"Only small problem is,  the sequins make me a bit itchy when wearing it.",72549,4
72549,Other than that the dress is very pretty.,72549,4
72549,Definitely made to wear to a fancy event!,72549,4
72550,You can't be shy to wear this!,72550,4
72551,I really like this hat and its white color.,72551,4
72551,I took away one star because of the annoying tag that I tried to cut off.,72551,4
72551,It's very soft and warm.,72551,4
72552,"First off, I love these leggings!",72552,4
72552,Love the little pocket and get a bunch of compliments on them...,72552,4
72552,So much so that I have like 10 pairs!,72552,4
72552,"Why I took off a star... Well first off they won't last you forever (but at this price point I wasn't expecting them to, and that said I use them for Crossfit and they are holding up better than I thought they would).",72552,4
72552,The other and probably bigger reason I'm taking off a star is that not all patterns are the same quality...,72552,4
72552,Some patterns look like they were enlarged too much and come off looking blurry while others look great.,72552,4
72552,I would steer clear of the Game of Thrones ones with the family crests.,72552,4
72552,The owl ones along with Tetris and Pac-Man are amoung my faves!,72552,4
72552,Anyway super cute way to spice up your gym time :),72552,4
72553,"Great look, especially for price!",72553,4
72553,A little wide for a smaller face.,72553,4
72554,Got this for my son who decided it wasn't fair for his sisters to leave the bathroom with robes when he didn't possess one.,72554,4
72554,I couldn't believe how hard it was to find a boys robe!,72554,4
72554,He loved this one.,72554,4
72554,It is soft and warm and the slippers were an added bonus.,72554,4
72554,Looks like the pic and has held up through 2 washes thus far.,72554,4
72554,He is a big boy for 9 and hates for things to be tight so we went with a size 12-14 which was a little big in the arms (we rolled them up and they were fine) but perfect around his torso and long enough to hit mid calf on his long legs so I would say the fit is what you would expect by the size chart.,72554,4
72555,They are definitely a good deal,72555,4
72556,I sent in my custom measurements & the dress fit well in all but length.,72556,4
72556,"It was longer than I expected it to be, but  with a little tailoring, it was an easy fix.",72556,4
72556,I also found the material on the shoulders to be a little scratchy for my liking.,72556,4
72556,"I can't really complain too much, though.",72556,4
72556,It was beautiful and looked exactly like I wanted it to.,72556,4
72557,"good quality product, like them all",72557,4
72558,My son absolutely loves the Vans that I bought him for his birthday.,72558,4
72558,The white canvas is extremely stylish and cleans relatively easily.,72558,4
72558,There have been no complaints of discomfort when wearing the shoes and the slip on design is very well made.,72558,4
72558,The only reason I have given this a 4 star ration is due to the sole of the right shoe tearing after 4 months of wear.,72558,4
72558,This should be expected when you wear a pair of shoes everyday though.,72558,4
72558,Overall the shoes hold up very well and compliment any outfit.,72558,4
72559,Personally not fond of the material it's scratchy and almost itchy.,72559,4
72559,I thought it was going to be like a silkier feel.,72559,4
72559,I'm a size us small/medium so I got the large since they were out of medium and it's pretty big but doable since it's meant to be baggy.,72559,4
72559,Arrived a lot sooner than exspected though,72559,4
72560,I RE-PURCHASED THE PRODUCT BECAUSE SOMEONE LIKED IT ON ME AND I BROUGHT IT FOR THEM,72560,4
72561,"My daughter love this item....I purchased it for her for Halloween unfortunately she didn't get a chance to wear it because she got sick so I didn't get a picture of her in it but since it is an nice shirt she don't have to wear just for Halloween, so great multipurpose shirt.",72561,4
72561,My daughter normally wears a size 8 in shirts so I got a medium wish I had got a large though.,72561,4
72561,So if you purchase this item be sure to go up a size,72561,4
72563,I get so many compliments on this dress.,72563,4
72563,It is soft and comfortable.,72563,4
72563,I did notice the hem is coming loose on the bottom and I've only washed it twice.,72563,4
72563,That is a concern.,72563,4
72563,Other than that I love this dress.,72563,4
72564,"It will work for what I need it for, but I have the adjustable strap on the last (largest) hole.",72564,4
72564,"I have a 7 5/8 hat size, by the way.",72564,4
72565,I really like this waist cincher/ shaper.,72565,4
72565,After being skeptical for about 2+ years I decided to buy because the price is reasonable and based on reviews.,72565,4
72565,"I would have kindly given 5 stars however, I purchased the medium and maybe could have even done a small.",72565,4
72565,"Based on the measurement table provided I purchased the medium however, I was immediately able to go to the second and third hooks on day one and two!",72565,4
72565,It does improve posture as it will cause discomfort if you bend over a lot on one side aka slouching.,72565,4
72565,Other than that...great purchase and will definitely get another one and intend to buy a few for gifts.,72565,4
72566,I love these jeans!,72566,4
72566,"They are just a little baggy, but that is probably because I am in-between sizes.",72566,4
72566,"Despite that, they are perfect!",72566,4
72566,"I love that they make ""jeans"" feel feminine.",72566,4
72566,The only kind I will wear from now on!,72566,4
72567,Cute for the price,72567,4
72569,It came still a lil small even for a XL but I'll manage.,72569,4
72569,It Keeps me warm which I'm surprised about when it's cold so you could say it ain't like most other hoodies,72569,4
72570,"this was a great pair of fun sneakers but the left side light was on for one day, second full wear no lights - disappointed",72570,4
72571,"Just as described, good fit, good jeans.",72571,4
72573,It was very pretty.,72573,4
72573,I bought it for my 4 year old daughter and she loved it!,72573,4
72574,I am 5'3 weigh about 120 lbs and use either a size 0 or 2 for bottoms.,72574,4
72574,I ordered a small and this product fit perfectly all around and almost touches the floor so length is good too.,72574,4
72574,"The skirt looks like the image and is somewhat see through as I expected since most white fabrics are, with black booty shorts it looks fine though.",72574,4
72574,"The only reason the item did not reach 5 stars is because the material is somewhat thin, but for the price I think it was an all around great purchase.",72574,4
72574,I've included pictures with heels on and without to help show length.,72574,4
72574,Item arrived on time and I had no issues with the seller.,72574,4
72574,"I needed a white skirt in this style and couldn't find it anywhere else since I live in New England and it's cold at this time, I plan to use the item for New Year's Eve on a beach so I think the style is perfect!",72574,4
72575,This was a gift for my daughter...she loved the feel and comfort of the material!,72575,4
72576,My daughter enjoys this and it looks great on her.,72576,4
72576,"She does not like that the flannel is not stretchy, but overall it looks and feelsgood.",72576,4
72577,It fits to the body but stretches,72577,4
72578,Am missing the string to around my neck but I love it,72578,4
72579,Nice quality ... worth d price,72579,4
72580,This shirt fits a little small.,72580,4
72580,Doesn't fit as long as it seems like it would from the picture.,72580,4
72580,But it's soft and comfy,72580,4
72581,Is small but I loved,72581,4
72582,Fit everything perfect and was easy to pull around.,72582,4
72582,Fit in the overhead compartment on the with no problem.,72582,4
72582,Very good bag for the money.,72582,4
72584,"It is a fashion marvel and oddity: usually the stretchy fabric is very clingy, but this shirt is not clingy at all.",72584,4
72584,I don't think complete strangers would stop me to tell me how pretty it is - that would be WEIRD - but I hope one or two of my co-workers will say it's nice.,72584,4
72584,My ONE issue with this shirt is that the pink floral overlay is split in the back.,72584,4
72584,"If you have an ample rear area, the split becomes wider, making it appear that you are stretching the shirt to capacity, when of course, you aren't because it's a stretchy shirt.",72584,4
72584,I bought a 2X and it fits perfectly - a 3X would have been too big  in the arms and chest areas.,72584,4
72584,"I like this Allegra item and would probably buy more of their shirts, but I HOPE they consider the design flaw of this very pretty shirt.",72584,4
72584,"By the way, I washed it in cold water and hung it to dry on a padded hanger (to avoid what my daughter calls ""shoulder nipples"" in the shirt) and it dried over night.",72584,4
72585,Looks bigger on the website,72585,4
72586,"I wanted a good sun hat for my trip to Cancun that was inexpensive, because I knew it would suffer some abuse.",72586,4
72586,"This one did the job perfectly, and looked good doing it.",72586,4
72587,These are cute but the lenses are a little too close together for me.,72587,4
72587,Maybe they're better for people with smaller faces.,72587,4
72588,I love these and have them in many colors.,72588,4
72588,"The length is great for avoiding ""panty peek"".",72588,4
72588,"They would be perfect if they would buff up the thickness and quality of the straps and attach them better to the cami; like other reviewers, I've had to reattach some.",72588,4
72588,They hold up to washing and drying well.,72588,4
72589,They fit as described.,72589,4
72589,"I like them but did not give 5 stars because though they look like driving gloves, the surface is too smooth for gripping the wheel.",72589,4
72590,Little in the back but we can hide that with a sweater or shrug.,72590,4
72592,"These are fine gloves for the cost, they're the same thing you will get at a dollar store or a walmart.",72592,4
72592,I didn't try the touch screen fingers because i cut the fingers off for fingerless gloves.,72592,4
72592,"The material frayed a bit as these budget knit gloves usually do but not too much, and stayed fairly intact.",72592,4
72592,"They are warm enough for light chill, but i don't recommend using them for winter sports or long periods of cold weather.",72592,4
72593,"Great deal (I got mine for $25), and it's comfy, but thin so it's good for So Cal area.",72593,4
72593,The bottom came oddly large (broader than the shoulders) so we're gonna run an elastic band through the hollow base so it fits better.,72593,4
72593,Not a bad purchase for the price though!,72593,4
72594,We did receive this belt is size 40-42 and the student it was ordered for is happy with it.,72594,4
72594,"However, as I indicated in my previous comment, I also ordered 2 of the size 34-36 and only ordered one of them.",72594,4

72596,Brim is very large and floppy.,72596,4

72599,Probably going to order in a bigger size/ different color.,72599,4

72600,Seems to be holding up ok.,72600,4
72601,Too small for my 12 month old grand daughter.,72601,4

72607,The quality is good but it runs too small... the legs are fine it's more the hips that were an issue for me.,72607,4
72608,Runs quite small - I gave to someone else who is a misses XL and it looks nice on them.,72608,4

72621,I LOVED the fabric and colors and feel of this dress.,72621,4

72622,"Nice long sleeves, the leather is soft.",72622,4
72622,Super cool looking but the fit is off.,72622,4

72660,It is a little tight around the thighs/leg opening though.,72660,4
72660,I have a hard time getting the last snap closed near the bottom when putting it on.,72660,4
72660,He is uncomfortable as I'm putting it on but acts fine once its on.,72660,4
72660,We have had one poop incident which was held in perfectly.,72660,4
72660,I do have to admit I wish I had gotten a swim diaper with snaps or velcro on both sides though.,72660,4
72660,Clean up with snaps on one side and a tight fight around the other thigh was a bit of a nightmare.,72660,4
72660,It was a tag team clean up with my husband.,72660,4
72661,Finding fire fighter jewelry for women is almost impossible.,72661,4
72661,"I've wanted a charm for my pandora bracelet for a long time, and I couldn't find one I like.",72661,4
72661,The design of it is great and it fit my pandora just fine.,72661,4

72662,Unique style a hit,72662,4
72664,great for working out.,72664,4
72667,Some issues with the finger print reading through the membrane.,72667,4

72668,The elastic was a bit too tight for me  but I suffer from a lot of migraines and stuff and pressure on my head is never a good thing.,72668,4
72668,The bill is not as nice as the other hat that I got as far as holding its shape  The bill on this hat is a lot floppier.,72668,4
72668,And I wish it came and brighter colors say red purple blue,72668,4
72669,This is more white than pictured.,72669,4
72669,"However,  it's still very pretty.",72669,4
72669,"Also, it's lined so it's not transparent which I was concerned about when I ordered it.",72669,4
72669,This maxi dress is hides all my 3x flaws yet doesn't fit like a shapeless sack or caftan so I am quite pleased.,72669,4
72670,I have two of these shirts.,72670,4
72670,The thing to keep and eye out for is possible rust stains from the straight pins used to hold the shirt in place in the packaging.,72670,4
72670,"The stains are pretty small of course, but on the khaki shirt, they were noticeable on the shoulders.",72670,4
72670,The ones around the waist were not as big and got tucked in.,72670,4

72670,"I am going to get at least one more, but now I know to look at all the pins in the packaging.",72670,4
72672,Like the design and fit,72672,4
72673,I'm 5'3 115 lbs and the small was a little too big but still love it,72673,4
72674,I got medium in a woman's size 71/2-8 and they fit just right (snug like I like them) but the textured bottom hurts the side of my foot.,72674,4
72674,I'd get these in a size bigger to avoid this,72674,4
72675,"Beautiful piece of jewelry, just the right size to not be obnoxious.",72675,4
72675,"However, I cannot give 5 stars.",72675,4
72675,"The clicker bar is extremely flimsy, so it's really hard to get in your nse.",72675,4
72675,"The bar is also extremely hard to unclick, making getting it out of your nose almost painful.",72675,4
72676,"Looks great, lots of room for my usual carry on during flight.",72676,4
72676,Fits under the plane seat and I can get my stuff easily without waiting for seatbelt sign to turn off.,72676,4
72676,I would have given it 5 star if it has a 4 wheels for easier manuever.,72676,4
72677,They were quite a bit larger than a size 12 should be.,72677,4
72677,She will grow into them so the shoe is OK.  Just had to get her another pair.,72677,4
72678,"it is very soft:) I wash and dry this pajama separately, because it sheds fuzz.",72678,4
72679,I like the suit .. it just fits a bit looser then I would like on top.,72679,4
72679,I like my girls to feel secure.,72679,4
72680,"Great quality but way to small, I did contact the seller and they said they will ship a larger size.",72680,4
72680,So excited for that to come in ;),72680,4
72681,I bought the wrong size.,72681,4
72681,I like the dress but I think the medium would have fit me better.,72681,4
72681,I wish I could exchange it.,72681,4
72682,Bought this for my 5 year old niece.,72682,4
72682,Danced around the room and sang the mermaids song.,72682,4
72683,The problem I had with this top was the straps are not proportioned to the size of the Cami.,72683,4
72683,"They are to long, so I had to shorten them.",72683,4
72684,I don't think the company was responsible for the delay so I am not docking points for that.,72684,4
72684,Hat fits well and shades me from the sun.,72684,4
72684,Is lightweight and flexible.,72684,4
72685,Wore this in a costume wedding.,72685,4
72685,It was perfect for the job.,72685,4
72685,"By the end of the night, some of the embellishments were starting to loosen, one may have even fallen off.",72685,4
72685,"Easy to fix, if I wear it again.",72685,4
72685,The fit is easily adjusted via the bustier lace.,72685,4
72686,"I wouldn't dry esp on high heat bc the shirt fits pretty much right on before it's washed so if it's shrunk a little it would probably still be ok but they are not much more long than compared to normal and where your avg size should be just would not want them to get it to shrink on me, lol, considering I'm six foot six.",72686,4
72686,Great heavy cotton & very soft.,72686,4
72686,I love Koloa clothes!,72686,4
72687,"Fits a little loose but maybe that's because I'm 4""11 and weigh 98 pounds.",72687,4
72688,"Cute dress, fits well, and the material is not see through.",72688,4
72688,"The skirt's fabric started to pill a little after a few washes, but not too bad.",72688,4
72689,"It's good but honestly it's tricky to get your stuff out, maybe bc I have too many cards in it.",72689,4
72689,"The old broccoli rubber band, maffia style is still the best wallet IMHO.",72689,4
72690,"With a 38"" chest and a 30"" waist, the medium is a little tight at the top and just right at the bottom.",72690,4
72690,Its not so bad that it compromises your range of motion or anything.,72690,4
72690,"If I had it to do over again, Id probably go for a large, but Im pretty happy with what Ive got.",72690,4
72691,Make sure you order the correct size.,72691,4
72691,WAIST SIZE IS NOT BELT SIZE.,72691,4
72691,Order a size or two bigger then your waist size.,72691,4
72691,Had to give it to my wife.,72691,4
72692,It looks very cute on!,72692,4
72693,"Very vibrant blue, not quite the subtle navy color.",72693,4
72693,"But overall, adorable dress that isn't too heavy and doesn't itch to wear!",72693,4
72693,The neckline looks better on a person than it does in the picture.,72693,4
72694,its a little on the small side but I did lose a little weight so I got the size I needed.,72694,4
72694,I did not get the belt for it and was wondering if I can be sent the belt for no extra charge.,72694,4
72695,Cheaper metal but so pretty for the price and arrived a little earlier then expected,72695,4
72696,The dress for good but I thought it would be better quality,72696,4
72698,I got a lot of compliments when I wore it.,72698,4
72698,The lining makes it wearable as a jacket or a crop top.,72698,4
72699,I really liked it but I may need to get a larger compartment.,72699,4
72701,"A little thin, but otherwise okay.",72701,4
72702,"Not some spectacular quality shirt, but definitely a cute buy.",72702,4
72702,The pink color is really pretty in person and it's a good quality for the price.,72702,4
72702,Thinking of buying other colors!,72702,4
72703,A little snug on the calves.,72703,4
72704,"the shoulders fall off a bit, but fits fairly comfortable",72704,4
72706,Really pretty but one sided t-shirt material.,72706,4
72706,I expected it to be more like a traditional bandana.,72706,4
72706,More of a burgundy color and oversized.,72706,4
72706,Very feminine and love the roses,72706,4
72707,The pants were a little small waist wise and a bout 2 inches too long,72707,4
72708,I only gave it 4 stars because the chain stared to fade and made my neck green but the heart and the thing around it are great the color is still there,72708,4
72709,"Little small, but I like it anyway.",72709,4
72709,If only it was a couple of inches bigger.,72709,4
72709,(That's what she said...)  :P,72709,4
72710,It's a bit too chunky to fit comfortably into my pockets - coat or pants - and there's more card slots than strictly necessary.,72710,4
72710,"But it definitely is leather, seems durable, and I appreciate the RFID blocking tech.",72710,4
72710,"(havent tested that, I'm taking their word for it)
If I could find this same wallet in a smaller size, I think I'd like that more.",72710,4
72712,The only problem is the 1/3 ct weight.,72712,4
72712,The ear rings diamond are barely seen.,72712,4
72712,The stone is very small for the money.,72712,4
72712,Go for a larger carat weight.,72712,4
72713,I bought these for my husband and he hasn't worn another brand since!,72713,4
72713,These are the best!,72713,4
72713,Fit seems to be perfect!,72713,4
72714,These are small but they are a undershirt for me and they are great in the Florida heat.,72714,4
72715,"The top fit perfect, but the bottom was way too small.",72715,4
72715,Had to go up a size (to the largest size) and then still had to let out the sides of the bottom with my sewing machine to get it to fit.,72715,4
72715,"I don't have a huge bottom, I just do squats!",72715,4
72715,Definitely had too small of a bottom piece compared to the top.,72715,4
72715,I wear a 34C and bought a Medium.,72715,4
72715,"Had to buy a Large, but had to keep both so I could wear the Medium top.",72715,4
72715,"Other than that, it's adorable and I get lots of compliments every time I wear it!",72715,4
72717,"I bought them too big for my little one, so I will have to update my review as he grows into them.",72717,4
72718,Great product but I had to return it because it was too tight to be comfortable for me.,72718,4
72719,Was too big for my 3 month old but good quality.,72719,4
72719,He'll fit in it eventually.,72719,4
72720,"I love this dress, I wish it was a bit different.",72720,4
72720,There is no half shirt like in the picture it is just 2 bra cups and it doesn't look that good.,72720,4
72720,It looked exactly like the picture though,72720,4
72721,"So cute and soft, except they  bottoms my grandson wears a 2 got him a 3 and the bottoms are a little rough feeling...",72721,4
72723,It arrived on time and in good condition.,72723,4
72723,"The print is rubberized (might peel off easily during wash and dryer)
Fit: i ordered size 4 for my 2 and a half.",72723,4
72723,"It is just right with a bit of allowance
Looks pretty comfy.",72723,4
72723,Came with a free sticker.,72723,4
72724,Nice prices for sturdy reading glasses.,72724,4
72725,A littexpress too big,72725,4
72726,"It's underwear, it fits, what else is there to discuss",72726,4
72727,Only reason I gave it a 4 Instead of 5 is there was a little hole on one sleeve.,72727,4
72727,Not enough to return it but enough to knock down a star.,72727,4
72728,I bought these shorts because as a tall woman I need shorts with a longer inseam.,72728,4
72728,They are nice shorts but they are a little tight in the rear.,72728,4

72733,"Cute, and well constructed.",72733,4
72733,"Just a touch small for a folder, but you can fit them with just a little bending at the top 2 corners.",72733,4
72733,If this were a completely full sized backpack it would be perfect!,72733,4
72734,Gives as a gift.,72734,4
72735,"As the other reviewers have stated, this runs small.",72735,4
72735,The shoulders were too narrow and the belt tied just below the bust and the fit caused it to hang oddly for me.,72735,4
72735,"That being said, the coat is beautifully constructed from a very nice material.",72735,4
72735,"I wanted to be able to wear this, but I think even if I had gone up a size, it would have still not hung properly.",72735,4

72740,But I had already sent one order back  because it was too small,72740,4
72741,"Pretty, a little thin",72741,4
72742,"fits good, but cheap material",72742,4

72745,My only complaint is that the straps are a little thin width- wise and don't hide all of my bunion.,72745,4
72745,"Still keeping them, but will look for wider Velcro straps in white.",72745,4
72745,The ones I bought are black.,72745,4
72746,Durable and did keep mittens secured to my 8 year old's coat very well.,72746,4

72749,We had a lot of fun wearing this for our newborn pictures!,72749,4

Overall nice swimsuit for the price",72750,4
72751,Super light and pretty easy to get on for a 3-year-old.,72751,4
72751,"Not as ""tough"" as other heftier brands, so wore out more quickly.",72751,4
72752,Very beautiful and classy but wish it was a little lighter.,72752,4
72754,Bought it for my daughter.,72754,4
72754,"It actually came in earlier than expected,",72754,4

72758,I was worried about not buttoning but this really does keep your pants very secure.,72758,4
72758,"Though under 7 months, it looked awful like giving me love handles where they didn't actually exist.",72758,4
72759,A bit  more off white than the brown i was expecting.,72759,4
72760,Pretty & fun...a nice change from fine jewelry.,72760,4
72761,"Fits okay, seems warm.",72761,4
72762,I love this skirt,72762,4
72763,I bought it for swim class it stretched out a little after a few months.,72763,4

72768,"It's nice but wow, you definitely need a slip and a nice bra!",72768,4
72768,I ordered an XL and it's a bit shorter that I would have wanted but I know it'll look good when we hit Vegas up in February.,72768,4
72769,"Nice material, but a bit wide so it would look best on someone with a large chest or a jacket to cover the lower part.",72769,4
72770,Thinner material than I thought but it's a very gorgeous dress.,72770,4
72770,My daughter said it's too blood red for her but I like the color.,72770,4
72771,"I did like this hat, however, the brim was so wide that my daughter was having trouble seeing from side to side!",72771,4
72772,Nice for the price,72772,4
72773,It fit really good,72773,4
72775,Love the swim suit,72775,4
72776,"Quality and everything is good, but it does run a little big.",72776,4
72776,The only complaint that I have is that it is NOT black.,72776,4
72776,It''s a very dark green.,72776,4
72776,I don't know if it is supposed to be like this.,72776,4
72777,The MAGA has a power.,72777,4
72777,The power to trigger.,72777,4

72777,Simply represent your passion for America and let them make fools of themselves.,72777,4
72777,"This hat is amazing, but if you can afford it I recommend buying official gear from the man's official site.",72777,4
72778,"Very cute and comfy, but order a size up!",72778,4
72779,Really like this case fits very nicely into my hands and a lot people say they have this weird white blurred line on the bottom of there pictures but I took of couple of pictures and had no problem with it came in a little dirty but with a little bit of soap does the trick but you get what you get so I recommend this case 100% and came in very early so I was happy about that,72779,4
72780,It is really cute on and the asymmetrical part is perfectly flowy like seen in the picture.,72780,4
72780,I did think the shoulders and arms of the jacket were kind of tight but they loosen a bit after you wear it.,72780,4
72780,Overall I think this was a good purchase.,72780,4
72781,Not very flexible though.,72781,4
72782,Great price and comfortable,72782,4
72783,"The only negative is one of the jewels came unglued, easy fix just could be better quality.",72783,4
72784,I'm 5'9' and 245lbs.,72784,4
72784,I think I still had room in the length!,72784,4
72784,Fits higher in the back than I thought.,72784,4
72784,I think it will be perfect for my water aerobics class.,72784,4
72784,Hard to get on/off over shoulders/arms.,72784,4
72784,"It is offered in a zip front, so I will purchase it next time.",72784,4
72785,One size to small,72785,4
72786,I love this sweater but when I opened it there was a smell to it that would not even come out in the wash.,72786,4
72787,"Love it, However the medium size was super big.",72787,4
72787,I  usually wear.,72787,4
72787,a medium but in this case .,72787,4
72787,A size small would have worked better.,72787,4
72788,Size does run small!!!,72788,4
72788,I am usually a medium.,72788,4
72788,I read other reviews and decided to get a x-large.,72788,4
72788,The hoodie is good BUT my hoodie does not include the string for the hood.,72788,4
72789,Used these for a trip to Iceland.,72789,4
72789,"They made packing a breeze, everything was so much more organized.",72789,4
72789,"The mesh on one bag started to tear away from the seam, may have been over stuffing on my part but I hope it stays small so I can continue to reuse it for a long time.",72789,4
72790,I adore this product except that it fits one size too small.,72790,4
72790,Buy one size up from your current coat or sweater size.,72790,4
72792,"It's a good shirt, but it needs some ironing to get the wrinkles out.",72792,4
72793,"Nice material, cute pattern but runs too small.",72793,4
72793,"I'm 5'2"" and 110 lbs and the sleeves and legs are short on me.",72793,4
72794,Great piece of kit!,72794,4
72795,There's Chinese or Japanese writing on the bottom of the shoe along with grippers.,72795,4
72796,This is costume jewelry at its best.,72796,4
72796,It arrived earlier than expected.,72796,4
72796,The colors are as bold and vivid as they appear to be.,72796,4
72797,Seems to run a half to a full size too bit.,72797,4
72797,Other than they work just fine.,72797,4
72798,It's really pretty but unfortunately I went by the sizing and it was still too small.,72798,4
72798,I'm usually a 10/12 and ordered a 16.,72798,4
72798,"However, I couldn't get it to fit around my chest area.",72798,4
72798,I'm super bummed as it's gorgeous.,72798,4
72800,This does not come with bottoms so you would have to wear underpants.,72800,4
72800,I wish it had a bra in it but if you have perky boobs it would be great.,72800,4
72800,It is very cute and long enough to cover large thighs.,72800,4
72801,We spent over $300 for a dress last year bought in a boutique.,72801,4
72801,Will never do that again.,72801,4
72802,"For the price, these are very nice Mockneck shirts.",72802,4

72804,Overall a good buy for the price,72804,4
72805,A lot thinner material then expected but I the person I got it for as a gift loved it.,72805,4
72806,My daughter seems to like it.,72806,4
72807,I am a nurse with a few jobs and I love this bag because it allows me to organize my tools as well as plop my purse inside and run out the door for work.,72807,4
72807,I love that the top zippers so things don't fall out.,72807,4
72807,The pockets are big enough to hold water bottles which is another plus!,72807,4
72807,Not to mention its eye catching and adorable!,72807,4
72808,"Nice scarf very stylish and quality seems excellent I'm a little disappointed with the length, the one I received is 72"".",72808,4
72808,A few more inches would be nice.,72808,4
72809,This is a nice quality bag.,72809,4
72809,I would highly recommend this purchase.,72809,4
72810,By the time this came (in navy) the black was available so I returned it and look forward to receiving the replacement piece.,72810,4
72810,Gonna be great for travel and shopping!,72810,4
72812,"I like it but should go 1size up  o maybe 2but may be i gain weight too, the material its good quality and ita little stressed",72812,4
72813,It is so soft.,72813,4
72813,I love the feel of it and it looks nice also.,72813,4
72813,You really can't beat the price.,72813,4
72813,I would definitely recommend.,72813,4
72814,Didn't fit how I like.,72814,4
72814,It's a bit to stretchy Is what I'd say.,72814,4
72814,"Even with hair pins it slide off :( I give 4 stars because it's really comfy to wear to bed , it doesn't have to stay in place while I sleep so its perfect to keep all my hair up ( I have knee length hair )",72814,4
72815,a little large but it really works,72815,4
72816,I loved them but they ran small.,72816,4
72817,"I love this purse,on the small size but perfect for date night or weekend purse.",72817,4
72818,"Cute dress, the material is a little shiny.",72818,4
72818,Looks cute with ankle booties.,72818,4
72819,"I ordered a small (I'm a 4), but it fits more like a medium (8).",72819,4
72819,"Because of the cut, it can be a little big.",72819,4
72819,"Cute shirt, but an x-small would have been better.",72819,4
72820,XXL is wide but short in the sleeves and waist.,72820,4
72820,"I am 6'3"" and need the length, not the width.",72820,4
72821,it fits good but my only flaw is while wearing it it wants to unhook so gotta keep pushing the USB piece into it's little hole on the bracelet.,72821,4
72821,it plugs into the pc & windows finds the driver.,72821,4
72821,it saves the information & loads it up just like a thumb drive/jump drive,72821,4
72822,I thought I ordered the package with the three different colors but it seems I didn't.,72822,4
72822,I got the package today and it had all three but they where all silver.,72822,4
72822,Just wish I had got the right ones,72822,4
72823,fits well hope it doesn't shrink or fade.,72823,4
72823,Haven't worn it yet.,72823,4
72824,They came packaged in pairs or individually in a drawstring pouch.,72824,4
72824,Very good buy for the price.,72824,4
72824,Would recommend that you not wear them to bed or in the shower.,72824,4
72825,like it but the sizes run quite small so I gave it to my bestie.,72825,4
72825,hope she likes it,72825,4
72826,Good for the price but not the best.,72826,4
72827,"I'm caught between giving 3 or 4 stars because it's not as sparkly/ shiny as it was depicted and it didn't come in a velvet box, but instead it came in a small suede pouch.",72827,4
72827,Each pair was in small plastic bags in the small pouch.,72827,4
72827,"I've only had them for a few days, so I can't speak durability but these seem to be reasonably priced.",72827,4
72827,"Though I must say that I've purchased much better cubics at the beauty supply, but at mine a pair costs up to $20.",72827,4
72830,"It's a good shirt; very stylish and pretty, but don't expect that animal print part to cover up your belly!",72830,4
72830,"I did, and it actually does the opposite and makes your belly stand out.",72830,4
72830,"OK if you're pregnant, but not very flattering if you're NOT pregnant and trying to hide your pregnant-looking unpregnant belly.",72830,4
72830,I have to use a stretchy corset to make this shirt look good on me.,72830,4
72830,I'm also saving it for a maternity shirt since the animal-print belly section is very very stretchy.,72830,4
72830,Overall I recommend this shirt.,72830,4
72831,Very pretty but it fit too tight on the back  I didn't expect it from a size 6 I'd like to try it in size 8 please,72831,4
72832,"Hat fits perfect, looks like picture online",72832,4
72833,"Hmm, a bit small for me.",72833,4
72833,(But I do have a big bust sooo...) It flattens my chest a lot more then the other one I bought on here.,72833,4
72833,It'd be good to wear just for school.,72833,4
72833,"Its sturdy, made out of great material.",72833,4
72833,"Although it's a bit snug, it's still breathable and it's still comfortable.",72833,4
72835,"Fit as expected, bought along with a navy colour which fit horribly so happy with this one.",72835,4
72836,A little tight in the waist and pretty long.,72836,4
72837,"A little small on my right hand, which is a little big because I do construction.",72837,4
72838,Great quality and styling,72838,4
72839,"The material is really nice, I tried it on and hopefully I shall be wearing it soon....I am please I must say",72839,4
72840,"I really like this dress, and I suspect I'll be ordering one in black too.",72840,4
72840,"My only complaint is the sheer quality to the fabric, it is very thin.",72840,4
72840,"I'm 5'8, 130 and the fabric stops at my ankles.",72840,4
72841,"So, it's adorable in person!",72841,4
72841,But also really really really cheaply made.,72841,4
72841,"I wish there had been a option for one that was $10 more, but was a decent quality.",72841,4
72841,I'm pretty sure it'll fall apart in the sooner rather than later.,72841,4
72841,But the collar is oh so cute!,72841,4
72841,EXCEPT that the collar circumference is gigantic.,72841,4
72841,I had an extra maybe 6 inches around my neck!,72841,4
72841,so you have to pretty much wear it open.,72841,4
72841,Also the shirt is a giant box.,72841,4
72841,"Not that long in the body, so best worn under something (sweater/vest/sweater-vest) and the sleeves are, of course, too short.",72841,4
72841,"So you have to really work it to make it work, but if you do, it looks really cute.",72841,4
72841,"Fabric for the shirt is also a really cheap poly, so that just is what it is, I guess.",72841,4
72841,"I'm planning to take it in on the sides so it is not so huge & boxy, but haven't gotten to it yet.",72841,4
72843,Fits exactly like I though and is fun and breezy,72843,4
72844,I ordered it larger so I was expecting to have to take it in at the top.,72844,4
72844,It's going to be perfect for the masquerade ball once I have it altered!,72844,4
72844,"Even if you don't have to have it altered, you may wish to have the crinoline fluffed out a little by a dry cleaner due to the flattening of the dress during shipping.",72844,4
72844,I CANNOT wait to wear it!!,72844,4
72845,"Nice fit, but no real arch support, wearable for all day tho.",72845,4
72846,It actually does have padding and is lined so that's nice :),72846,4
72847,Ordered a 2x was still pretty small on me,72847,4
72848,Exactly what I expected - love em - only little thing is the rubber backings go missing when I'm wearing - not really a big deal but feedback all the same...,72848,4
72849,"This set is beautiful, but it ran large and was too long for my 5'4"" height.",72849,4
72849,I gave it to someone else.,72849,4
72850,I purchased one size larger knowing when they were laundered they would fit just right and they do.,72850,4
72851,"I  really  like it I expected a cheap looking suite based but it looks great I just wish I could have bought the pieces separately as I really need a small bottom n medium
I'm 5 6 about 120 pounds 34c and the top is pretty tight",72851,4
72852,Used this as an extra bag for travel.,72852,4
72852,It worked well and holds a LOT of stuff.,72852,4
72852,I tested it prior to the trip to see what I could fit in there as well as how it would handle weight and it did well on both counts.,72852,4
72852,We did choose to use a better (more comfortable/padded) shoulder strap from another bag but the one that comes with it would work too.,72852,4
72852,The bag is light and easy to refold.,72852,4
72852,"In addition to the zippered pocked that the bag folds back into, there are two pouches on either side that are great for boarding passes, small books, water, or whatever.",72852,4
72852,We used the bag for souvenirs.,72852,4
72854,"Material felt very cheap and it could rip easily, but it hasn't so far.",72854,4
72854,I'm 5'3 @ 140 lbs and I ordered a one-size.,72854,4
72854,"Though cheap feeling, it is adjustable and can stretchy, so its a pretty comfortable fit.",72854,4
72856,"Really cute, just took awhile to receive.",72856,4
72857,I bought this for my 12 year old son who is very tall for his age.,72857,4
72857,"It fit nicely even if a little long for a 12 year old, but we expected that.",72857,4
72857,The quality was good and the fleece is thick and comfortable.,72857,4
72858,don't expect expensive materials but still adorable.,72858,4
72858,My daughter wore them as a flower girl.,72858,4
72859,This robe is very soft and comfortable.,72859,4
72859,I feel as though I could have purchased a smaller size but it works fine.,72859,4
72859,It keeps me warm when it gets cold in my room.,72859,4
72860,Favorte wallet of all time.,72860,4
72860,Got so many of my fam and friends to buy this.,72860,4
72860,They owe me commission.,72860,4
72861,The dress was visually satisfying.,72861,4
72861,It looked just like the picture.,72861,4
72861,"Now, I'm a 5'2 curly girl so my bust and hips fit the med measurements.",72861,4
72861,But it was way too long.,72861,4
72861,So expect to get it tailored!,72861,4
72861,Also the zipper isn't the best quality or maybe I got a faulty zipper but I have issues getting it zipped up.,72861,4
72861,Takes quite a few exhausting times to get it up.,72861,4
72861,"Overall, I love the dress and will be happy to wear it at my best friends wedding.",72861,4
72862,Awesome shirt made from great quality.,72862,4
72862,Tons of options and styles to select from.,72862,4
72863,"Arrived on time and works as advertised, good value",72863,4
72864,a hair cheap feeling.,72864,4
72864,overall worth the price.,72864,4
72865,Gave this to my sister,72865,4
72866,"Super comfy, however I have to re-adjust the tie frequently and pull them up.",72866,4
72866,"Not an issue with fit, just a design issue.",72866,4
72867,its somewhat large but over all i love the hat and have received many compliments,72867,4
72868,Cute and matches my sons uniform perfectly.,72868,4
72868,I had a design heat pressed on this shirt and it looks great!,72868,4
72869,Still fits and I still live it..,72869,4
72870,Very good for the price.,72870,4
72870,I like that it has an arch.,72870,4
72870,Seems to fit into all of my athletic shoes.,72870,4
72870,The fit seems to match exactly how it is stated by the company.,72870,4
72871,I'm giving it 4 stars because it didn't fit as well as other Ralph Lauren Polo dresses that look identical.,72871,4
72871,It runs small due to the thicker knit fabric of this one.,72871,4
72871,"While I normally wear a small, with room to spare, this dress fit too snug for my taste.",72871,4
72871,Well made and no issue with quality but had to return due to size.,72871,4
72871,If ordering this dress I would  recommend ordering up one size.,72871,4
72871,I give speed of shipping and customer service 5 stars.,72871,4
72872,Pretty good quality and looks exactly like the picture.,72872,4
72873,Got and extra large and they still felt like a medium.,72873,4
72873,"I'm a 5'7 150 lb and usually a size 12 fits perfect, these were not big enough.",72873,4
72873,"Cute, just too tight",72873,4
72874,"Purchased this dress for casual wear and it fit perfect, but the only thing I don't like is, it's not a maxi dress.",72874,4
72874,It came down to above my ankles.,72874,4
72874,"Other than that I like how the dress forms to my body, very light and cool.",72874,4
72875,It is what the description stated.,72875,4
72876,I'm happy with this shirt!,72876,4
72876,"Looks pretty much like the picture except not truely long sleve, more like 3/4th.",72876,4
72876,"i am usually a small is US shirts and i ordered a M. It fits good, just a little lose.",72876,4
72876,Over all i am happy!,72876,4
72877,10 yo son loves.,72877,4
72877,Meets his needs perfectly.,72877,4
72877,For the price it was a great buy.,72877,4
72878,The details on this shirt are really nice but it's shorter in person half of your belly is out,72878,4
72879,Very cute but much too large.,72879,4
72879,"We ordered a 2T, what arrived was labeled 120 and looked like a 4T.",72879,4
72879,Too cute to return so we will wait until our grandson grows into it.,72879,4
72879,Neck is not too tight.,72879,4
72880,It was a little hard to figure out till I looked at the picture again!,72880,4
72881,"very nice but runs large, was here in no time",72881,4
72882,Bought this for my tween.,72882,4
72882,She is normally a size small in women's clothes.,72882,4
72882,"This fit great, except that the chest padding is very bulky and does not look good unless you have at least a B cup size.",72882,4
72883,Will definitely take some getting used to and can't wear with low cut shirts but that's ok.,72883,4
72884,"Didn't get a chance to wear it yet, but it should do just fine.",72884,4
72885,"Me:  52, 116 lbs, Purchased size small (fits fine the way I like).",72885,4
72885,"I purchased all 4 pairs and will give individual reviews on each accordingly:

1.",72885,4
72885,"90 Degree By Reflex 22"" Yoga Capris Lightning Blue S
2.",72885,4
72885,"90 Degree by Reflex Power Flex Yoga Pants - Red  Small
3.",72885,4
72885,"90 Degree By Reflex - High Waist Tummy Control Shapewear - Power Flex Capri Legging - Quality Guaranteed - Reflex Blue Small
4.",72885,4
72885,"Power Flex Capri 22 Inch Watermelon S

22"" Yoga Capris Lightning Blue S:  I purchased the same pair from Marshalls and am the kind of person that if I like something I want it in all colors and even have double of things.",72885,4
72885,After not being able to find my size and the color I wanted at several of the Marshalls and TJMaxx I went to I found it on Amazon.,72885,4
72885,"The length is nice, it's below the calf which I like and about 4 inches above my ankle.",72885,4
72885,There is a fingers width space between the leg opening and my skin but I don't mind that loose look and beside I can hike it up higher if I want it to be snug.,72885,4
72885,"My complaint is, because I'm very particular and will examine every stitching and line, this capris is slightly a lighter color than the one I have and they're supposedly both lightning blue.",72885,4
72885,"Another thing is the stitching looks a little cheaper (see picture, the one in the back is from Marshalls and the one in the front I ordered from here).",72885,4
72885,"The stitching is off a little and there's a ""hump"" in the waist band that probably wouldn't bother other people but it bothers me.",72885,4
72885,It's not bad enough for me to return and not worth the hassle to return so I will be keeping the pants.,72885,4
72886,But I love it on my wife,72886,4
72887,"Great for our 1st grader - doesn't feel super thick or sturdy but when they're not carrying much, it's fine!",72887,4
72887,She LOVES the style!,72887,4
72888,Really brightens up and makes everything clear.,72888,4
72888,"Not great for direct sun, but I am not having to squint.",72888,4
72888,"Style is ok, but fit is a bit tight on sides.",72888,4
72889,"So i ordered the guys kind because I have big feet for a woman, and like other imported things, American sizes are still MUCH bigger than their imported equivalent.",72889,4
72889,"But these are true to size, which is great!",72889,4
72889,"I am not sure how long they are going to last, but i'm fine with getting through the summer with these and they go.",72889,4
72889,"They all stay on my feet perfectly except for one sock from one pair, and just a little adjusting from time to time works for when i wear them with my Vibram Five Fingers.",72889,4
72889,"These are exactly what i was hoping for, a  lightweight, comfortable, function alternative to expensive toe socks!",72889,4
72890,Buy 1 size up.,72890,4
72891,"I've been trying waist trainers, and though this came in packaging that looked like it was straight from the sweatshop, this one is actually pretty good!",72891,4
72891,"Five rows of hooks are awesome--I started on 3rd to last, now I'm at 2nd to last, so I suppose I could've ordered a size down.",72891,4
72891,Breathable material is really nice.,72891,4
72891,Can be worn under looser clothes.,72891,4
72891,"Maintains its shape fairly well, so far.",72891,4
72891,"To be honest, I was skeptical when this arrived.",72891,4
72891,"For some reason it just looked cheap and kind of shady, and I know it was very cheap.",72891,4
72891,"Since then I've tried a half-dozen other trainers, and this is my favorite.",72891,4
72892,There was only one problem with it.,72892,4
72892,The grey shirt is actually a very light grey and does not look like the picture at all.,72892,4
72892,I personally didn't mind much but I would have liked it to be a little darker.,72892,4
72893,Very nice for the price.,72893,4
72893,"Haven't worn it yet, but fits well and the color is true to the picure.",72893,4
72894,cheaper quality than I'd hoped and has a very stupid strap I had to cut off (supposed to look like a bra strap or tank strap on one side only so it can hand off that shoulder.,72894,4
72894,"It is very wide, wider than need be.",72894,4
72894,"That said, I'll wear it, it just won't be a favorite.",72894,4
72895,Neat design but WAYYY larger than expected.,72895,4
72896,"it is a little bulky but in terms of slots of cards, 2 ID windows, zippered secured wallet, it's perfect.",72896,4
72898,First time I washed it on gentle cycle the bottom ruffle separated from the seam by 3 inches because it was the seam I was able to stitch it in less than 10 minutes and it did not look as if it was stitched  otherwise love the dress the fit and the color,72898,4
72899,I made the mistake of basing my purchase off the first picture.,72899,4
72899,It does not appear to be a two piece.,72899,4
72899,I need something with a little more coverage.,72899,4
72899,Arrived sooner than expected.,72899,4
72899,It is a little larger than expected.,72899,4
72900,I actually use this to hold towels in place on chairs the dog uses.,72900,4
72900,It works really well.,72900,4
72901,I am SO glad I read the reviews before purchasing this!,72901,4
72901,"I am a slender girl (5'7'' and only 116 lbs) with a 34"" bust 27"" waist 35"" hip.",72901,4
72901,I ordered the large and the bottoms just *barely* fit my little booty.,72901,4
72901,"I took the crappy round inserts out of the top first thing (I will NEVER wear them) and tried it on and it was sorta loose (I'm a full D cup) but with the coverage I hope it won't present too much of a problem, especially since I purchased this bikini to give me some mobility without worrying about exposure.",72901,4
72901,"I have not worn it in the water yet, but the majority of all swimsuit fabrics will stretch a little when they're wet.",72901,4
72901,"That will probably mean the bottoms fitting more comfortably, but I may end up getting out my sewing machine and working some magic to get the top more snug.",72901,4
72901,"The fabric itself is soft but slightly on the thin side, and there is no lining on the inside of the butt, which is going to be a little scary considering how much white is in this print!",72901,4
72901,"The clasp on the back of the top is not adjustable, only the tie at the neck is.",72901,4
72901,The clasp itself is a silver metal that feels very lightweight.,72901,4
72901,"I hope it won't break or rust, but it doesn't bend when I apply a bit of pressure so that seems like a good sign so far.",72901,4
72901,"If there had been a higher quality version of this that I could find I would have preferred that because I love this design so much, but I'm afraid this is definitely on the lower-end side of quality.",72901,4
72901,"Still, I'm happy with the purchase, and I definitely intend to get my use out of it this summer.",72901,4
72902,I really do like this product because it can add some flair to a simple crew neck top.,72902,4
72902,:-)  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in purchasing it.,72902,4
72903,This pendent  came as shown.,72903,4
72904,This dress turned out beautiful for my daughter to attend a prom-like social event last night!!!!,72904,4
72904,"It fit well, zipper strong and length appropriate!",72904,4
72905,My niece liked them.,72905,4
72906,I love these Nursing gowns.,72906,4
72906,"They do feel like that run a little small, but they are super comfy and come in a variety of cute colors.",72906,4
72906,I have purchased 3 already and will probably get several more before my little guy arrives.,72906,4
72907,"Skirt is a bit long (I'm about 5'3"" 155 lbs.",72907,4
72907,"), so I will be hemming it.",72907,4
72907,I got a size medium but measured a size large.,72907,4
72907,One flaw is the boot covers do not stay up at all!,72907,4
72907,"I had to put rubber bands on each boot at the top by my knees, to hold the boot covers up.",72907,4
72907,Then the toe part keeps sliding off my shoes.,72907,4
72907,So I bought the actual wonder woman boots to wear instead.,72907,4
72907,"(not pictured) Other than the boot covers being horrible, the costume is very comfortable and cute!",72907,4
72907,I can't wait till Halloween to wear it!,72907,4
72907,"The picture is with everything that comes with the costume, the boot covers look cute but do not stay up, it wasn't too bad with the rubber bands at the top but then the foot part would slide off as I walked around.",72907,4
72907,This would be very annoying all night at a party.,72907,4
72908,Very cute but definitely get a size larger when purchasing.,72908,4
72909,"Love it, but run small (((",72909,4
72910,After my third time ordering I finally got the right one that fits me.,72910,4
72910,I really like how it makes my back feel as well as keeping my stomach nice and flat throughout the day.,72910,4
72911,I am very happy with the way this fits.,72911,4
72911,It flatters my figure without being revealing.,72911,4
72911,This is hard to do when you rock an Hcup.,72911,4
72913,"Loose and very roomy, I where a 16/2X so I ordered a 3X and it's very nice",72913,4
72915,"Plastic window rips out over time, but solid product for about 2 years.",72915,4
72916,I use the hat for golfing.,72916,4
72917,Loved this but it's not thick enough to be considered a sweater.,72917,4
72918,Did not fit at all got a full refund,72918,4
72919,"They are really cute, but run a bit small.",72919,4
72919,My small 7.5 year old can wear the size sm/md (though it's tough to get them on) and my 4 year old wears the sm/md fine.,72919,4
72919,Definitely for small kids.,72919,4
72920,My toddler boy loves these soft and warm socks!,72920,4
72920,"4 stars because they have no traction, and he has slipped on our hardwood floors too many times..",72920,4
72921,"I usually buy clothes that I feel are at minimum a 7, and try to use buy something I feel an 8 or higher about - thus ensuring I'll wear it more than once or twice, and that I'll own mostly ""I LOVE IT!",72921,4
72921,"""/""This makes me/my XYZ look fantastic!""",72921,4
72921,"items, vs. ""eh, it was cheap, and on sale..."" It's part of the philosophy I adopted when I graduated college, to own more of an adult wardrobe without owning 17 of the same shirts, just in different colors.",72921,4
72921,"Smart choices, that will lead to a long lasting, classic wardrobe, with minimal wasted money.",72921,4
72921,"I had to explain that, to explain that I was unsure about this dress.",72921,4
72921,I was waffling between a 6.5 and a 7.,72921,4
72921,"In the photo, the top (with the black buttons) seems to make up a third of the dress and be a much larger portion that the top of my size 12.",72921,4
72921,"As a result, I was left more conflicted (as I'd liked the photo), and it was my boyfriend who really convinced me that he really liked it (he doesn't like anything.",72921,4
72921,"Everything is ""it's ok""), so I kept it.",72921,4
72921,I bought this to be able to wear to work - it's a color I love and it's visually interesting.,72921,4
72921,"The darts do have the potential to sit a bit high on my 'lady lumps', but I moved around when trying this on, and it wasn't a big problem.",72921,4
72921,"I also didn't realize from the photos, it comes with a belt.",72921,4
72921,I may or may not use it.,72921,4
72921,"So I like the dress, but I'm not yet in love with it, and I will try and post photos of me in it once I get a chance to wear for comparison.",72921,4
72921,"For reference, I ordered an 12, as I am 5'4 but very busty with an hourglass shape.",72921,4
72921,"It's a nice fabric, a bit stretchy (so the bottom doesn't seem voluminous in comparison to the top), but not clingy so that I feel I need Spanx or something.",72921,4
72921,"I would recommend this to someone else, as I think it's a cute dress and worth giving a shot.",72921,4
72921,"I washed this in a delicates bag, by itself, on our delicates cycle (we don't have a hand wash or a wool cycle), using the Forever New washing powder (only thing I use on delicates/bras/handwash items), and lay it flat to dry on a drying rack.",72921,4
72921,"Great results, and I couldn't love this dress more.",72921,4
72922,Beautiful bag that I've gotten many compliments on.,72922,4
72922,"The leather part of the strap was not glued properly on the ends upon receipt, but a little e6000 took care of the problem.",72922,4
72922,Otherwise the workmanship was better than expected.,72922,4
72923,perfect for slim people,72923,4
72924,"Colors true to picture, design super cute, shirts are soft.",72924,4
72925,Nice earrings only problem I had is that the stem was a little bit bent.,72925,4
72925,Thought the star was green however was blue.,72925,4
72927,Very thin but very beautiful.,72927,4
72928,"I loved it and came much earlier than expected, highly recommended, thank you!",72928,4
72929,Since the color is listed as rose red i thought the color in the picture wasn't true to life.,72929,4
72930,I bought this for my 4 year old so I expected it to be a little big.,72930,4
72930,Nice print and great for any MH fan.,72930,4
72930,Item as shown in pic.,72930,4
72931,"It's a lot larger than I suspected it to be, as I am a size 18 and the measurements claimed that it would fit UP TO an 18.",72931,4
72931,"I expected it to be tight, but when I tried it on, I was absolutely swimming in it.",72931,4
72931,"Ah well, I still adore it regardless.",72931,4
72932,Great attire accessory for his camping lumberjack party,72932,4
72933,These are really cute on my kiddos but my 2 year old toddlers barely fit into them.,72933,4
72933,"Additionally, they are not very flexible which is a must for toddlers.",72933,4
72933,I'm saving them until they can grow into them a bit more and not destroy them.,72933,4
72934,They came out pretty well.,72934,4
72934,I'm glad that I didn't size up.,72934,4
72934,Get your exact size to ensure it fits properly.,72934,4
72935,No bag given so you'll have to get one yourself if it's a gift.,72935,4
72936,"The string I received did not have the guru tassle bead as pictured, just a continuous string.",72936,4
72936,"One of the beads has a very faint etching on it, so maybe that was supposed to be the guru bead, but you have to really look for it.",72936,4
72936,"Would not be able to tell if you were sitting with eyes closed, moving along the string, but otherwise it is a nice looking mala I can wear around my wrist for when I need a grounding aid and a short sit.",72936,4
72936,"For the price, very nice.",72936,4
72937,"GOOD PRODUCT, BUT A LITTLE SMALL, RETURNED(NO HASSLE) AND GOT THE 2X LONG(I THINK LT).",72937,4
72937,IM 6.4 240 LBS,72937,4
72938,Metal is cheap and tends to smell metallic after a few uses.,72938,4
72938,Get what you pay for!,72938,4
72938,But overall no problems and I would recommend.,72938,4
72940,Like: easy to wear summer pregnant dress!,72940,4
72940,The floral print is super cute too.,72940,4
72940,Dislike: bust was a little too small revealing a bit of cleavage.,72940,4
72940,The fabric is a little low quality.,72940,4
72940,I still wore it bc I didn't have many other options!,72940,4
72941,Runs a size smaller but love the light weight material.,72941,4
72942,It Is A Harry Potter Fan's Dream Come True!!,72942,4
72942,"However, It Functions No Differently Than Any Other Back Pack.",72942,4
72943,"Heading is very full, and intricate.",72943,4
72943,But the top is just too big and the back clasps to pieces of the thread that just come undone so I'm going to buy actual loop things for the hooks.,72943,4
72943,Very soft inside absolutely beautiful.,72943,4
72943,I should have been smart and sent in measurements but I didn't so please.,72943,4
72944,These are a steal for the price.,72944,4
72944,I have a lot of socks and I was intrigued by this design.,72944,4
72944,So far they meet my expectations and have garnered a few complements.,72944,4
72945,I'm small so I don't mind the fit being a little bigger.,72945,4
72945,X-small would have been great but the color is better than the picture.,72945,4
72945,The flowers are almost a blue gray and found blue-gray with black panties at another store.,72945,4
72945,So overall I say 4 stars for almost perfect but nothing is perfect!,72945,4
72946,"Shipped fast, they look nice and are comfortable!",72946,4
72948,Fit is really small.,72948,4
72948,"my daughter is 5'4"" and 110 to 112 lbs and  the size small was so tight she couldn't get it buttoned.",72948,4
72948,"My daughter is an Asian teenager, so if you have any type of figure at all you might want to size way up or try another style altogether.",72948,4
72948,The medium fit perfect and is a nice blouse.,72948,4
72949,I wore this as part of my catwoman outfit for halloween.,72949,4
72949,"just wish it was a bit longer, but i was looking for a body suit when i ordered this.",72949,4
72951,"It's great, good quality material!",72951,4
72952,Nice quality my daughter loves them,72952,4
72953,Very helpful for walking.,72953,4
72954,Fabric feels cheap but shipped fast!,72954,4
72955,I could have ordered a smaller size to get the fit closer to the photo.,72955,4
72955,"Also, mine was a lighter gray color than the one shown here.",72955,4
72956,Love the face of the wallet.,72956,4
72956,"Only problem is that there is no magnetic stripe to hold it together, so it flops open alllll the time.",72956,4
72956,Also the print got scuffed on the  corners day one.,72956,4
72958,Tried them out on a short run.,72958,4
72958,"They fit well, no bunching, no chafing.",72958,4
72958,"If I like them for winter running, I'll definitely buy more.",72958,4
72959,Some boots are really hard to put on.,72959,4
72959,These zip all the way down and on the front so getting into them is easier,72959,4
72960,Was what I expected for a Halloween costume.,72960,4
72960,"As posted, it runs small.",72960,4
72960,"A bit pricey for what you get, but most costumes are.",72960,4
72961,"I asked for XL but got XXL I tried it on a little big but still to my liking, still satisfied!!",72961,4
72962,It was a gag gift for.my girl but she really likes it.,72962,4
72962,This is NOT high quality but it has lasted for a few months being worn periodically.,72962,4
72964,The color is actually darker,72964,4
72965,I love them but i am really skinny and they are very tight even for me.,72965,4
72965,They look exactly like the picture and the shipment was in time.,72965,4
72967,The belt is very well made and looks better than the picture.,72967,4
72968,The bottoms fit great!,72968,4
72968,The top was way to big but the seller sent me a smaller top at no charge.,72968,4
72968,I absolutely love this bathing suit.,72968,4
72968,The color and style is great!,72968,4
72969,The veil is like the picture and very beautiful,72969,4
72970,This shirt is labeled inside as a 3/4 but sold as a 4.,72970,4
72970,"It fits, but just.",72970,4
72970,He won't be able to wear it as long as his 4's,72970,4
72971,"I expected the peter pan collar, but it's the pointy one.",72971,4
72971,"However I will keep it, since it works out great, I'll just buy another one.",72971,4
72972,"For the price, no complaints on the quality, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.",72972,4
72972,"However, it didn't fit.",72972,4
72972,"I am 5.7"" to 5.8"" about 185 lbs.",72972,4
72972,"I wear a 14 or 16 pants and large to xl shirts, my bra size is 38 c or d. The suit fit OK width wise everywhere but the chest, it was a little tight on the girls than I would have liked, although that too could be due to how short it was.",72972,4
72972,The big problem was the length.,72972,4
72972,"I know this is an Asian remake, but I'd hoped they adjusted the length to better fit American women, but it doesn't seem that way.",72972,4
72972,"The suit is 12"" from the top to the hip.",72972,4
72972,I needed another inch or two in length to fit my frame.,72972,4
72972,"It is an adorable suit though, I certainly wish I could keep it!",72972,4
72972,"Oh, & the little buttona are adorable, but they are single stitched on.",72972,4
72972,So I'd suggest reinforcing them before you go swimming.,72972,4
72973,"It fit very well, but it won't stand down",72973,4
72975,We ordered a size 1.5 for my just-turned-8 year old who is normally a 1 and the shoes barely fit.,72975,4
72975,They were out of stock of size 2 at the time and I thought 2.5 would be way too big.,72975,4
72975,These shoes run very small and narrow (my son has normal width feet).,72975,4
72975,"Other than that, the design is amazing and they are very high quality.",72975,4
72975,I will probably order another pair in 2.5,72975,4
72976,Fits me great and I was surprised of the high quality for the low price .,72976,4
72977,"Pretty comfortable,  however after wearing for about 5 hours I could feel they had stretched out a bit.",72977,4
72978,I'm a small so I got a small and It was a little large for me.,72978,4
72978,"It's not very form-fitting, either but I like it.",72978,4
72980,These aren't awesome cool guy sunglasses.,72980,4
72980,"That said, they are sweet in filtering out some high energy light that is a little harsh for me.",72980,4
72980,They do increase my perception and clarity/contrast in low to mid light situations and are great for me for driving.,72980,4
72980,"If you, like me, would like to limit your exposure to these lights, then these glasses will do the trick.",72980,4
72980,"Ultimately, my rating is based on functionality for me along with price.",72980,4
72981,I chose fit as expected because I have another pair all ready so knew they run small.,72981,4
72982,I first bought a xl and it was too small.,72982,4
72982,I returned it and got a 3x and it was still small in the top not much bigger then the xl but I like this dress.,72982,4
72983,Good product at a fair price.,72983,4
72984,"Loved it, a little bigger than I expected but it's usually hard to determine the size that works for you when ordering online.",72984,4
72984,But it was great material and very comfortable.,72984,4
72984,Definitely will purchase more.,72984,4
72985,I will have to have it altered.,72985,4
72985,I would of gotten a 6 normally but I got an 8 and I am glad I did.,72985,4
72985,I received it within 7 business days.,72985,4
72985,Very quick in my opinion.,72985,4
72986,I needed to find a hat for a tea party my friend had recently and saw this one online.,72986,4
72986,"Because of my hair, I did not expect the hat to fit exactly like it does on the model so I was happy it has hair clips to secure it on my head which was the reason I did not get a big derby hat.",72986,4
72986,I loved it and got a lot of compliments.,72986,4
72986,The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I was unaware of the little feathers on it.,72986,4
72986,The came coming off and got tangled all up in my hair lol,72986,4
72987,Seems that a 2X should be very large.,72987,4
72988,These are very nice leggings.,72988,4
72988,I love the colors and the fabric is very comfortable.,72988,4
72988,I gave this product four stars because after a couple of hours they start to slide down so they are not snug in the crouch anymore.,72988,4
72989,"They were flawed, but wearable.",72989,4
72989,"Mine are too small though, I'll have to reorder a larger size because I love the glow, and hopefully I can get a milkier pair.",72989,4
72990,"I love these compression leggings, especially for the price!",72990,4
72990,"I'm not usually one to wear leggings because I have a lot of 'junk in the trunk' but these don't look bad on me, and they're very comfortable to run in.",72990,4
72990,The high waist also gives additional lower back support which is nice.,72990,4
72990,My only complaints are they get a little see-through in the back after several washings and the zipper for the back pouch is flimsy and doesn't like to zip sometimes.,72990,4
72990,"I usually just zip it slowly and guide the zipper with my fingers, and I don't put too much in the pouch and it works fine.",72990,4
72990,"Also, I bought 2 pairs of the black leggings so they're just mildly see-through in the back, which isn't noticeable as long as you don't wear underwear with a print on them.",72990,4
72990,"Order a size smaller than usual, I'm 5'6' and 175 lbs right now and the medium fits me perfect.",72990,4
72991,Better for longer thinner torsos,72991,4
72992,i purchased this panty after a month c section surgery and i bought a l-xl and it was not tight but it fit good.,72992,4
72992,i want to order a size smaller than my size.,72992,4
72992,i recommend you purchased it its good product.,72992,4
72993,Great gift for my tween-aged Harry Potter fan!,72993,4
72994,"I bought an XL for my 15 year old son who is barely over 6 foot and under 180 pounds it was extremely tight and he could not zip up the hood, but he loved it and the glow in the dark works really well.",72994,4
72995,Good product for the money.,72995,4
72995,Sleeves are a bit short.,72995,4
72996,Good hat for beach,72996,4
72998,Amazing little swimsuit and it comes with a mermaid tail my soon to be 3yr old loves it.,72998,4
72998,Fits great the tail is a bit long for her but I just roll it up.,72998,4
72999,"I like the wallet, and the quality is nice.",72999,4
72999,I was a little disappointed at the amount of cards/cash I was able to get in.,72999,4
72999,"From the pictures I thought I would be able to easily fit all my cards, cash and IDs.",72999,4
72999,"In practice if you have more than a few bills folded in the center, it bulges the ID slot.",72999,4
72999,"In the photos posted, I have 13 individual bills, folded in half, and it produces the bulge.",72999,4
72999,"This isn't a killer, since this is far more bills than I typically carry, just happened to have extra when the wallet came in.",72999,4
72999,"Overall, this is a great wallet, just don't plan on carrying a lot in the center.",72999,4
72999,"I will post an update, should it start to wear out prematurely.",72999,4
73000,My 2 year old daughter enjoys wearing these pieces.,73000,4
73000,She even put the necklace on her waist without damaging it.,73000,4
73000,"These are sturdy, rounded pieces on elastic cord.",73000,4
73000,"The hair piece, however, just made a big mess due to the feathers.",73000,4
73001,Love the colors !,73001,4
73001,Love the material .,73001,4
73001,"Fits on the larger size , probably could of used a medium .",73001,4
73001,Will be one of my favorite shirts ever I believe !,73001,4
73002,Exactly as described- love it!,73002,4
73002,I get tons of compliments on it.,73002,4
73003,Everybody loves the design.,73003,4
73003,Had to have a hook sewed on the back so it wouldn't bulk up when  lying on my back.,73003,4
73004,"If you want ""smelly good"" leather, this may be for you.",73004,4
73004,"Its a little bulky, though.",73004,4
73004,"But, an excellent choice for those who are keeping good money with 'em.",73004,4
73005,Good shoes for the price.,73005,4
73006,This is a great satchel.,73006,4
73006,My Husband loves it!,73006,4
73008,"It's a nice dress, looks beautiful.",73008,4
73008,The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the dress is really short and looks like I'll have to wear it like a sweater over some sort of leggings I don't know.,73008,4
73010,This is a good quality made coat.,73010,4
73010,It is actually thicker than I expected but the fabric is soft for the a winter jacket that gives the coat not so gorgeous look as on the picture.,73010,4
73010,"Also, be aware that the main color is not true to the picture.",73010,4
73010,"In the reality, it is beige and darker than displayed.",73010,4
73010,The size for this one is true to US.,73010,4
73010,"I am 161 cm tall, 62 kg, 95-80-100 and usually wear size 8-10 or M .",73010,4
73010,I've bought M and it fits excellent even with the room for a very warm sweater.,73010,4
73010,I do not know how warm it is as I do not wear it yet.,73010,4
73010,"Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend the coat because it looks unique and unusual.",73010,4
73011,I think I just need it a size down,73011,4
73012,Will shrink in the dryer,73012,4
73013,"These look nice, ill come back and change my review if they fall apart or something",73013,4
73014,"Nice shirt, it has a good flow.",73014,4
73014,It is a little bit see through because of the thin material.,73014,4
73015,"I got an extra large cuz I wasn't sure if it was in asian sizes or not, it's definitely not asian size.",73015,4
73015,"I can alter it to fit, so it's not the end of the world.",73015,4
73016,pretty good but the cross guard doesn't retract which kind of sucks,73016,4
73018,"Adorable but is too large, waiting for my baby to grow into it so she can wear it.",73018,4
73019,Nice material & fit.,73019,4
73019,But XXL is too small for my 36D chest.,73019,4
73019,"They might fit a B cup, but definitely not a C or larger.",73019,4
73019,The straps are also a little thin if you have a heavy chest.,73019,4
73021,If you have anything over a C cup and don't want to sew please avoid this dress.,73021,4
73021,"I really like it and the fabric is very nice, but I had to sew the bust shut because the little bands that serve as eyelets for the buttons are flimsy and cheap.",73021,4
73021,After that I received many compliments on it and it is very comfortable.,73021,4
73022,Dramatic difference in the way my dress looked once I put it on.,73022,4
73022,I was on the fence about wearing one but this made the stress.,73022,4
73022,It is itchy so we decided to turn it inside out so the silk would be on the inside and the net more on the outside.,73022,4
73022,It solved the problem.,73022,4
73023,Very happy with these pajamas.,73023,4
73023,Would recommend to others.,73023,4
73024,Mmmm  it's not purple is white,73024,4
73025,"A Little small, order a size up.",73025,4
73025,The fabric is incredibly soft.,73025,4
73026,"Very pretty, my only complaint is that it isn't as long as I thought.",73026,4
73026,"The length is awkward..the fringe starts at my hips, when it SHOULD start at high/mid thigh.",73026,4
73028,This little outfit looked so cute.,73028,4
73028,It did run a bit small though so I'm glad the other reviewers had recommended ordering a size up.,73028,4
73028,The tie runs too so wash it separately.,73028,4
73029,Quick shipment and exactly as described,73029,4
73030,"Runs small, but my son loves it!!",73030,4
73032,"Love the fit, like the material a lot.",73032,4
73032,Happy with how comfortable it is,73032,4
73033,I like the pants,73033,4
73036,love this messangerr bag BUT the buckles come off way to easy as they are being held on by a small piece of metal.,73036,4
73036,so ill have to sew it on,73036,4
73037,"Nice and Good ,",73037,4
73038,"The only problem is that I am short and so they ride nearly up to my boobs, which is actually nice and warm for cold days.",73038,4
73038,Other than that these are very comfortable.,73038,4
73039,Great summer top..bought a size bigger and like that it fits a little baggy.,73039,4
73039,Arm holes are little too big but I just wear a tank top underneath to cover my bra.,73039,4
73039,It's cute with a maxi skirt or white jeans.,73039,4
73040,Love it...can't wait to wear it on my honeymoon!,73040,4
73041,Very cool looking and unusual.,73041,4
73041,It is very heavy and that get annoying sometimes as does it's incredibly loud ticking.,73041,4
73041,"For the price though, the kitch is worth it.",73041,4
73042,"I am 5'3"", and normally about 107 lbs, but currently 32 weeks pregnant and about 135 lbs.",73042,4
73042,"I got a small and it fits really well, and looks cute with my growing belly.",73042,4
73042,"My only complaint is that it rides up on the bottom when I walk, so I am constantly pulling it down as I walk.",73042,4
73043,I really love this necklace.,73043,4
73043,"Though, one of the red gems was missing when it arrived.",73043,4
73044,I am always satisfied with my orders,73044,4
73045,Purchased several as Christmas gifts for young travelers - hold what you need and slip into a pocket with RFID protection.,73045,4
73047,Very difficult to put on and needs to be removed by pulling it down.,73047,4
73047,"It is effective when worn and does hold in the ""fat"" under my arms and under the bra line.",73047,4
73048,Looks exactly how it does in the picture,73048,4
73051,Only problem was it was a big and I had to push the edges closer together to get it to stay on my nose.,73051,4
73051,Otherwise I would buy again.,73051,4
73053,"The bottom fits perfectly, but what even is the top??",73053,4
73053,"The straps that go around the next do not tie, they just wrap around the neck, and they are MUCH too long, leaving you with no coverage whatsoever.",73053,4
73053,"I'm sure this can be fixed by knotting the straps, or cutting them and re tying them.",73053,4
73053,It would have made more sense to make them adjustable.,73053,4
73054,Nice shirt...material is breathable,73054,4
73055,The wig came sooner than expected and is great for my Harley Quinn cosplay.,73055,4
73055,"However, there is no green as it looks like in the picture.",73055,4
73055,It's just red and black.,73055,4
73055,I'll be getting some extensions to fix that.,73055,4
73056,Beautiful color but the material itches my skin particularly the transparent part at the top of the dress that falls on the chest,73056,4
73057,I only gave this product a 4 star because I just received it so do not as of yet know how it will fair over time.,73057,4
73057,As of now I can say it arrived on time and looks beautiful.,73057,4
73057,After examining the jacket closely I can say it does have its imperfections but nothing worth complaining about because they really aren't noticeable unless you really are looking for something but hey normal wear and tare could cause a lot worse.,73057,4
73057,The sizing is somewhat small.,73057,4
73057,"After reading the reviews I went with a XXL because this is what I normally wear and it gives me some space but to parrot another persons description ""It Fits Like A Glove"" which if riding can be a very good thing just don't try wearing anything to heavy underneath.",73057,4
73057,I would also not recommend wearing it out on a bike on a real cold day because it is lightweight which is what I was looking for.,73057,4
73057,All in all I do Love this jacket so far...,73057,4
73058,Product is bug enough for my items thanks.,73058,4
73059,My dress came a whole month early with was awesome.,73059,4
73059,"The dress itself its great quality and looks just like the picture from the waist up, but I'm 5'7'' and normally wear smalls for these loose style winter dresses, but I went ahead and got the medium and it fits, but wish i got the large because of the length.",73059,4
73059,Its much shorter than the picture.,73059,4
73059,"The longer front and back hits me right mid-thigh while the short sides hits right below my butt, which is to short.",73059,4
73059,Great for wearing with leggings or tights though.,73059,4
73060,The Foot Fitter worked as expected.,73060,4
73060,I had purchased a pair of boots a couple of centimeters smaller by accident.,73060,4
73060,"The boot length was ok, however, the narrow part of the boot was a bit too narrow and very uncomfortable.",73060,4
73060,"I used the fitter for a couple of days and wore the boots to work, the awful discomfort was gone and I was able to walk in the boots without any real discomfort.",73060,4
73060,Just had to break them in a little after the stretching.,73060,4
73061,It broke but can be easily be fixed I am happy with this item,73061,4
73062,Comfortable for flip flops,73062,4
73063,Super Cute and lightweight,73063,4
73064,Makes ur shoulders a little broader and I would get one size bigger then normal but other then that it's pretty good!,73064,4
73065,Exactly what I needed for my costume,73065,4
73067,My son bought this for me and it is so cute.,73067,4
73067,I'm a small and it fits - although it is a bit smaller than a US small.,73067,4
73067,I grew up with cows so the gift was perfect for me...:-),73067,4
73068,The suite is so cute!!,73068,4
73068,The reason i gave it a 4 out of 5 is becasue i didn't realize the tail was open at the bottom.,73068,4
73070,Love my black harem pants so much .It is very comfortable and airy.,73070,4
73070,"And even though the fabric is thin which it is supposed to be, the print helps so does not feel like a see through.",73070,4
73070,I want this in another color.,73070,4
73070,great way to relax in this with a tee shirt and also great to run errands,73070,4
73071,This is exactly what I ordered and fits my 9 year old girl perfectly.,73071,4
73071,We are trying to make a Creepypasta costume but could not find the right this this fits the bill.,73071,4
73071,It goes to her knees and the rest fits exactly.,73071,4
73073,Got this fun number in a xxl because I have curves and boobs lol..,73073,4
73073,It fits like a glove.. Got so many compliments though,73073,4
73074,It's cute and flowy which i love but gave it 4 stars because it's tight in the chest area.,73074,4
73074,I'm a 34 B/C and my boobs are kinda squished in the dress.,73074,4
73074,"With some adjusting of my boobs, it looks good.",73074,4
73075,"I wear it all the time, it last for a really long time.",73075,4
73076,Giving four stars because zipper is not that smooth,73076,4
73077,pretty but to large,73077,4
73078,They are very comfortable and I love the colors.,73078,4
73078,They should be washed before wearing them b/c the colors bleed.,73078,4
73078,I now have pink tinged hand towels.,73078,4
73078,They use to be white.,73078,4
73078,:-) I don't mind that.,73078,4
73078,I like the new color of the towels.,73078,4
73079,My wife loves these..,73079,4
73079,I am not so crazy about them,73079,4
73080,"True size, I would not recommend to order down or up",73080,4
73081,I had to return the first pair I got because they run around 1/2 small,73081,4
73082,"I BOUGHT  IT FOR MY GIRLFRIEND ND SHE SAYS IT FITS OK, YEA",73082,4
73084,"This was a great outfit for the night however, the top is not fitted for large boobs.",73084,4
73084,I usually order a medium in two piece outfits but as I read the reviews I decided to get a small it fit but the top didn't cover my entire bra thank God I had a designer sports bra so it worked out with the sports bra showing.,73084,4
73085,Fabric is a lilltle thinner than I expected.,73085,4
73086,"Really fun fashion piece, especially considering the very very low price.",73086,4
73086,"I happen to like this ""rustic silver"", to me almost has an industrial chrome personality.",73086,4
73087,It a thick fabric comfortable especially doesnt roll down,73087,4
73088,"Good, but not great",73088,4
73089,the color was very nice wish it would've been larger...,73089,4
73090,They are a little loose around the lower butt,73090,4
73091,"Hat looks a little cheap, gets the job done however at a cheaper price.",73091,4
73092,"I'm usually a medium, but read others review and went one size up and bought a large.",73092,4
73092,"The fabric is nice and light, however if you have the butt, then good luck because the back is very short...",73092,4
73092,"I have to sqaut down to bend down and pick up stuff, because if I bend over my butt will show!",73092,4
73092,"Anyway, go a size or two up, especially if you're bigger from the waist down.",73092,4
73093,Vendor had to reship original order.,73093,4
73093,Worked out but did take some time.,73093,4
73094,"Fits well, and very cute.",73094,4
73094,The only thing is that they land higher on your waist than the picture shows so they end up over your belly button.,73094,4
73094,"I don't really mind since I typically wear a loose shirt over them anyway but just in case anyone doesn't want high waisted leggings, I thought it would be good to share.",73094,4
73095,So cute and so comfy...great for winter,73095,4
73098,"cute, but large for any newborn.",73098,4
73099,"I didn't expect this to be as ""flowy"" as the picture shows, as many shirts on Amazon are way smaller than what you expected.",73099,4
73099,This shirt is very wide and flowy at the bottom but it is a little short.,73099,4
73099,If it was a tiny bit longer it would be perfect!,73099,4
73100,"Fits good, just wish top was not so short.",73100,4
73100,Outfit is super cute though.,73100,4
73101,Seem to fit correctly and provide missing support.,73101,4
73102,Love this hat but the only thing I would change is the tie.,73102,4
73102,It comes untied very easy and my son pulls it off.,73102,4
73102,I would recommend adding a spring loaded button like the one on the back of the hat to the chin ties to help keep it on.,73102,4
73102,Otherwise it is great!,73102,4
73105,"The size is too small, looks spectacular the quality of the fabric is good really nice for that price I was expected something cheap  but not it is really amazing wearing this for my trip to ARUBA.",73105,4
73105,no matter what I'm going to wear like that.,73105,4
73106,This product is a totally great idea.,73106,4
73106,My husband never brings his reading glasses along when we go out.,73106,4
73106,Especially when he needs them.,73106,4
73106,But I ordered the wrong cover size.,73106,4
73106,"So, they will have to go back.",73106,4
73106,Plus my husband has a otter box protecting his iphone.,73106,4
73106,So he wouldn't be able to use this product.,73106,4
73106,If you could make just the pocket that the glasses fits into and allow it to stick to anything.,73106,4
73106,That would make it so all cell phone users can use it.,73106,4
73107,"Very comfortable, was a little big but not bad.",73107,4
73107,The colors are beautiful and I received several compliments on the dress.,73107,4
73108,"The cotton is soft and stretchy while still able to support, most cotton goes soft and baggy after a couple hours for me.",73108,4
73108,There was enough room in front and in back which I struggle with.,73108,4
73108,Only two things I wasn't 100% on.,73108,4
73108,"The front pouch is very wide and while its accommodating however it was very flat and doesn't really show as much as some other brands I've tried, good but just not as flattering.",73108,4
73108,"Also the brand name is quite large and screened on over the fabric, its really unflattering and I feel like it may feel off after several washes and being stretched.",73108,4
73108,It makes what would otherwise be a nice pair of underwear look cheap.,73108,4
73109,Very cute but the wings on the dress were not as cute,73109,4
73110,"I'm 5'2, 145-150 pounds, curvy figure.",73110,4
73110,I usually order medium in just about anything.,73110,4
73110,"However, the medium was a bit small.",73110,4
73110,"The photo has a pretty loose fitting style, but to achieve that look I would recommend going a size up.",73110,4
73111,Great active maternity pants.,73111,4
73111,"Only wish was that the material was somewhat more thinner and more breathable, but all around, I have loved wearing the pants when working out.",73111,4
73111,The belly gets covered and it's comfortable!,73111,4
73113,This necklace is very pretty.,73113,4
73113,"The pendant is not quite as sparkly as some of the reviews led me to believe it would be and that I had hoped, but the chain is delicate and makes the necklace look more pricy than it actually is.",73113,4
73113,I'm quite pleased with this purchase.,73113,4
73114,Logo was kinda faded?,73114,4
73114,Idk if it is supposed to be like that.,73114,4
73114,Other than that it fit and looked great,73114,4
73115,It is a decent ring.,73115,4
73115,I have had it for about six months now and it has not dinged or been scratched up.,73115,4
73115,The only downfall is that the sizing is a little off.,73115,4
73115,"It seems that they run a bit snug, which sadly makes it to the point that I can almost not wear mine comfortably.",73115,4
73115,"I wear a size 5.5 and that is what I ordered, but it felt similar to a 5.",73115,4
73115,So just be prepared to order a size or a half up so that you can wear the ring comfortably.,73115,4
73115,"Aside from sizing, the ring is absolutely beautiful.",73115,4
73115,"It can easily be used for ring stacking, but is also just a gorgeous band.",73115,4
73115,I originally bought it as a substitute to my large wedding ring.,73115,4
73115,"However, it stacks nicely underneath the ring's halo and looks stunning.",73115,4
73115,"It looks like real rose gold, and because the material is tungsten it does not scratch.",73115,4
73115,"Overall, a beautiful piece, it just runs a bit snug.",73115,4
73115,I would definitely buy again and would definitely recommend to a friend.,73115,4
73116,It was a gift and they  are  happy with it.,73116,4
73117,I love these pants.. runs small but I ordered 1 size bigger and they are awesome,73117,4
73118,This bra is really well made.,73118,4
73118,"The zipper is sturdy, seams are strong and clean, and the material has a nice supportive stretch.",73118,4
73118,"I'm 5'4"" and weight 180lbs, usually wear a lg for sports bras ( I like them tight) and an xl in tops.",73118,4
73118,"I got this in an XL, because Chinese sizing and such, and it fits pretty well.",73118,4
73118,"Not as long as it looked in the picture, but it's not too short.",73118,4
73118,The blue color of the bra I received is a nice medium royal blue with flecks of almost blue/lilac.,73118,4
73118,"Really pretty,  only problem is I  ORDERED an all black version.",73118,4
73118,"Overall, I like this sports bra.",73118,4
73118,"Is very stylish,  and I like the blue a lot, so I'm going to keep this one.",73118,4
73118,That is why it lost a star though.,73118,4
73119,Fit was as expected.,73119,4
73119,Very soft and very warm.,73119,4
73119,My only complaint is that they do not have the button at the top to cover the zipper.,73119,4
73119,I wanted these zippered pajamas because my little 18 month Houdini can undo the other types.,73119,4
73119,The button covering keeps him from getting to the zipper and unzipping himself.,73119,4
73119,However without that I've had a naked baby several mornings.,73119,4
73119,Because of this I wouldn't buy these again.,73119,4
73120,The clip was a little hard to open and close but other than that I love it.,73120,4
73121,I glad I got my son a size larger than normal!,73121,4
73122,"Great quality, but runs very small.",73122,4
73122,"Would buy again, just 1-2 sizes larger.",73122,4
73123,Nice quality and style.,73123,4
73124,It's cute but the shirt is too small for the pants.,73124,4
73124,"The sleeves are quarter length, not full length, and I will have to put sun screen on her belly in case she lifts her arms.",73124,4
73125,amazing quality for the price.,73125,4
73126,Very nice quality and fit perfect,73126,4
73128,I bought this for my son for his first Christmas this year.,73128,4
73128,He is almost 4 months old (will be 6mo at Christmas) but big for his age.,73128,4
73128,I noticed others commented this runs small so I bought a 12 month size.,73128,4
73128,It's wide but the length would fit him now and hopefully it still fits for Christmas.,73128,4
73128,I compared it to his other 6 month onesies and the length is about the same.,73128,4
73128,Buy a size up!,73128,4
73129,I like the ease of transferring everything from one purse to another...just grab the organizer and go.,73129,4
73129,The only issue is durability.,73129,4
73129,The material tore within a few months and does not close on the middle.,73129,4
73129,The 2 side zipped pockets are good.,73129,4
73129,lots of pockets and spaces.,73129,4
73130,Dones't look super expensive but still very nice.,73130,4
73130,"Pure white, which is difficult to come by and fits true to side.",73130,4
73132,It is hard to decipher how long the t shirt is from the picture.,73132,4
73132,"I was hoping it would be a tad bit longer, but I'll make it work.",73132,4
73133,"I got it, I liked it, the pants fit perfect on my waist but they're a little to loose on my legs, I'm 5'4 and 110 pounds and got an S. The material is good, it's safe to buy!",73133,4
73134,Was just too small for me.,73134,4
73134,I sent it back for a larger size.,73134,4
73135,Really cute & roomy!,73135,4
73135,"Good for light shopping or as an overnight bag, but I find it's more of a fashion piece vs. functional (e.g., would not use as book bag w/laptop).",73135,4
73135,"It has a funky smell at first, but if you open it & air it out for 2-3 days, it'll be fine (I put strong sachet in it).",73135,4
73135,"The material is thin, not very sturdy and the inside zipper pull on my bag was broken.",73135,4
73135,I lubricated the outside & main zippers because they tended to stick.,73135,4
73135,"But I love the look of this bag and for the price, I'm happy with it.",73135,4
73136,"For the weird one-size, this fits pretty much like I expected after reading reviews.",73136,4
73136,"I typically wear a small or xsmall top and this shirt is oversized on me, but that's on trend now.",73136,4
73136,It would likely be too small for anyone over a 38 chest.,73136,4
73137,these are sun glasses not shoes,73137,4
73138,Cool watch worth the money.,73138,4
73139,I love the color and the style but the dress does not fit like I want it too.,73139,4
73139,The top fits larger than expected.,73139,4
73140,"incredible product, especially for the price!",73140,4
73140,top is pretty small for size.,73140,4
73141,Pretty lacy summery shirt.,73141,4
73141,I'm actually going to wear it on Easter Sunday because it is as appropriate for special occasions as well as thrown on with a pair of jeans.,73141,4
73142,"Pretty, but the purple one I liked better.",73142,4
73143,"This is stylish, but not the best fabric.",73143,4
73143,My son loves it though.,73143,4
73144,Kind of cheap looking/thin but love the design.,73144,4
73145,"This umbrella is adorable, easy to operate, and seems relatively safe with no sharp corners or edges.",73145,4
73145,"When it arrived, it had some fine white powder on it, which was easily wiped away with a damp cloth.",73145,4
73145,It arrives in a large brown amazon box...it does not have its own brand/packaging.,73145,4
73146,The fabric is soft and the design is beautiful.,73146,4
73146,"I gave it 4 stars, because they run small.",73146,4
73146,"If you like your pajamas roomy, order a size up.",73146,4
73147,"For the price, a perfect hat....worked well for the event I was attending...the color gray will go with several colors.",73147,4
73148,I really like this a lot.,73148,4
73148,The needles are super sharp which makes things hurt way less.,73148,4
73148,I like to pierce my ears a lot and doing it by your self I super hard but they have clamps so you can hold still.,73148,4
73148,The only thing is the clamps get stuck and then the earring falls out.,73148,4
73148,So having someone else might help a lot.,73148,4
73150,"Got this just in time for the winter season to be over...Oh well, bagging it and waiting til next cold season!",73150,4
73151,It was for my son.,73151,4
73152,"Because these are Sperrys, I did have to order the shoe in a size smaller than my normal shoe size, but they are pretty good shoes.",73152,4
73152,The only reason these did not get 5 stars from me is because of the blisters they cause at first and the sizing problem.,73152,4
73152,"They are generally pretty comfortable and if you start with wearing them for just under an hour a day and then gradually breaking them in, you should be fine.",73152,4
73152,"They are not the worst shoes in terms of blisters, but they are slip-ons so be prepared to break them in.",73152,4
73153,Took awhile to ship but I do love this beanie.,73153,4
73153,Keeps me warm during the winter months and my boyfriend wants one too.,73153,4
73155,I really dig these pants.,73155,4
73155,"Thick enough material you can't see through, but thin enough that they are comfortable to work out in.",73155,4
73155,"Only downfall is they really bring out my ""dimples"".",73155,4
73156,"Great fit, very comfortable.",73156,4
73157,"Just choose your size based on the State, they will ship you the one that was adjusted to your size from Asian size;  if you choose bigger size due to the Asian size is smaller than the State size, hey you will get a way to big one.",73157,4
73157,They should emphasize that point in the description to avoid returning/operation cost,73157,4
73158,My wife laughed at me for getting it.,73158,4
73158,"When I put it on her, I make it a fun production( wow so pretty...) we don't use it often, but when we do, she keeps in on.",73158,4
73158,No falls yet so can't give feed back on that.,73158,4
73158,"even though it's only fabric and padding, I think it would be better then a direct head to tile impact.",73158,4
73159,"This is a very pretty, dainty necklace, but it is MUCH smaller than I thought it would be.",73159,4
73159,It's not really suited to an adult unless you have a tiny build.,73159,4
73159,"Rather than returning such a pretty little necklace, I'm going to save it for a gift for one of the kids in my life.",73159,4
73161,The sides are a LOT higher than in the photo it goes way up my hips,73161,4
73162,Went up about two sizes in order to have it fit properly.,73162,4
73162,Then it's cute for what it is.,73162,4
73163,"It's a very lovely scarf, nice feel and design.",73163,4
73163,The color I ordered was dark purple and the colors are very vivid and rich.,73163,4
73164,Just right fit to replace my aging insert,73164,4
73165,"Not for me, but the granddaughter seemed to like it.",73165,4
73165,Took a LOOOOOONG time to be delivered.,73165,4
73166,"Fits really large, recommend going down a size.",73166,4
73166,"Like if you're usually a 1x, go for an x instead.",73166,4
73166,"Decent material quality, washed well, pockets are cute!",73166,4
73167,really cute and looks good at the gym,73167,4
73168,I wear a 14 in most items including all of my swimsuits but this one I should've followed the suggestions and sized up.,73168,4
73168,So I am because this is a gorgeous swimsuit and I must owned it!,73168,4
73168,"Also, to give you a better idea; if it wasn't for my breasts the 14 would've been perfect.",73168,4
73168,*sighs* I will give it 5 stars once my replacement arrives.,73168,4
73170,Did shrink a little in the first wash.,73170,4
73171,"Beautiful dress, runs a bit small... Good thing I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I thought just in case!",73171,4
73172,"I bought this dress as a very last minute, cost effective dress for my brother's wedding.",73172,4
73172,"It fit very well, and definitely hugged my curves.",73172,4
73172,"The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because although it is a cute dress, the material/fit is obviously not expensive.",73172,4
73172,"I dressed it up well with my hair, jewelry and shoes (it does look a bit plain without being dolled up).",73172,4
73172,"Overall, I was satisfied!",73172,4
73173,I bought two sizes up and it was still a little tight but not uncomfortable.,73173,4
73174,Fits well but the top is not as long as the picture.,73174,4
73174,I'm sure it depends on the torso length.,73174,4
73175,Great choice for the price!,73175,4
73175,Fit well and was lined nicely,73175,4
73176,Has a lot of room.,73176,4
73176,I'm a size 20 in pants and this was big.,73176,4
73176,I like the way they look on.,73176,4
73176,I have to find a top to wear with it.,73176,4
73176,Any shoe goes well with these pants.,73176,4
73178,My wife loved this it was dainty which she liked especially for typing and I was extremely impressed,73178,4
73179,I love the suit it runs small like me but wish it had more chest coverage my nipples feel like they gonna pop out i love the side and the strings and the rest of the fit,73179,4
73180,Nice bags like it,73180,4
73182,It looks better with a denim jacket and boots.,73182,4
73183,"Love this top, but it was cut too small at the top and I have asked for a return.",73183,4
73183,It's a shame because it is beautiful fabric.,73183,4
73184,It was kind of big had to bring it in to fix,73184,4
73185,"Comfortable, easy to put on!",73185,4
73186,It is very nice and pretty.,73186,4
73186,Color and print is awesome.,73186,4
73187,It also arrived early.,73187,4
73187,It's definitely the same colors as the pic.,73187,4
73187,The only 2 things I can live w/o is the straps are extra thin.,73187,4
73187,And it's not flowy like in the pic.,73187,4
73187,But it's still long and pretty.,73187,4
73187,I give it 4 out of 5 stars,73187,4
73188,She was very happy to receive her twin pack.,73188,4
73188,The one thing she mentioned is the infinity necklace was bigger then she wanted.,73188,4
73188,From the pictures it looked a lot smaller than what it really was.,73188,4
73189,Only beef is it didn't come with a tag.,73189,4
73189,I didn't want the recipient to think it was used.,73189,4
73190,They were too small of a frame.,73190,4
73190,But I am sure they would work well,73190,4
73191,My 7 year old son asked to be Barf for Halloween this year.,73191,4
73191,The wig fits and is overall pretty amazing.,73191,4
73191,"My only complaint is that the ears don't stick up as easily, but that is something I should be able to fix.",73191,4
73192,Runs kinda small but not a lot.,73192,4
73192,One size up could be too big tho....,73192,4
73193,"Runs small, material is a bit on the cheap side, it's ok for everyday wear.",73193,4
73193,Very nice red color,73193,4
73194,Look good and fit good.,73194,4
73195,Not very slouchy but still a good quality  beanie.,73195,4
73196,Meets my usually high expectations.,73196,4
73196,"However, I wish it had been delivered in a nice box since it is a gift.",73196,4
73196,It came in a plastic jacket...,73196,4
73197,Very cute for the price!,73197,4
73198,"I got this for my mom and she loves it ,the watch itself is great and descent quality.",73198,4
73198,The chain is poor but still overall good,73198,4
73199,It was what I expected.,73199,4
73200,"Classy, small and simple",73200,4
73201,Great wallet for euro dollars,73201,4
73202,"Were a little gawdy, but for the price that's what you get.",73202,4
73202,My mother still loved them and they look great,73202,4
73203,I ordered a medium and needed a small.,73203,4
73203,I normally wear a small so I'm reordering.,73203,4
73204,I ordered this to be a tallit (prayer shawl) bag...,73204,4
73204,"When I got it in, it had a tallit inside!",73204,4
73204,Bonus and what a deal!,73204,4
73205,These are great and the price is fair.,73205,4
73205,They're soft and comfortable.,73205,4
73205,"Just a bit hard to work with it with one hand while holding the baby, but that goes with any bra I suppose.",73205,4
73206,"nice jacket, I got a small, but the sleeves were way too long for me.",73206,4
73207,Trying to figure out how to exchange it...,73207,4
73207,The paperwork is very vague,73207,4
73208,"Cute dress but in Junior sizes for instance the tag says XXL 14, so I would think XL 12, L 10, M 8, S 6, XS 4, XXS 2.",73208,4
73209,"Fabric feels nice, light and soft.",73209,4
73209,"Thought it would be longer, but the color is nice.",73209,4
73210,Great basic cheap black v neck!,73210,4
73211,"Button fell off as soon as I took them out of the bag, color is different than I expected (gray instead of White) so it doesn't match my shirt or hat but I'll keep them anyway.",73211,4
73212,My father loved it.,73212,4
73212,"The fabric is somewhat rough, but comfy.",73212,4
73214,"Cute shirt, fits well!",73214,4
73215,gets wrinkled easy and stiff but worth what I paid for it.,73215,4
73215,Fit exactly as described.,73215,4
73216,Saving it for Hawaii but I like everything about it so far.,73216,4
73217,Fast delivery and looks great,73217,4
73218,Fit a bit smaller than expected but was able to give it to my daughter and she loves it.,73218,4
73218,So it worked out.,73218,4
73220,It fits a little smaller that I thought it would.,73220,4
73220,"I typically wear a large but this large was a little more tight fitting than I like, plus it was shorter than I thought it would be.",73220,4
73221,"I love the pj set for my son; however, I ordered size 3T and it fits him pretty snug.",73221,4
73222,they're pretty good for mimicking what could be a ridiculously expensive sneaker,73222,4
73223,"I ordered a 4T for my 3 year old, 36lb son and 2T for my 25lb 20 month old.",73223,4
73223,Both sets were very short.,73223,4
73223,"For reference, my 3 year old just started wearing 4T in most clothes (Gymboree, Gap, etc), but he won't be wearing this 4T for very long.",73223,4
73223,It fits more like a 3T from those brands.,73223,4
73223,"It's a light flannel, so I layered a short sleeve t-short underneath for extra warmth.",73223,4
73224,I ordered the black in a large.,73224,4
73224,It's a unique looking top.,73224,4
73224,It is a little tight around the chest area because I do have a large chest.,73224,4
73224,But it's not hat bad that I won't wear it.,73224,4
73225,comfy for lounging around the house or quick runs,73225,4
73226,"These seem to be good leggings, I use them for running and have so far held up well, I got them in black and they can seem a tad bit sheer in certain lighting but, it's not obviously sheer, a person has to be really looking.",73226,4
73226,I don't recommend wearing these alone with a short shirt though (just to be on the safe side).,73226,4
73226,They fit well and don't move around or slide down on me.,73226,4
73226,They are good for warmer weather as they are not thick.,73226,4
73226,"Great price and works for what I got them for, good for someone who doesn't want to spent a lot on work out clothes.",73226,4
73228,Runs really big so go 2 sizes down.,73228,4
73228,I ordered a large and had to return it.,73228,4
73228,I am about to order size small..,73228,4
73229,"Cute, good quality, fit beautifully.",73229,4
73229,Great choice for a homecoming dress.,73229,4
73229,"Very stylish with an elegant look, respectable length & coverage",73229,4
73230,"the front clasp on the internal bra shifts around a bit, but its not really a problem, just a cosmetic issue that is resolved by the second compressive zip.",73230,4
73230,"the sizing was close enough for comfort, but feels like I still spill over a bit.",73230,4
73230,I appreciate the relatively nice zippers used in comparison to a similar product.,73230,4
73231,"Loved the outfit, and so did he.",73231,4
73231,"However the apron was not in english, so that oeice went in the trash.",73231,4
73231,I loved the rest of it.,73231,4
73233,I ordered a size small in US.,73233,4
73233,I just wish it was longer,73233,4
73234,A birthday gift for my step daughter she love it!,73234,4
73235,It's a nice tie.,73235,4
73235,It's a bit shorter than I was expecting it to be but it is as advertised.,73235,4
73235,Four starts because it is a bit thin near the point.,73235,4
73236,"Colorful, beads are pretty, seems good for the price.",73236,4
73237,Its cool and feels good just order a size up,73237,4
73240,"It is slightly tight and smelly at first, and they come badly wrinkled in the box.",73240,4
73240,But they work perfectly fine!!,73240,4
73240,I would like to report back on how they work after a couple of months of wear.,73240,4
73240,They tear super easily....Have torn 2 of them after wearing them each separately 4 times.,73240,4
73242,Somewhat small on the bust.,73242,4
73243,I didn't realize how big it was but it works ok,73243,4
73244,Some decent fake Oakley's,73244,4
73245,Super cute but material is made out of thick t shirt material.,73245,4
73245,Not sure how many times can wear and/or wash bc may stretch or fade.,73245,4
73245,But very flattering regardless.,73245,4
73246,"Nice shoes, but too large.",73246,4
73247,Very soft and comfortable.,73247,4
73248,I ordered a 12 but fit like an 11 but still like them have not worn yet,73248,4
73249,Bought it as a gift for my mother and she loved it!,73249,4
73249,"We're not too confident about the material, so she only wears it on occasion.",73249,4
73250,They were really cute.,73250,4
73250,I love the rainbow stitching.,73250,4
73250,Alittle smaller around the waist but it more like slims my stomache out which is cool.,73250,4
73250,But overall I like them.,73250,4
73250,I'm excited to wear them to dance next Tuesday!,73250,4
73253,"Super fast shipping, a bit too long but in all beautiful dress",73253,4
73255,great for pools - holds in poo (when it unfortunately happens) is great for under swimsuits.,73255,4
73257,A little large and did not shrink at all.,73257,4
73257,But better that way than the other.,73257,4
73258,I ordered these to replace the band that comes with the 42mm Moto 360 2nd Gen.,73258,4
73258,"Nothing wrong with the stock band, I'm just not a big fan of leather and it never fit quite right.",73258,4
73258,It was always just a little to small or big.,73258,4
73258,"These bands offer much more flexibility in fitment for some reason, I'm guessing because of how it threads through the pins.",73258,4
73258,Pros: The quality of the product is great.,73258,4
73258,Everything is as described.,73258,4
73258,"They include 4, 20mm pins, but for some reason don't put that in the description.",73258,4
73258,Cons: The strap length is to long.,73258,4
73258,"I have average to above average wrists and the proposed ""loop the strap back through"" method in the pictures looked and felt obnoxious.",73258,4
73258,I ended up cutting off about a centimeter and then used a soldering iron to melt the ends so that they don't fray.,73258,4
73261,It fits really good love how it looks,73261,4
73262,"It works for me, I bought a large but it fit like an extra large.",73262,4
73262,I'm ok with it though,73262,4
73263,"Overall, a great jersey.",73263,4
73263,Definitely runs smaller than normal.,73263,4
73263,All my cycling jerseys are XL and this XL fits like a large.,73263,4
73263,I would recommend buying 1 size larger than normal.,73263,4
73264,I would give this top 5 starts because it is adorable it fits me a little snug but i have a large bust.,73264,4
73264,I am glad i got the large .,73264,4
73264,The only complaint i have is it had a  strong chemical smell.,73264,4
73264,I so not understand why things shipped to made in China have this smell.,73264,4
73264,I will be taking it to the cleaners though I love the cute design,73264,4
73265,Item looks well built.,73265,4
73265,"I haven't  had the chance to use it yet, but I'm sure it will make link removal a breeze.",73265,4
73267,I had read reviews stating that the dress runs a bit large.,73267,4
73267,I was glad I listened and ordered a size down.,73267,4
73267,"The XS fits me (5'5"", 115lb) perfectly.",73267,4
73267,"The material is stretchy, and the dress is beautiful.",73267,4
73268,difficult to see out of them so you can't wear it for much longer than a photo op.,73268,4
73269,"These fit my 7 week old perfectly, my 6 yr old also put one on and it fit her too, a little bit snug though.",73269,4
73269,They are super cute!,73269,4
73269,"The only problem is that they smell terrible, I will have to try and wash them without ruining the cute knot.",73269,4
73269,My 2 yr old boy got a hold of one and somehow messed with the knot and now I can't figure out how to get it back to what it's suppose to look like.,73269,4
73269,"If I can get the smell out, I love them!",73269,4
73269,"Seriously though, it made my baby's head stink, I had to go wash her.",73269,4
73269,"The smell washed right out and once you figure it out, the knot part fixes right up!",73269,4
73270,ONLY WISH THERE WAS A LARGER INSIDE POCKET -  OTHERWISE I LOVE THE SIZE...I WILL ORDER IN ANOTHER COLOR TOO !,73270,4
73271,"The shirt is a little shorter than I prefer, but a soft, comfy material.",73271,4
73272,"Nice, warm, and comfortable.",73272,4
73272,I enjoy these very much.,73272,4
73273,These are good to get when your child is first starting to walk.,73273,4
73273,"I liked these a lot for my oldest daughter, and they are easy to slip on and off",73273,4
73274,not one of my best dresses but it looks ok,73274,4
73275,This shirt is wonderful.,73275,4
73275,The size and fit are as expected.,73275,4
73275,The colors are as expected.,73275,4
73275,Would definitely purchase again.,73275,4
73276,I am only 12 days post c section and have been wearing these for 5 days so it's too early to tell if they really work.,73276,4
73276,They do pinch/roll a bit at top band a bit like Spanx.,73276,4
73276,I am a size 8-10 pre pregnancy and debated between S/M and L/XL and went with the latter and glad I did.,73276,4
73276,One big bummer is that it says hand wash and air dry only (but I did dry on low before I saw that).,73276,4
73276,Hope these help with the scar but it's too early to tell.,73276,4
73277,The necklace is very pretty.,73277,4
73277,"It seems shorter than I imagined, will need to use an extender to get it to the length that I want.",73277,4
73277,Doesn't look cheaply made.,73277,4
73278,The red bow tie is accurately portrayed in the picture online.,73278,4
73278,The quality is good.,73278,4
73278,"My one issue with it is that the closure clip in directly under the chin and thus makes it very hard to get on, adjusted, and straightened with your child still happy with it!",73278,4
73278,The older the child the better the outcome with this product I feel.,73278,4
73279,I was very happy when I received them !,73279,4
73279,They are light weight and seem a little delicate but I still think it's a great buy for the price :),73279,4
73280,Just make sure it's Abbot and Main.,73280,4
73280,"Fits right, good material.",73280,4
73282,My son loves these and we have seen other kids from around the state in these soccer boots too.,73282,4
73282,He spends all day in them during tournaments.,73282,4
73284,"The material not as good, and the color faded after play at beach just one day!",73284,4
73285,We went to a water park and lost one of the lenses in the first hour.,73285,4
73285,I was just holding it when it happened.,73285,4
73285,My son likes them and they fit his large head.,73285,4
73286,"I'm 5'6"", 185 lbs, 38B, and bottom heavy.",73286,4
73286,"Got the 3XL, and it fit pretty good!",73286,4
73286,"Nothing was too tight, which I usually really worry about around my thighs/hips.",73286,4
73286,Couldnt fill in the top all of the way and it's super intensely padded.,73286,4
73286,That's the only reason I rated this 4 out of 5.,73286,4
73287,"Purchased for my daughter, who loves it.",73287,4
73288,Chain sucks if are aggressive or on the constant run otherwise it's awesome to wear!,73288,4
73288,I love this necklace though,73288,4
73290,Very good cowboy hat for the price .,73290,4
73290,Used for our ranch family vacation,73290,4
73291,A little small and not for extremely long wear,73291,4
73292,"They're pretty good, I would've given it 5 stars if some of them weren't broken (like 2 or 3).",73292,4
73293,Got them for myself as a little gift.,73293,4
73293,"They are a bit on the small size, its difficult to see that the 'gem' is actually a heart.",73293,4
73293,But they are cute!,73293,4
73294,I little small through the shoulders.,73294,4
73295,"Fathers day gift for Pops, worked out well.",73295,4
73295,Showed up on time.,73295,4
73296,They are great for this price.,73296,4
73297,Beautiful but stone was broken;( I had to send it back .,73297,4
73298,"Well made, fits well around the neckline and the colors are vibrant and pretty.",73298,4
73298,Arrived on time and well packaged.,73298,4
73299,Pretty much as expected.,73299,4
73299,The reviews seemed to say they run large so I ordered a size down.,73299,4
73299,All in all they are comfortable.,73299,4
73299,I'll know better after the first wash.,73299,4
73300,As expected from most other CUPSHE suits this does have Asian sizing so size up!,73300,4
73301,Felt good knowing my daughter was protected from the sun.,73301,4
73301,Was a little big hut the strap was nice so if it fell off it didn't go far.,73301,4
73301,I like how wide the brim is to protect her shoulders,73301,4
73302,This backless Bodycon Spaghetti dress is perfect for a fun night out on the town.,73302,4
73302,The dress is very form fitting as it hugs all your curves (good and bad).,73302,4
73302,"There is also a crisscross design in front that comes is very sexy and gies the appearance that you might have a peek-a-boo moment, but surprisingly, the dress did not ride up on me even after a night of dancing.",73302,4
73302,The skirt is made up of polyester and the top appears to be spandex.,73302,4
73302,The tope is held up by tying the material at the back of the nec and also at the middle of the back.,73302,4
73302,Your entire back will be out that adds to the sexiness.,73302,4
73302,"Since the top ties to fit, the top can accommodate women of various breasts sizes.",73302,4
73302,The bottom is a peach color that contrasts very well with the black top.,73302,4
73302,The design is excellent as it strikes the perfect balance between elegance and sexiness.,73302,4
73302,I took one star away because the problem with the dress is the material.,73302,4
73302,"The material is very thin, which makes it a necessity to wear panties that match the color of the skirt.",73302,4
73302,"Furthermore, pantylines may show through.",73302,4
73302,"Also the top is very thin, which means nipple covers may be needed depending on where this item will be worn and how prudish you are.",73302,4
73302,I wore it at night and my breasts were not visible.,73302,4
73302,"Lastly, ladies dress this dress up!",73302,4
73302,I wore some cute Michael Kors heels and paired it with a Michael Kors purse and jewelry and got compliments all night long.,73302,4
73302,"For the price, this dress is excellent and perfect for a fun hot summer night out!",73302,4
73303,This was too small for me but it fit my nice perfectly,73303,4
73304,The box that this ring came in you should not use to gift it.,73304,4
73304,"Very nice color stone, just a bit bigger than I thought it would be but I have very short fingers.",73304,4
73304,Great price quick delivery.,73304,4
73306,I have salvaged a pair of boots and a pair of athletic shoes so far that were irritating my bunion.,73306,4
73306,The product works just as described and I am very happy with it.,73306,4
73307,The body is as expected but the hood portion is a little smaller than I expected.,73307,4
73307,It maybe the weight of the garment makes the hood feel smaller.,73307,4
73307,I used mine the other day and I was so glad I had it.,73307,4
73307,I keep in my car for that unexpected downpour.,73307,4
73307,I felt unwell and was so glad to have the comfort and warmth of this product.,73307,4
73308,My second pair of these.,73308,4
73308,Hard to find adult sunglasses that fit a small face.,73308,4
73308,"Even these aren't small enough, but smallest I can find in adult sunglasses.",73308,4
73308,They don't sell bifocal sunglasses in children's sizes!,73308,4
73308,Before I lost my close vision I always wore kids sunglasses.,73308,4
73308,Please make these in more colors!,73308,4
73308,I love blue and pink and purple!,73308,4
73308,"These say wine, but they're a very dark red.",73308,4
73308,What's with the tortoise shell color?,73308,4
73308,Every style of sunglasses come in tortoise shell and black.,73308,4
73308,Five stars when I can get them in a new cool color!,73308,4
73309,"Works just like it should, the only reason I did not give a 5 star was the sleeves were not as dark as the picture made it seem.",73309,4
73310,"I have the black version in the same size and it fits perfectly fine, but for some reason the white runs a little smaller, its a very good product for its price.",73310,4
73311,Keeps my ears warm as expected.,73311,4
73312,Fits and looks nice on me.,73312,4
73313,Good little water shoes for the price.,73313,4
73313,The fit is on the smaller side but I prefer these to Crocs - the snug fit allows my toddler to run around more easily in them.,73313,4
73313,By the end of the season they were showing a lot of wear and tear - I think Crocs might be more durable - but given the price I could have stomached buying a replacement pair.,73313,4
73314,Very comfortable and cute.,73314,4
73314,i would suggest ordering one size bigger than you are because its a non-stretchy material,73314,4
73315,Great products at a great price.,73315,4
73315,Beginner to this sport.,73315,4
73316,I purchased the Kemyer 15 Inch Underseater Carry-on Wheeled Luggage for a trip to Japan.,73316,4
73316,It was a very smart looking blue and it was easy to wheel around and through the aisle of the plane.,73316,4
73316,"Since it was a very long flight, I wanted something I could access easily when I needed something.",73316,4
73316,The Kemyer 15 Inch Underseater Carry-on Wheeled Luggage fit the bill.,73316,4
73316,It fit under the seat without difficulty and I was able to easily access items that I needed.,73316,4
73316,It did hold more than my previous wheeled carry on.,73316,4
73316,"I could it was easy to pack when it was laying down, so that I could more readily access them from under the seat.",73316,4
73316,I think I might have been able to pack more but the zippers seemed to kink around the curves where zipped and I was afraid that they would break.,73316,4
73316,That is the reason that I gave only 4 stars.,73316,4
73318,"It looks good, works well, and many people have given complimented me.",73318,4
73318,"But it has to be re-wound almost daily, and that's annoying.",73318,4
73318,Still it's a good deal.,73318,4
73319,I purchased a grey and green color.,73319,4
73319,The green fits best and has a harder material.,73319,4
73319,Both are very nice and the style at neck area is unique.,73319,4
73320,"The teeth are great, and look fantastic, and very realistic!",73320,4
73320,My only issue is the plastic stuff that's supposed to make them attach to your teeth.,73320,4
73320,"I could never get it to work, and ended up not using them for the costume I bought them for, which was a real disappointment.",73320,4
73320,"It's entirely possible I wasn't doing it right, and after so many failed attempts, the plastic became more and more impossible to work with.",73320,4
73320,"I'll find a way to make the teeth work, because I love them, and I really want to be able to wear them!",73320,4
73321,Very complicated to put on and the lacing was arduous but the look was definitely what I'm going for.,73321,4
73321,My boyfriend really liked it.,73321,4
73321,I recommend you put your g string on over these or wear crotchless panties like I did.,73321,4
73321,I don't regret buying it and it is strong enough to wear for multiple sessions.,73321,4
73322,I loved this shirt when I got it.,73322,4
73322,I tried it on and the small fit great (I usually wear a small).,73322,4
73322,The only complaint that I have is that the bottom of it is a little more 'flowy' than I would have liked.,73322,4
73323,Really good looking build I'm now convinced this is real leather so I'm going through hold back my one star,73323,4
73324,"This skirt runs very small in my opinion, especially by the butt/thighs (could just be my body), so I bought a very big size and will pay to have it taken it bc I really like the skirt.",73324,4
73325,Gave them to a girl friend of mine... to sparkly for a guy in my opinion...,73325,4
73326,A little wider would feel and look better.,73326,4
73328,Got the feathers version.,73328,4
73328,Love the bright colors.,73328,4
73328,"Definitely better for the thinner ladies, but it still brought compliments for my 1x!",73328,4
73328,"I put a black tank under, so no issues with the top.",73328,4
73328,"I'm good size up top, and it was flattering.",73328,4
73328,Used with a black bolero jacket to cover my arms.,73328,4
73328,And easy to wear.,73328,4
73329,Very nice robe and slippers.,73329,4
73330,"When this first came out of the package, they looked very small for my size 10 frame .",73330,4
73330,The pants do have a good amount of stretch and hold.,73330,4
73330,"With that being said, part of the design on the bum of the pants is see-through as you can see in the pictures.",73330,4
73330,The top is great for my 36 DD at high impact  training.,73330,4
73330,"The bottoms will only be worn at home, for the benefit of my fianc.",73330,4
73331,"Happy with the Dress, After contacting the seller, the Dress was received within two days.",73331,4
73331,Original date for delivery did not get here but seller quickly resolved the shipping delay with immediate shipping.,73331,4
73331,Dress looks just like picture.,73331,4
73331,Size 10 fit as expected.,73331,4
73331,The bust is a little big.,73331,4
73331,"My daughter is 5'9""  146lbs.",73331,4
73331,worried about the length but its perfect.,73331,4
73331,Very pleased with dress compared to what we had previously looked at in Bridal shops.,73331,4
73331,Would buy from seller again in the future.,73331,4
73332,My granddaughter liked these pjs so much that she wanted to wear them for daytime.,73332,4
73332,"So I let her, of course.",73332,4
73333,Fits really nicely the top is not vneck decent quality for what your paying.,73333,4
73333,I definitely recommend this and would buy it again,73333,4
73334,Fit was a little large though.,73334,4
73335,"I wear a size 8-10, so I bought a  size large in case I wanted to wear a sweater under the coat.",73335,4
73335,It was very tight.,73335,4
73335,I returned the large and got an extra large.,73335,4
73335,"The XL is a little tight in the chest, but I am keeping it.",73335,4
73335,The coat is very warm and stylish.,73335,4
73336,"Was very afraid of ordering this dress but took a leap of faith, ordered it and i was quite pleased when i got it!!",73336,4
73336,The dress looks amazing!!,73336,4
73336,Not to mention the price was amazing!!,73336,4
73336,I do have one complaint and it is that it's extremely tight around the mid/lower thighs but hopefully a little alterations will fix that.,73336,4
73336,I did order a size up also.,73336,4
73337,The color is beautiful and my baby love it!,73337,4
73338,The clasp is silver although it was gold in the picture.,73338,4
73338,The brim is longer than I wanted so I returned it.,73338,4
73339,I really enjoy this barbell.,73339,4
73339,My industrial had to be pierced on the shorter side due to me having smaller ears and it is really hard to find a barbell that fits perfectly and this one does!,73339,4
73339,The quality of this item is top notch and I have had no issues with sensitivity which is impressive.,73339,4
73339,This item has held up very well the past few months that I have owned it and I get a lot of compliments on it.,73339,4
73339,I would give this item 5 stars however one thing that really doesn't work for me about this item is how inflexible it is.,73339,4
73339,If it gets the slightest touch it doesn't move or allow my ear to bend.,73339,4
73339,I have to wear my barbells 24/7 and this is the worst one to sleep in.,73339,4
73339,It has very little give.,73339,4
73339,However that being said it is also one of my favorites in my collection at the moment.,73339,4
73339,I can easily brush my hair and nothing gets caught up in it which is a huge bonus.,73339,4
73339,Overall the quality of this item is amazing and I recommend it but just remember there is little give so if you have a healing piercing this may be one to save and show off when things are fully healed.,73339,4
73340,I am brand new to wearing sleep masks.,73340,4
73340,I've been trying everything I can think of to stop the dry eye effects of the surgeries I've had to undergo to my lower left eyelid.,73340,4
73340,"These surgeries resulted in losing most of the lower outside corner of my bottom eyelid, leaving more of my eye exposed and making that eye remain partially open as I sleep.",73340,4
73340,"My granddaughter gave me the bright idea of the sleep mask, but I couldn't decide which type to get.",73340,4
73340,So I purchased this YUEDGE contoured mask and the Alaska Bear traditional style satin sleep mask with dual straps.,73340,4
73340,I tried this YUEDGE first and liked it very much - except there is no adjusting the back strap.,73340,4
73340,"I fall asleep on my side every night but switch back and forth to my back through the night, and the lack of ability to tighten this mask was the only complaint I could come up with.",73340,4
73340,I love that my eyelids aren't touched by the mask.,73340,4
73340,"It makes wearing it almost weightless, and it did help some with preventing the air from drying out my eye.",73340,4
73340,"However, it wasn't 5-star perfect because I couldn't get a solid seal by tightening that strip...

...until I used both masks together.",73340,4
73340,":-D

So glad I purchased both - the adjustable dual-strap traditional mask over this contoured mask fit the bill perfectly.",73340,4
73340,A word for those concerned with the dye discoloring your bedclothes.,73340,4
73340,Soak your sleep mask in vinegar water and wash by hand after a couple of hours.,73340,4
73340,Then hang to dry.,73340,4
73340,The vinegar helps set the dye so it won't run.,73340,4
73341,"Nice ,a bright navy as opposed to dark navy.",73341,4
73342,"good product
good parcel service
good design
I recommend it!",73342,4
73343,"However, I can't give five stars.",73343,4
73343,It runs small around the mid section and large around the top.,73343,4
73343,Not everyone who is over weight has a large chest.,73343,4
73343,"Don't have time to return and find a new dress, so having to have it altered to fit my chest.",73343,4
73344,I believe that only time or surgery will cure plantar faciitis.,73344,4
73344,But these inserts have relieved quite a bit of the pain.,73344,4
73345,Lovely sleeping gown for nursing or expecting moms.,73345,4
73345,"I usually wear US size 6, so this gown in size M was a bit too big for me.",73345,4
73345,"The fabric feels good on skin, will use it anyway, very comfortable.",73345,4
73346,Pretty large so hard to wear discretely,73346,4
73347,fits good and very soft,73347,4
73348,I love it fits true to size,73348,4
73349,Perfect piece for the price,73349,4
73350,This was a gift for my father.,73350,4
73350,It arrived on time and he lived it.,73350,4
73350,It is sturdy and polished.,73350,4
73351,love it so comfortable and warm.,73351,4
73352,I'm 5'2 and 120 pounds and I ordered a size medium and it fits perfectly.,73352,4
73352,it arrived as expected and so far I'm loving it!,73352,4
73352,can't wait to see results!,73352,4
73353,Just a little smaller than expected.,73353,4
73353,I have some more of the same shirts that I bought at the outlet store and they have been washed multiple times and still fit the same.,73353,4
73353,Its ok....Ill still wear them and they are great t shirts.,73353,4
73354,"I gave mine away, probably could've stretched them out but make sure to order at least a size up.",73354,4
73354,The thumb opening and width at the wrist were what was super-tight.,73354,4
73354,"My hands are usually a medium/large, and I thought a large would do, but these ended up sized for my son's petite girlfriend perfectly.",73354,4
73354,Quality and value are superb.,73354,4
73356,Very pretty...fit is true to size,73356,4
73358,Nice wide waist band.,73358,4
73358,"The cut up the butt checks are a little high for my taste, but not bad.",73358,4
73359,As well as expected.,73359,4
73359,Allows you to walk inside and outside of pool,73359,4
73360,My wife loved them except for the clip on the back of the ear ring.,73360,4
73360,Removed the clip and it works fine now,73360,4
73361,Just remember when you adjust it you cut off the tabs you don't use so the rubber doesn't get in the way of the clasp.,73361,4
73361,Me and the jeweler at Wal Mart had trouble figuring that out for a minute lol.,73361,4
73361,"Great look though, good feel, solid thickness so it doesn't feel like a cheap Casio band.",73361,4
73362,The fabric is very soft and comfortable.,73362,4
73362,They are great for layering.,73362,4
73363,I got this for  alittle over $5.,73363,4
73363,Buying any item in that price range you expect it as not many uses type of wear.,73363,4
73363,It is a beautiful design and close to as pictured which surprised me.,73363,4
73363,It is a good size for many average size necks.,73363,4
73363,I am 31 average weight for my height and it fits great on the tighter settings.,73363,4
73363,The design is cute very goth but also girlie.,73363,4
73363,The gem was tilted a bit not perfectly straight for those with ocd I took off a star because it had that small defect many cant notice but I do .,73363,4
73363,It is costume type jewelry I don't expect many uses out of this but it would definitely last at least three wears.,73363,4
73363,Mine came packaged fine with no damage except the red gem tilted.,73363,4
73363,I will add photos and I hope this review was helpful to you !,73363,4
73363,It is lightweight and you do have the option to make it tight or loose which is great !,73363,4
73364,A little larger than it should be in my size,73364,4
73365,Really nice shoes and they had an extra skate wheel which made them a little bit safer and easier for my 10 year old to use.,73365,4
73365,They have been warn constantly over the last 2 months and they have held up well.,73365,4
73365,Shoes were delivered as promised in good condition.,73365,4
73365,Great transaction all the way around.,73365,4
73366,It is adorable but it runs small - couldn't use it on my granddaughter.,73366,4
73367,I like it but the fitting is a bit huge,73367,4
73368,These gloves are really warm and they fit really well.,73368,4
73369,Looks good and is as described,73369,4
73371,Nice I didn't expect good  Quality for the price but I was so wrong I would recommend Amazon to everyone,73371,4
73372,"Nice watch , small face",73372,4
73373,"Very good the only issue is, no functional chin strap.",73373,4
73373,But I would buy it again!,73373,4
73374,"These are excellent for wear, but the black dye they use takes FOREVER to get out.",73374,4
73374,I've washed these three times by hand and still get some residue.,73374,4
73375,"I love the shirt and a quality, I should have ordered a medium instead of a large as it's a bit big, hopefully I can shrink it!",73375,4
73377,I ordered c the one wolf and got a the two wolves .. i like it but i was hoping for the one wolf picture :(,73377,4
73378,"A little large which is fine, if I gain a few pounds I'll still be able to wear the dress in comfort.",73378,4
73380,Even thoe it was not finsh i love it,73380,4
73381,"Customer service was great the shorts were OK
 I really enjoyed the shorts but unfortunately after the first wash the blue accent faded through the pink material and I could not wear them as I wanted to
 Contacted customer service and they were very helpful in getting me a return
I did order another pair in a different color and I love them",73381,4
73382,Well made and very stylish.,73382,4
73382,One star off for sizing.,73382,4
73382,The L/XL is about a 7-1/2 size.,73382,4
73382,No options in this style for those in the 7-3/4 and up club.,73382,4
73383,The armpits were a bit snug.,73383,4
73383,I could still lift my arms but it was tight.,73383,4
73383,I ordered a large which is what I wear in tops.,73383,4
73384,"A little large, but great for glare and very comfortable!",73384,4
73384,The case was an awesome surprise!,73384,4
73386,"I didn't like the plastics they came in... mum and dad haven't complained so far, so I guess they are ok",73386,4
73388,Only thing I didn't like is the straps on the shoulder kept falling Down off my shoulder.,73388,4
73388,If I make them tighter it would not fit as well.,73388,4
73388,Love the colors though,73388,4
73389,Nice looks just like your sample photo.,73389,4
73390,The fabric is really cheap but for the price is ok.,73390,4
73390,It was to wear only one time .,73390,4
73391,"Smelled a bit when I first opened it up, but fits nicely and great for the price",73391,4
73392,"I absolutely love this ring...too much, I guess, because the silver color turned copper and it's wearing off completely.",73392,4
73392,Otherwise I love it so much.,73392,4
73393,The sublimation process is not perfect.,73393,4
73393,Expect small imperfections in seems and creases.,73393,4
73394,The picture kind of was misleading to me.,73394,4
73394,I was not expecting the neckline that it had.,73394,4
73394,I wore it to a scholarship fundraiser and it was an overall winner.,73394,4
73394,"With the right foundation garments and a slip, all my curves and bumps were in the right places.",73394,4
73395,"I ordered a medium,based on my clothes size (going off my pants size, since I'm pear shaped).",73395,4
73395,Large is a little tight on my butt but a good fit for a bathing suit.,73395,4
73395,"The top fits really well which is a shock, because I normally wear 4-6 in US womens sizes for tips.",73395,4
73395,"Basically, if you carry any weight on your butt or boobs, you should seriously consider going up a size or two.",73395,4
73395,"All in all, the fabric is nice and thick, and it's comfy and looks exactly as advertised.",73395,4
73397,Comfortable and warm.. i tried using the gloves for when i go out to fly my drone and its cold.. i cant use the gloves when using the controller.,73397,4
73398,"My 18 month old daughter wears a show size 6, I purchased a size 7 to have room to grow all summer long, and extra room when it's difficult to put on a child's shoe when their feet and shoes are soaking wet.",73398,4
73398,"However, when putting them on, they fall off as she walks and seems as though they are actually 2 sizes too big.",73398,4
73398,We will see how well they hold up.,73398,4
73399,Cute necklace but probably won't last more than 6 months due to the fact that it's cheaply made and the gold on the necklace will tarnish quickly.,73399,4
73399,For the price it's a great disposable necklace.,73399,4
73400,"Pretty good, but needs XL size for large chests with regular length sleeves.",73400,4
73400,The old military XL-Reg worked well.,73400,4
73401,Good for a 2nd grader in a flag football league on natural grass.,73401,4
73401,"He has high arches, so I needed to swap out the laces for elastic laces for a more comfortable on-off process while they are being broken in.",73401,4
73401,Heel is reinforced and overall the cleat portion it sturdy and does its job.,73401,4
73401,"They also look cool, which is a plus to any elementary-aged child.",73401,4
73402,it is smaller than I thought it would be,73402,4
73403,I've used this bag on a number of trips and have had no issues with anything breaking like other customers have experienced.,73403,4
73403,The bag holds a deceivingly large amount of things as evidence by the images and list below.,73403,4
73403,"This bag easily fits in an airplane overhead storage, even on the smaller planes where the roll aboards have to be checked plane side.",73403,4
73403,My only issue is that the shoulder strap can be uncomfortable after carrying the bag for a while.,73403,4
73403,It would be nice if there was some sort of padding.,73403,4
73403,"Items in bag:
1 pair of boots
1 pair of jeans
5 t-shirts
1 pair of gym shorts
5 pairs of underwear
5 pairs of socks
1 bar of soap in box
1 quart size ziploc bag with toiletries
1 puzzle book
3 boxes of Maple Cream Cookies",73403,4
73404,The quality is very nice.,73404,4
73404,It's a bit of a tight fit for the credit cards but it should adjust over time.,73404,4
73404,The I Phone 6 plus fits nicely as well.,73404,4
73404,Quality exceeds the cost.,73404,4
73405,I like it really nice for well,73405,4
73406,Had to guess the sizes so 4 stars for that.,73406,4
73406,Other than that the kids love them!,73406,4
73407,My husband wanted something different so I ordered him this.,73407,4
73407,When it came it was a little tight so i just gave it to my son and ordered my husband another one..,73407,4
73407,It fits this time.,73407,4
73407,But when ordering i would order half size to size bigger because of how thick the band is.,73407,4
73407,Its a nice mans ring.,73407,4
73408,My husband loved this wallet.,73408,4
73408,The size and weight is perfect for him.,73408,4
73408,The only thing he would change is making the clasp that holds it closed a little more sturdy.,73408,4
73408,"If the wallet is dropped from when an inch above the counter/table/dresser, it pops open.",73408,4
73408,I still recommend it though!,73408,4
73409,This was a gift for a friend and she loved it.,73409,4
73409,"The quality is beautiful, simple and elegant.",73409,4
73410,1-2 sizes too small.,73410,4
73410,"No give in the fabric, however high quality material, and well made.",73410,4
73410,"The high low effect is not quite as obvious as what is pictures, which I liked.",73410,4
73411,"Gauge size was far larger than my original piercing, but I was able to get it through after a few minutes.",73411,4
73411,"The balls on the back were difficult to screw on, and require a great deal of patience (I think I've lost at least two so far).",73411,4
73411,"All of my jewelry came in good condition, except that the pink seemed slightly...murky in coloration.",73411,4
73411,Overall exactly what I was expecting.,73411,4
73412,Medium weight fabric which is thicker than another tux shirt I have.,73412,4
73412,Had to have it pressed as it was kind of wrinkled out of the bag.,73412,4
73412,"Button holes correct size for buttons, which means cuff buttons are not so tight that someone has to help me.",73412,4
73413,I love this so much.,73413,4
73413,I wore it in a photoshoot and other than a slight wardrobe malfunction (because I was wearing a bra) it looked amazing!,73413,4
73413,"I did end up sewing the sleeves tighter, they were very baggy around my wrist and looked a bit homely.",73413,4
73413,Other than that this is awesome.,73413,4
73414,I did not realize how big the glasses are.,73414,4
73414,I don't want to give the glasses themselves a low rating as they come in a nice holder and appear to be well made.,73414,4
73414,"However, they are way too big for my face.",73414,4
73415,Very beautiful I think my aunt like it,73415,4
73417,The dress is beautiful.,73417,4
73417,The only thing I don't like about the dress is the way it's kinda cheaply stitched by the cut outs on the sides.,73417,4
73417,The sew job wasn't smooth and when you have it on it looks kinda bulky or loose on the sides.,73417,4
73417,Maybe that only happens when smaller women wear the dress as opposed to a more fuller woman who would fill it out better.,73417,4
73417,Overall the dress is really nice.,73417,4
73417,"Probably would look better on a 5'5""+ and 135 lbs or better body type.",73417,4
73417,"It's kinda too long on my 5'2"" frame.",73417,4
73419,No  complaints very satisfied.,73419,4
73420,Just runs a bit to big.,73420,4
73421,"I am 5'1, and weight approx.",73421,4
73421,108 lbs; about 34B with a medium sized bum.,73421,4
73421,"I ordered a size Small bikini, and the bottoms fit nicely.",73421,4
73421,The top is a little loose...I wish my breasts were either bigger or they carried a XS.,73421,4
73421,"Preferably the former, haha.",73421,4
73421,"Anyway, worth the price, wish it were padded but still looks good.",73421,4
73422,Not bad just runs a little small!,73422,4
73423,"Good purchase, cloth is heavy, good for winter over leggings with something underneath.",73423,4
73423,The white  stitching looks classy.,73423,4
73424,Got this as a gift for my best friend and she loved it.,73424,4
73424,"I did find that when I went to test the zipper, they were stiff and didn't move easily.",73424,4
73424,"There are ways to fix the zipper though, so don't let that discourage you!",73424,4
73425,They were perfect and exactly what I was looking for and got here in a timely manner,73425,4
73427,They fit as expected and are super cute!,73427,4
73428,I just got this through the mail today and I am so in love with this set!,73428,4
73428,I tried it on and it instantly made me feel girly and flirty.,73428,4
73428,I can't wait to wear it for my hubby!,73428,4
73429,did the trick though very small and hard to work with.,73429,4
73430,"kinda short even though im only 5'1, but other than tht its rlly cute",73430,4
73431,Little tricky at first figuring how to set it.,73431,4
73431,You just have to push in the little spinner/cog thing to get the second hand moving.,73431,4
73431,The back of the watch doesn't look like it will come off without a lot of fuss.,73431,4
73431,It's really cute and has two snap on points to adjust the fit.,73431,4
73431,Will have to see how long the battery lasts.,73431,4
73432,"Love the style of this shirt, and the fabric is light weight and made of a beautiful blend material.",73432,4
73432,"I normally wear a XL, and that is what I ordered, but is a little snug.",73432,4
73432,"If your going to order, which I highly suggest you do, buy one size larger.",73432,4
73433,A beautiful piece of jewelry.,73433,4
73433,My teenager was pleasantly surprised and proudly wore it on a special occasion.,73433,4
73434,One stone glued slightly off but not really noticable and I am assuming an easy fix if I should desire to do so.,73434,4
73435,nice basic vest - drapes agreeably to compliment one's figure,73435,4
73436,For a work shoe these are not bad at all.,73436,4
73436,I have many pairs of non slip work shoes that I could not stand comfort wise.,73436,4
73436,These look much closer to a normal tennis shoe.,73436,4
73436,My only complain is that my feet feel like they are suffocating after a long day because there are not any vents for them to get air.,73436,4
73437,"Great dress but to short for 5'6""",73437,4
73438,"Could have got a size bigger, but I like wearing my heels small.",73438,4
73438,"Love everything about them, BUT the only problem I have is they have no traction what so ever.",73438,4
73438,There good for if you'll be walking on carpet or some type of floor with some type of traction.,73438,4
73438,Other than that they're perfect.,73438,4
73439,"For the price, this veil is wonderful.",73439,4
73439,"It needs a few little touches, I will trim the ends of the lace so they aren't just cut off square like they are now.",73439,4
73439,"Before I bought this veil, I was thinking about making my own but I discovered that the materials from the fabric store would be over $100.",73439,4
73439,This is a good deal for a crafty person because you will get all the lace and the tulle for a very good price and then just put a little bit more work into it to make it perfect.,73439,4
73439,I am very happy that I bought this instead of the $200 veil from the bridal boutique because this veil looks almost identical and after I make some adjustments I think it will be perfect.,73439,4
73440,It' a tad snug thru the bust for me but I am large busted...very cute.,73440,4
73440,I wear with leggings,73440,4
73441,Love the style but fit very strange.,73441,4
73441,Why not have the back and neck straps tie so they are adjustable and would give a better fit.,73441,4
73441,The back strap needs to be a tie so it can be adjusted more instead of just one size.,73441,4
73441,If the back was adjustable on the top it would have definitely been a big hit!,73441,4
73442,Love the stretch feature of the waist,73442,4
73443,"Works great for our 4 year old son, he can be out in the wind and cold and is still very warm",73443,4
73444,So i love this but tbh it was way shorter than i expected.,73444,4
73444,"Regardless, super comfortable, easy to wear.",73444,4
73444,A great buy for spring/summer months,73444,4
73445,I got this shirt for my husband so we could be a rum & Coke for a Halloween party.,73445,4
73446,FOR THE PRICE IT IS MADE FAIRLY WELL.,73446,4
73447,Feminine and delicate style.,73447,4
73447,Different than what you usually see around.,73447,4
73447,"I would have liked to give it a five star review, but the tulle was cut uneven at the bottom.",73447,4
73447,I had to use my scissors and fix it.,73447,4
73448,"socks are fine, my personal preference is for longer socks (e.g.",73448,4
73448,But the socks are adequate given the cost,73448,4
73449,I can normally wear a boys XL but this was a bit smaller than most.,73449,4
73449,I just needed it for a costume so I cut the sleeves off and wore it as a vest.,73449,4
73449,Might fit an actual child just fine.,73449,4
73451,But shrinks like crazy when its washed.,73451,4
73451,So I recommend not using the dryer,73451,4
73452,"Good Deal - The price is pretty incredible, the material is harder that one would like.",73452,4
73452,"It is beautiful, I didn't use mine because it took away from the detail of my dress.",73452,4
73452,If you have a plain skirt then you can use this vail.,73452,4
73452,Arrived quickly would recommend.,73452,4
73454,I've had these before.,73454,4
73454,Bought them from a sporting shoe store.,73454,4
73454,This was good buy.,73454,4
73455,"Love the material, I'm a very petite woman and I can wear this shirt no problem, under the arms is a little larger than I'd hoped but not so big that I can't wear it.",73455,4
73455,I love the print in this shirt it's so adorable!,73455,4
73456,Some of the wires are sticking out after me wearing it daily.,73456,4
73456,I just recently sewed them back in place.,73456,4
73456,Don't go by size of your shirts.,73456,4
73456,I had read the reviews which said they run small.,73456,4
73456,I wear a large shirt and ordered a 2x size and thought it was perfect fit.,73456,4
73456,I would like to order next in white if they have different colors.,73456,4
73456,I'm chubby around the middle and love how it smooths and holds my tummy and love handles in.,73456,4
73457,This purse overall is amazing!,73457,4
73457,"It's so flexible and I'm able to put so much stuff in it, without worrying that it will overfill.",73457,4
73457,The messenger strap makes it easier to carry.,73457,4
73457,"There are just a couple of cons, though.",73457,4
73457,The smell when you first get the bag is a bit overwhelming.,73457,4
73457,It does in fact smell like tuna.,73457,4
73457,"However, I simply ordered a Scentsy scentpak and tossed it in, and the smell was gone quickly.",73457,4
73457,"Also, the purse itself is kind of heavy, even without anything in it.",73457,4
73457,"This isn't really a problem, unless you're going to be shopping for a long period of time or another situation where you have to carry your purse, but other than that it hasn't caused me any issues.",73457,4
73459,"It was a tiny bit tight the first time I put it on, but I think that the stitching just needed a little stretch where the top and skirt connected.",73459,4
73459,"Overall, it worked out well for what I was using it for, and I'm very happy that I bought it!",73459,4
73460,Love these fit great!,73460,4
73461,It's great but wished it was longer,73461,4
73462,"The shirt is slightly stretchy, but was a slight bit tighter than I thought (since the picture made it look loose on her) If you want it to look loose like the picture, order a size bigger, or else it will be a fitted tee.",73462,4
73462,"Super cute though, not disappointed at all, but 4 stars for misleading sizes.",73462,4
73464,The bags arrived on time and had no damage.,73464,4
73464,They are light as expected.,73464,4
73464,"Not going to use them until August 2017 for a cruise, so I will update my rating after the trip.",73464,4
73464,"I did check the handles etc, since a previous reviewer found one handle broken as they were leaving for the airport.",73464,4
73465,Size was a little small.,73465,4
73465,"It's the same size we buy at local stores, however, it was a little small so we can't dry in the dryer.",73465,4
73466,I love this but I wish it can be adjusted because it was too big.,73466,4
73467,Doesnt look as good as the pic,73467,4
73468,I bought this and really hugs my body.,73468,4
73468,"It feels nice, and I feel confident in it!",73468,4
73468,The only thing is the top cup part of the dress seemed too big.,73468,4
73469,"A little bit large, but really beautiful and fresh for hot whetter.",73469,4
73470,LOVE the quality of this bikini.,73470,4
73470,It looks sooooo nice.,73470,4
73470,"I will be honest and say that reading through all of the reviews for sizes may not help, because at the end of the day this is going to fit different for everyone.",73470,4
73470,I am a D cup and ordered a large.,73470,4
73470,"I am very pleased with how the top fits, especially for my boob size lol.",73470,4
73470,"I did have to adjust the straps for more of a lift, because it is not much of a push up.",73470,4
73470,The bottoms are slightly loose but that is just something I noticed.,73470,4
73470,"Keep in mind, if the top fits well for you and the bottoms are loose (or vice versa), just buy some bottoms/tops from Target, Walmart, etc.",73470,4
73470,"I definitely plan on wearing the top with all black, teal or navy blue bottoms just to have some variety.",73470,4
73470,"Overall, the bikini is SO cute and is worth much more than it is being sold for.",73470,4
73470,Getting it from here is such a steal!,73470,4
73471,"The description for this item states that it is a ""tiny"" butterfly necklace with an 18 inch chain.",73471,4
73471,"I received this item in the mail, and when the description says tiny, it is accurate.",73471,4
73471,"The butterfly itself is is only 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch, and will fit inside a dime.",73471,4
73471,"The necklace measures just under 8 inches when held by the clasp, so the total length isn't 18 inches, it's just under 16 inches.",73471,4
73471,I've added a picture to show the size of the butterfly in comparison to a dime.,73471,4
73471,"Luckily, I was purchasing this for my 7 year old daughter, who absolutely adores it.",73471,4
73471,"It is small and feminine, not too shiny and so far it's been durable enough for a 7 year old to wear it without breaking.",73471,4
73471,"The clasp is easy to open and close and the butterfly doesn't ""flip over"" during wear.",73471,4
73471,"The necklace is the perfect gift for a young lady, but seems a bit small to me, for a full grown woman.",73471,4
73471,Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,73471,4
73471,"I have provided my review and the star rating based on my personal experience, which is not affected by the cost of the item.",73471,4
73471,"I have no affiliation with the company or its employees and always welcome feedback, positive and negative and questions.",73471,4
73472,A little smaller than I expected but cute nevertheless.,73472,4
73474,The overall look was great but I'm 5'9 normally a 16 dress size and the sleeves were a bit short.,73474,4
73477,Just what I need to keep my glasses safe and clean.,73477,4
73478,"It was a little big, but I love the design.",73478,4
73479,"They ran too small for my daughter, so we gifted them to her best friend and she loves them, great value but run small.",73479,4
73481,Daughter looked amazing on her special day.,73481,4
73481,Rated a four because he material is somewhat itchy feeling,73481,4
73482,A little thinner material than I had hope for,73482,4
73485,"Soft cloth, style is not like in the picture.",73485,4
73485,"I usually wear M/L, but it turned too tight.",73485,4
73485,"Customer service is great and they sent me a larger size and I get to keep the L (which I cannot wear, but still).",73485,4
73488,Very comfortable shoes that I can wear all day.,73488,4
73489,I really like it and it keeps me warm!,73489,4
73489,The only thing I didn't realize is that it has like a collar.,73489,4
73490,"as described, very nice looking, runs a little on the small side, however not a problem for me",73490,4
73491,"Just a little big and didn't stay in , had to squeeze it together to fit in my voice and stay for the day",73491,4
73492,I can't wait to wear it for my yoga class on Halloween.,73492,4
73493,"A bit short, not tight.",73493,4
73493,I'm only 5'5 and the XL is just at my waist.,73493,4
73495,"Looks nice, but it is a little challenging to remove.",73495,4
73496,"A little snug, medium weight.",73496,4
73496,I'm using them as a work sock with work boots and they are great for that.,73496,4
73496,Remember you aren't paying smartwool sock prices and you can tell.,73496,4
73496,if you want a super comfortable sock spend the money on the smartwool.,73496,4
73496,"If you don't care and these fit your budget, like me, these work fine.",73496,4
73498,Great for yard work.,73498,4
73498,Wish it came in a medium size..,73498,4
73498,It was a bit large.,73498,4
73498,I wear a headband to keep it from hanging on my ears..,73498,4
73499,"Looks great, fits great.",73499,4
73499,"Wish that it didn't collect as much lint in the wash, though.",73499,4
73500,"I do love these shirts, I've bought them in 2 different sizes.",73500,4
73500,"However the second time I bought them, they sent the wrong print.",73500,4
73500,I had picked the starfish one and they sent the elephant one.,73500,4
73500,Not as nice looking in my opinion.,73500,4
73502,"The post that goes through my nose was way too small for a ""new"" piercing.",73502,4
73502,I got my septum pierced 5 weeks ago.,73502,4
73502,"I guess my ""sweet spot"" is thicker than others, because I could barely get this closed and it would pinch.",73502,4
73502,wasn't comfortable because of that.,73502,4
73502,"pretty long too, would constantly touch my top lip.",73502,4
73502,"lol  beautiful colors, feels quality.",73502,4
73503,"the dress is beautiful, and the waist size is good; however, the bust size is really tight.",73503,4
73504,Don't expect it to cover all the bumps on jean buttons.,73504,4
73504,Think of it as a glorified tank top that hugs your pants.,73504,4
73504,I typically wear a size 26 in jeans and the SM could be a lot tigher to actually stay in place.,73504,4
73504,I'm 26 weeks pregnant and maybe it'll have a better fit in the 3rd tri.,73504,4
73504,I still would recommend it if you want to wear your pre-bump pants.,73504,4
73505,This glove keeps your hands unbeleivably warm and are great for smart phones.,73505,4
73505,I will buy it again but they  need to work on the quality so it can last even longer.,73505,4
73506,"Good fleece mask, fits as expected.",73506,4
73506,I just wish that the strings did not stick out on the sides.,73506,4
73507,I've only deducted a point because it arrived a day late.,73507,4
73507,The gauges are great.,73507,4
73508,"Haven't given these a good test yet, but they are comfortable, don't slip at the heel, and feel like they will serve me well on the boat in cool, wet weather.",73508,4
73508,"They are a bit hard to slip on, however, this is probably why they are snug enough to be comfortable while walking.",73508,4
73508,Quality of rubber and elastic seems good.,73508,4
73509,It's the exact as in the pic good quality product,73509,4
73510,"great hats, get a lot of complements",73510,4
73511,"The size chart is confusing, so I went with a size up...it's really cute in person, which I would've gotten the smaller size for a better fit.",73511,4
73512,Its really cute and good quality for the price!,73512,4
73514,I love the tail.,73514,4
73514,It is made of a legging material and has Velcro on the fins so you can easily open and close them.,73514,4
73514,I'm a size 6 and was able to fit into the medium.,73514,4
73514,It is a little tighter than I would like but it is worth it for the price.,73514,4
73515,"very stretchy, not much support for working out but its ok for lounging.... and lovely print, I got alot of compliments on the colors.",73515,4
73517,like the style and colcors,73517,4
73518,Enjoy this ring .,73518,4
73519,I had a baby 5 months ago.,73519,4
73519,So mid section is not bikini ready.,73519,4
73519,I'm 5'2 and about 125lbs.,73519,4
73519,34c and I got the M. Happy with the fit.,73519,4
73519,I've bought a few suits that just suck for my body.,73519,4
73519,This one is good,73519,4
73520,"In terms of how this product looks and fits, it's pretty much exactly what I wanted.",73520,4
73520,However I can't give it 5 stars because it arrived with some small holes in it.,73520,4
73520,"Luckily they were on the seam so it was VERY easy to repair, and I have no idea if this is a common problem or not.",73520,4
73520,Once the repair was done I was very happy with it.,73520,4
73521,A little bit too large.,73521,4
73523,Th blouse was too small for me but it fit my sister perfectly.,73523,4
73523,I ordered a 5x and she wears a size 12.,73523,4
73524,Order one size up as directed.,73524,4
73524,"I'm slim and fit with a 29"" waist, small but round butt and very full endowment.",73524,4
73524,Normally a size S ( which fits waist but is snug on package) ordered a medium and it fits waist and butt nicely and really hugs and lifts my bulge.,73524,4
73524,Comfortable all day and either in the locker room at the gym or underwear night at the club I get lots of attention and turn every head in these.,73524,4
73524,In other good news the mesh is small enough not to tug on my piercing.,73524,4
73524,"Heads up though for daily wear- if you're a guy who pre-c's a lot, you will spot your jeans/pants.",73524,4
73525,I bought these for my grandson.,73525,4
73525,He normally wears a size 3 so I bought a size 4 to wear longer.,73525,4
73525,The size 4 fit like his other size 3 shirts.,73525,4
73525,Other than that they are great.,73525,4
73526,Nice quality and fit based on my waist measurement.,73526,4
73526,I like it a lot!,73526,4
73527,"Loved the quality and fabric, but a little too small",73527,4
73528,Nice product for the price.,73528,4
73529,Will wear with jeans just like the picture.,73529,4
73532,"I couldn't zip this past my first rib but my niece who is 5'2"" and a size 0 looks fantastic in it.",73532,4
73532,It was well made just much shorter and smaller than expected.,73532,4
73533,Really gives my pebble time a more classy look.,73533,4
73533,I've had it for a month and it has a few light scratches on the clasp that rests on the bottom of my wrist and hits every surface I put my arm on.,73533,4
73533,Only reason I knocked a star is because to change the size of the band you have to use a small screwdriver or the tool included.,73533,4
73533,If you are out somewhere and need to change the size for whatever reason you are out of luck.,73533,4
73533,That and it is prone to scratches but it was very affordable.,73533,4
73533,I'd like to try the magnetic one,73533,4
73534,Pleasantly surprised for the most part.,73534,4
73534,"I wasn't thrilled with the color choices, I wanted blue or brown or even tan, none of which appeared to be a choice.",73534,4
73534,"I don't remember the name of the color I decided to go with, but it looked rather green.",73534,4
73534,To my surprise it was actually a very nice shade of blue!,73534,4
73534,"It is not as fitted as in the photos, which is probably a good thing.",73534,4
73534,"I'm 5', 105 lbs, the size Small fit me very well, not unflatteringly tight or baggy.",73534,4
73534,The length comes just below my cheeks.,73534,4
73534,I like almost everything about it except...it's not quite heavy enough.,73534,4
73534,It's looks like a hoodie sweatshirt and I wish it was as then it would be warmer.,73534,4
73534,I guess I might describe it as a thick t-shirt material.,73534,4
73534,"It's far from see-through, but it ""aint"" no sweatshirt.",73534,4
73535,"Very soft tie, easy to tie.",73535,4
73536,"Adorable top, the tank started coming unsewn on the edge, but easily fixable.",73536,4
73536,Looks great with a long necklace to dress it up a little,73536,4
73537,This is a great dress and looks good on.,73537,4
73537,"Normally, I wear a medium or large, and based on the reviews so far, I bought a small--I'm glad I did.",73537,4
73537,"It's roomy by nature, but a bigger size would have been too roomy.",73537,4
73537,I am excited to wear it to Vegas!,73537,4
73538,I got this dress in size 0 in the color regency.,73538,4
73538,The company was really good and stayed in contact with me through the whole process.,73538,4
73538,"The dress in pictures looks like the bottom was tight and then flared but it is a loose fitting really comfortable dress, the only uncomfortable part was the collar it was pretty tight and itchy but wasn't really a big deal.",73538,4
73538,"The beading Is really delicate and nice and comes with several extra beads just in case, in which they do come loose easily.",73538,4
73538,I was skeptical about ordering the dress but it was totally worth it and they customized it to my size requirements with no extra cost.,73538,4
73538,Overall it's a great dress and I would highly recommend it,73538,4
73540,Very tinted and very mirrored.,73540,4
73540,Only problem I have is that my first pair dropped maybe 3-4 times at most and the lense popped out.,73540,4
73540,Impossible to put back in.,73540,4
73540,At least I have a pack of 3.,73540,4
73541,The costume is truly adorable and sexy!,73541,4
73541,The only thing I would caution to potential buyers is that the skirt runs pretty small.,73541,4
73541,I wear about a US size 6/8 in jeans and the skirt can only barely fasten on my hips.,73541,4
73541,"The fabric feels cheap, but honestly thats a very minor complaint.",73541,4
73541,Definitely recommend for smaller buyers.,73541,4
73542,"unfortunately,
I had to return it.",73542,4
73542,"It was too big, but I loved this dress!",73542,4
73542,"It was a major hassle because it wasn't ""PRIME""
Order up!",73542,4
73542,smaller size would fit better.,73542,4
73542,I order a large.,73542,4
73542,The Medium would have worked!!,73542,4
73544,Fell out of my ears and shattered a week after having them.,73544,4
73544,VERY heavy plugs so be careful.,73544,4
73545,Very nice but it's heavyweight.,73545,4
73546,"Runs small, material somewhat sheer, buy larger size and it is cute for the price,",73546,4
73547,After some initial confusion based on my shipping address (I live in Taiwan) I got the watch much earlier than expected.,73547,4
73547,"It looks nice and feels solid, and I would say that it was worth the price.",73547,4
73548,"I was hesitant to purchase this due to the mixed reviews but if the strings are tied correctly and it's not on backwards (which is the only reason I can suppose someone's nipples would peak out), it's an adorable summer dress.",73548,4
73549,Great shirt to pair with leggings and maybe a sweater during the winter!!!,73549,4
73551,Apparently the lady in the picture would be sexy in a potato sack.,73551,4
73551,It wasn't flattering at all but it's comfortable so it was nice.,73551,4
73552,"Outfit was great otherwise,except for the top.",73552,4
73552,I had to make adjustments to the bra part.,73552,4
73552,I had to see in inserts.,73552,4
73552,"I loved the bottom, fit well.",73552,4
73553,If there was a XS available I would have gotten it but it should work okay with a belt!,73553,4
73554,"I'm 5'2"" and the length is great on me so I suspect it runs a bit short on normal sized people.",73554,4
73554,Very comfortable but not quite as feminine styled as Nautica's split neck polos in my opinion.,73554,4
73554,I machine wash and air dry so I don't know if it will shrink in the wash.,73554,4
73554,This is a very nice color and the picture is accurate.,73554,4
73555,I LIKE IT BUT LITTLE TOO BIG,73555,4
73556,This is a nice top that fits well.,73556,4
73557,"Super cute, but the fit is strange.",73557,4
73557,"The legs on the 12-18 month size are REALLY long, but the body is fine.",73557,4
73557,Hoping the legs shrink in the dryer and the body doesn't.,73557,4
73557,It would be ok if there were something to hold them to her feet.,73557,4
73557,"She is just now walking, so appreciate the rubber soles; however, the legs are so long, the soles end up off her feet and she slips and falls.",73557,4
73558,This is a beautiful suit!,73558,4
73558,I wear a medium in us sizes so I bought an XL.,73558,4
73558,"It's a bit tight, but I've recently gained a little weight so I'm attributing it to that.",73558,4
73558,Plus it'll expand in water.,73558,4
73558,It looks exactly like the picture and does not seem cheaply made!,73558,4
73559,This skirt is as described.,73559,4
73559,I ordered the army green color and it does have a short lining.,73559,4
73559,The quality is great and heavier than I expected.,73559,4
73559,I always read every review and then base my decision on that.,73559,4
73559,I was concerned about the size but if you use the size guide provided it's pretty accurate.,73559,4
73559,"I am 5'3"" and it's long even with heels.",73559,4
73559,I'll need to hem it.,73559,4
73559,I also ordered a size medium which fits perfectly.,73559,4
73559,My waist is approx.,73559,4
73559,"29"" and I usually wear a size small or xsmall so be sure to measure your waist.",73559,4
73560,"Just as an FYI, the color is more vivid than shown.",73560,4
73561,soft and cute design,73561,4
73562,The color appeared peach in the photo and was more day-glo orange.,73562,4
73562,Fortunately the baby mama liked it.,73562,4
73564,Very pretty earrings with a classy look.,73564,4
73564,I wish they were a bit smaller but they aren't so huge that they look gawdy.,73564,4
73564,I would've rated five stars if they weren't as big.,73564,4
73564,But they are made well and are still pretty.,73564,4
73565,I purchased one like this previously with a chevron design.,73565,4
73565,I liked it and I also like this one!,73565,4
73565,These can also be paired with a large belt for a slightly different look!,73565,4
73565,I ordered size large.,73565,4
73565,I am regularly a size 11/12 5'3 175lbs.,73565,4
73566,"Nice affordable belt,takes a little to get use to.",73566,4
73567,Cute but I ordered up based on reviews and shouldn't have done that.,73567,4
73567,"I'm 5'1"", 115-120 lbs and originally ordered the large which was huge.",73567,4
73567,"I then sized down to the medium and while the waist and hips fit, the leg holes and bottom part of the butt was big and the shorts were longer than I like (I was expecting Daisy Dukes, which these are not on me).",73567,4
73567,The edges are also much more uneven than I was expecting.,73567,4
73567,"However, I do have to say that this company by far has the best customer service I've ever experienced and overall the shorts are really cute.",73567,4
73567,"The material is also super soft, which is unusual for denim shorts.",73567,4
73570,Good for what I bought it for - to wear under sleeveless dresses because we aren't allowed to wear them to work.,73570,4
73570,"It was a little small, but no one will be able to tell with something over it.",73570,4
73570,It's also partially lined making it nicer than many of these lacy shirts.,73570,4
73572,I really like the top and wear the top all the time.,73572,4
73572,"The bottoms are tiny however, very cheeky.",73572,4
73573,great value for the quality,73573,4
73574,"I tad bit smaller than I thought they would be, but good material and construction.",73574,4
73575,Love how it holds my brushes but the bag is smaller then I thought it would be.,73575,4
73575,It was delivered earlier then expected which was a great surprise.,73575,4
73576,This shirt is very long on me it's not really what I expected but I will keep it to wear around the house.,73576,4
73577,"Vest fit and arrived as expected, but only the vest arrived.",73577,4
73577,Will be contacting the vendor for an update.,73577,4
73577,"Wore it last night for a fund raising event, just changed my shirt to a banded collar.",73577,4
73579,You get what you see .I like them for me,73579,4
73580,Feels great just a little big.,73580,4
73580,I love it and it feels really nice.,73580,4
73581,"I like how cutely casual this is, and it looks great with Bermuda shorts in the summer.",73581,4
73581,"The one thing that surprised me, is that the neckline is a tad lower than it appears on the mannequin.",73581,4
73581,"Normally that would be less of a problem, but you aren't meant to wear a bra with this, so it can be difficult to stay covered if you have a larger chest.",73581,4
73582,"It's a very nice bag and the fabric print is extremely cute; however, it's much smaller than I was anticipating.",73582,4
73582,"I was hoping to have a new over-night bag for trips, but it's more of a beach towel bag.",73582,4
73582,Of course that's my own fault for not reading the measurements more carefully.,73582,4
73583,looks exactly like pic runs a little small but still looks great.,73583,4
73583,the hanging pieces do come off after only 2 wears.,73583,4
73583,i bought a small and fits perfectly,73583,4
73584,However they are a bit small for the cup size but still worked perfect.,73584,4
73584,I was able to put them on and take them off without any difficulty.,73584,4
73585,"Just bought these for my baby's daycare, who asks for navy pants as part of the uniform.",73585,4
73585,"These are pretty cute, but the fitting is somewhat small.",73585,4
73585,I recommend buying a larger size if you do not want them too tight.,73585,4
73585,"A larger size allows them to be worn as pants, not as tight as leggings would be, making them more comfortable for your baby.",73585,4
73586,Takes some time to get to you you but worth the wait.,73586,4
73586,Would buy more if I was getting a discount as many do for writing a review.,73586,4
73586,Paid full price on the many I have been buying.,73586,4
73586,Must not like my business or would offer discounts:),73586,4
73587,Fit to tight and made from average material kinda looks like a cheap nurse Halloween costume,73587,4
73588,"I normally buy a large so that the item is roomy, but when I read the reviews, I ordered a medium and am very happy with it.",73588,4
73589,Works fine hat now fits.,73589,4
73590,My wife loved it.,73590,4
73590,The material is awesome.,73590,4
73590,She looks great in it.,73590,4
73591,Picked by my soon to be daughter-in-law.,73591,4
73591,"But the pants show cellulite and bumps, i will just need to get some shapewear for underneath.",73591,4
73592,"I do like the bathing suit, but the top where it covers the girls is VERY small.",73592,4
73592,"Even with a size up, it probably wouldn't make a difference.",73592,4
73592,The bathing suit is on the sexier side even though it appears to cover more than a regular two piece bathing suit.,73592,4
73594,"Nice shades; good quality frames, adequate tint, stylish.",73594,4
73594,Hard case would have been a benefit though.,73594,4
73595,"I'm pleasantly surprised, this dress fits me better than I thought  probably because the material doesn't cling and although it's somewhat former fitting, it's like enough to hide all the extra pounds if you have some, I simply love this dress, I plan to order another!",73595,4
73595,I hope they don't run out of stock b4 I can!,73595,4
73596,Waiting for my kiddo to fit into these shoes.,73596,4
73597,Very nice ring; a little bluer in person.,73597,4
73598,"Looks really cute on, however the top is tight in my shoulders.",73598,4
73598,Love the skirt and tie though.,73598,4
73599,Love the tote & great value!,73599,4
73599,Roomy & fashionable for office.,73599,4
73599,Looking forward to using it on vacation too.,73599,4
73600,"Thought I'd ordered a small (receipt said medium) and was 2 seconds from returning it, BUT it fits perfectly.",73600,4
73600,"I got a medium, and I'm 4'11"", ~130lbs.",73600,4
73601,Great plugs for the price,73601,4
73603,It is pretty nice.,73603,4
73604,The material is strange & it's one of those shirts that's tighter around the bottom than the top (or maybe I'm oddly shaped?),73604,4
73604,"I got a small & am very small chested & small in the hips, too.",73604,4
73604,It will kind of ride up a bit but I attribute that to the material.,73604,4
73604,"Overall, it's really great.",73604,4
73605,Dress is too big we are going to try and get it altered.,73605,4
73605,We love the dress just too big.,73605,4
73606,I  bought a bigger size and it perfect,73606,4
73607,Very pretty but I am returning it because it is too small.,73607,4
73607,"I am 5' 5""; weigh 170 and I bought a Large.",73607,4
73607,I usually wear a size 12-14.,73607,4
73607,I may try ordering a larger size.,73607,4
73608,good quality material but longer then I thought and I'm a 36 inch waist,73608,4
73609,"Fits well, nice and soft, don't care for how the collar lays/lies?",73609,4
73609,Lighter fabric than I anticipated.,73609,4
73611,I wished I had bought the next size up.,73611,4
73612,Nice and dark shades.,73612,4
73612,Possible quality issue... there is a small screw that holds logo to arm of shades.,73612,4
73612,"Mine arrived with one of the screws missing, which creates a rattle sound.",73612,4
73612,"I could easily return for exchange but the quality, look, feel and price make that small flaw tolerable.",73612,4
73613,My son loves them.,73613,4
73613,They are his basketball shoes!,73613,4
73617,thicker than I was looking for but still a good product.,73617,4
73618,This is a pretty nice fitted dress shirt for the money.,73618,4
73618,"Remember to heed the instructions- this is Chinese sizing (their words, not mine)- order at least 2 full sizes up.",73618,4
73618,"I ordered a 2x for my 15 year old, 5;10', 165lb.",73618,4
73618,son and it worked well.,73618,4
73620,Very unique and perfect for a tea party I was invited to.,73620,4
73621,a bit larger than I thought they'd be but did the magic I needed,73621,4
73622,Very flattering for plus size girls!,73622,4
73622,This would look beautiful on all body types.,73622,4
73622,"Although I normally wear an XXL in lingerie (mostly due to my large bust, 40DD) I ordered the XXXL because I know sometimes lingerie that comes from overseas (Asian sizes) tends to run small.",73622,4
73622,The product description said this should fit US size 20-22 but I wear size 16 and I had to squeeze into it.,73622,4
73622,"Aside from the fact that it runs small, it is a really beautiful piece of lingerie.",73622,4
73622,It probably would have fit perfectly if there were elastic at the bust line because a little stretch is really all it needs.,73622,4
73622,"The material itself is silky and very lightweight, and I didn't experience any itchiness or irritation with the lace trim.",73622,4
73622,That's usually a big thing for me so I'm happy with the quality of the material used on this camisole.,73622,4
73622,"The g-string that was included with this piece was actually a tad bit over sized, but it still fit well enough that I could wear it.",73622,4
73622,"Usually it's the opposite, those typically tend to run really small.",73622,4
73622,"(It may look a little purplish-blue in my photos, but in person, it really is true to the color shown in the stock photo.",73622,4
73622,My bedroom just has really bad lighting and the flash from the camera didn't help.),73622,4
73622,Free sample provided for my evaluation.,73622,4
73623,"Size 18 (American)
I love this dress!",73623,4
73623,I bought it as a lounging around dress & it is perfect for that.,73623,4
73623,As a fat lady I have trouble finding loose dresses that fit me and aren't muumuus but this is perfect!,73623,4
73623,"It is very flowing, very comfy in both cold and warm places.",73623,4
73623,AND IT HAS POCKETS!!!,73623,4
73623,I feel like a wizard whenever I put it on.,73623,4
73623,"The red that I got has a bit of an orange cast to it, but the color is quite vivid.",73623,4
73623,"4 stars instead of 5 because the dress had lots of loose thread at the end of the hems and coming out of a few buttons, but they were easily snipped off with no damage to the dress.",73623,4
73624,There exactly what my get up and go little boy needs!,73624,4
73625,This dress does run large so I listened to other reviewers and bought a size smaller (I usually buy a large - I normally wear a size 12 - but on this dress I bought a medium) & it fits well.,73625,4
73625,My only complaint is that the fabric is just okay.,73625,4
73625,In a dress like this I would have preferred a softer material but this is just a little stiff & thin.,73625,4
73625,"I wish they would do a T-shirt material, that would be 5 star worthy!",73625,4
73625,"That being said, it has 2 nice deep pockets & it is machine wash & dry.",73625,4
73626,"A bit of an off experience with this top, but mostly I like the shirt.",73626,4
73626,"Upon arrival, it was wrapping in a sealed plastic bag, as normal.",73626,4
73626,"But upon opening it, it smelled very heavily of women's perfume- a coconut flavored smell.",73626,4
73626,And it had a blond curly hair attached to it (mine's brown and straight).,73626,4
73626,It seemed that someone else took it for quite the test drive before I received it.,73626,4
73626,"Even after washing and drying the garment, it still smells quite strongly of perfume.",73626,4
73626,"As for the fit, I'm undecided if I'm going to be able to use it or not.",73626,4
73626,"It may be a little too top heavy for me, since I have a large bust and athletic shoulders.",73626,4
73626,"The ruching across the collarbone draws the eyes wide, so it can look more masculine if you don't have narrow shoulders.",73626,4
73626,The top is tight at the waist and looser at the shoulders and chest by design.,73626,4
73626,"My measurements are 5'4"", 115lbs, 32DD.",73626,4
73626,"It fits well, but I may be taking it in a bit with my sewing machine to get it to fit better.",73626,4
73626,"Otherwise, it is a good quality fabric.",73626,4
73626,"It's thick enough to not be see-through at all, and I think it's a good price for the top.",73626,4
73626,"The sizing was correct for me, I ordered the XS in charcoal.",73626,4
73626,It says to hand wash and then hang dry.,73626,4
73626,"I prefer lower maintenance items, and should have checked this first so be sure to take that into account.",73626,4
73626,"However, the tag says to machine wash and dry, which is what I did and it turned out just fine.",73626,4
73626,There's nothing about this fabric that made me think it shouldn't be washed and dried.,73626,4
73627,A little blingy but my contest winners love them.,73627,4
73628,"All the reviews about the ""bad smell"" are CORRECT!",73628,4
73628,"I sprayed mine with febreze, and put two dryer sheets in dryer on low....took away most of smell......before that, I put it outside overnight, but since that didn't work, I used the dryer method.",73628,4
73628,I LOVE the color and style so much....I am keeping the bag.,73628,4
73628,"the odor is so minimal now, it should be totally gone In week or two!",73628,4
73629,"Visually attractive, very easy to read.",73629,4
73629,Band a little tight.,73629,4
73630,I bought this as a gift for my husband.,73630,4
73630,He does a lot of work outside of our house in the yard and with the pool.,73630,4
73630,He kept getting sunburned and I really wanted to make sure he was protecting his skin.,73630,4
73630,It's a little tighter than I thought it would be.....He said he prefers adjustable hats more than one size fits all.,73630,4
73630,Other than that it's been working out really well!,73630,4
73632,Love the color and the look.,73632,4
73632,It's a bit too big for me which is surprising.,73632,4
73632,Was hoping to wear it for vacation but will return it instead.,73632,4
73634,"was a little to small, so returned.",73634,4
73634,Was nice shirt though.,73634,4
73635,These compression socks work very well for me.,73635,4
73635,I have been having problems with my achilles and they added extra support.,73635,4
73637,"Very cute, but small in the arms.",73637,4
73637,Ordered a medium for my average sized 11 yr old thinking it would fit her for a couple years.,73637,4
73637,She complains of the arms being tight.,73637,4
73637,Order at least a size up for sure.,73637,4
73638,Purchased as a gift and it was well received by a fencing fan.,73638,4
73639,"I bought it for a Halloween costume, way too tacky for me to wear more often than once a year for the fourth of July from now on.",73639,4
73639,"Quality shirt, seems like it will hold up fairly well.",73639,4
73640,"I love them, so very soft.",73640,4
73640,"I wanted a small but they were out, these fit well, more room ( I like them very snug) LOVE the vibrant color and my boyfriend complimented me on them too, so that makes them even better!",73640,4
73640,"=) I didn't give them a 5 star because I feel they should be a little further up on the calf, i just push them up a little bit and feel that they may pill a little bit after washing( WASH them INSIDE OUT) This is my 4th pair (different colors) so a repeat buyer for sure =)",73640,4
73641,Very nice...I wish I would have got a smaller size...but it looks good on me...can't wait to wear it,73641,4
73642,Not too heavy for a summer baptism.,73642,4
73643,"Just doesn't fit as a dress more like a shirt, but I'm also 5'8",73643,4
73644,"The shirt is VERY vibrant, and I love that.",73644,4
73644,"I'm giving 4 stars because it lays a little weird on my body and the face is hard to make out, but that might just be my body type.",73644,4
73644,"Also, the material is very very synthetic feeling in that fake stretchy fabric feel.",73644,4
73644,But I really like the design and can't wait to wear it.,73644,4
73644,"It does fit somewhat snug, especially around the hips so it rides up some.",73644,4
73645,"Well, it's REALLY ORANGE, more than coral colored and fits tight, even though I bought bigger than what I thought I needed.",73645,4
73645,"Appears to be well made, maybe it would be good to put the ""inches around the bottom"" in the description to help those of us who are chubby to buy the right one.",73645,4
73646,I absolutely LOVED this dress.,73646,4
73646,"It fit nicely, it hugged all the right places.",73646,4
73646,The white was a little bit see through.,73646,4
73646,"but all in all, it was my favorite....

Until I washed it.......",73646,4
73646,"It shrunk, it got shorter, and now I can no longer wear it.",73646,4
73646,My suggestion----hand wash only!,73646,4
73647,"Holds important id's and cards with no worry of the usual
  bend that occurs in leather wallet",73647,4
73648,Thought it was matte black from the picture though.,73648,4
73649,Bought these for my sister for her birthday!,73649,4
73649,Love that this came with 3 pieces of jewelry for the price.,73649,4
73649,She says the snitch necklace is her favorite.,73649,4
73649,My favorite is the time turner.,73649,4
73649,"Was also very impressed with the quality, she wears everyday and chains are still holding strong.",73649,4
73649,Sometimes I purchase discounted items for review but I did purchase this item at full price and an very satisfied with my purchase.,73649,4
73650,very pretty but super long for my 5'1 frame.,73650,4
73650,Heels couldn't even help.,73650,4
73650,I wish that it fit better because it is really pretty,73650,4
73651,Love the shirt but a bit small for the size described.,73651,4
73652,Giving it 4/5 stars because the design and quality is great.,73652,4
73652,"However, I did have to return it because the size was larger than what I expected from the sizing chart.",73652,4
73652,"For my daughter, the top was too long and the bottoms a bit too short.",73652,4
73652,"We could have lived with the bottoms being short, by the top was way long.",73652,4
73652,"Otherwise, it's a great karate uniform.",73652,4
73652,"Feels like the heavier material but lighter, and plent strong for body throws.",73652,4
73652,I am sad it did not work for her.,73652,4
73653,I ordered a small based on the size chart and they are pretty big.,73653,4
73653,Thankfully with the drawstring they will be ok.,73653,4
73653,The print is cute and the elastic in the top makes nursing a breeze.,73653,4
73656,Wish it's a bit bigger so my kids can use it for more than a year (2 summer seasons).,73656,4
73657,I like this shirt it does for abit large.,73657,4
73657,I ordered a medium and fits like a large.,73657,4
73657,I should have ordered a small.,73657,4
73657,I normally wear medium.,73657,4
73657,It is great though overall.,73657,4
73658,I got lots of compliments and it was easy to clean.,73658,4
73658,I just wish it had a skeleton printed on the back too.,73658,4
73659,"Quality seems pretty good, definitely soft and comfortable, and the colors were very bright and beautiful!",73659,4
73661,I'm only taking off one point because one arrived damaged....but they don't leave marks on my babies head and they are just precious!,73661,4
73662,Bought this before realizing that this watch is similar to the one with the black band.,73662,4
73662,This was advertised as an a one inch dial face.,73662,4
73662,The original I bought was advertised as .8 of an inch.,73662,4
73662,"Now having scrutinized both watches, they seem to have the same size dial face.",73662,4
73662,If I had been aware that the faces were the same measurement I would not have bought one for $64 and one for $24 if they were one and the same.,73662,4
73662,"T he only difference so far are the watchbands: one's blue, one's black.",73662,4
73662,"Did I pay $40 more for the same watch, or did I pay $40 for a blue watchband compared to a black watchband?",73662,4
73662,I wish the seller would answer this question.,73662,4
73662,Bought quite a few earrings from them and was pleased.,73662,4
73662,"However, this issue with the watches irks me.",73662,4
73662,Maybe I was had.,73662,4
73663,"My son was excited when he opened the box and saw these, he wasn't too happy about the fact that I have to return them for a bigger size.",73663,4
73663,"He didn't want to tell me that they did not fit, I noticed how small they looked on him.",73663,4
73663,"I ordered a 30 aka 13 in the US, so I now have to find a seller with these in a US size 1.",73663,4
73663,"Overall they are very cute, affordable and the LED lights worked fine.",73663,4
73664,"Clasp broke, but I repaired.",73664,4
73664,I enjoy wearing it.,73664,4
73666,Being a bigger girl and ordering clothes off the internet is always hard.,73666,4
73666,I always order one or two sizes bigger and always check the size charts.,73666,4
73666,I will say that this dress was very true to the size that I thought it was going to be.,73666,4
73666,"I love the material it is nice and light weight, the only problem I had is that one of the seams was a little ripped but it took me three minutes with a needle and thread to fix it.",73666,4
73666,I did not want to send the garment all the way back so I did just fix it myself.,73666,4
73666,"I really like the sleeves, they are nice and airy and I will be able to wear this dress to work without having to wear a shrug since it is not technically sleeveless.",73666,4
73666,"The length is nice, I am 58 and it is the perfect length I do not have to hem it at all, but I would say that a shorter woman would have to.",73666,4
73666,"I like the way that this dress drapes, it isn't clingy yet shows my curves without being skin tight on my stomach area.",73666,4
73666,I am apple shaped so I have a hard time finding clothes that flatter and I have to say that this dress really does flatter my shape.,73666,4
73666,I have had the privilege of receiving this product at a discount price or for free.,73666,4
73667,cheap and light weight but it works and still looks good.,73667,4
73668,I bought this for my daughter although I was hesitant after reading some of the reviews.,73668,4
73668,It came quickly and is of a decent quality.,73668,4
73668,All of the buttons are securely fastened although they may loosen over time.,73668,4
73668,I went back and forth and ultimately got the medium and it fits her fine.,73668,4
73668,"She's about 5'6"" and 125 with a small frame.",73668,4
73668,The sleeves are a bit long but not enough to be noticeable - at least she doesn't care at all.,73668,4
73669,I didn't expect it to be as nice as it is.,73669,4
73669,I wish it came in more colors,73669,4
73671,I still ache but they are supportive and firm.,73671,4
73672,This is a clever shirt and a great gift for fans of the video game(s) Fall Out.,73672,4
73672,Not a terribly thin fabric for price it fit as usual and didn't shrink after drying on low heat.,73672,4
73672,I always wash such shirts inside out to maintain the illustration and would advise the same here.,73672,4
73673,Fun tank at good price.,73673,4
73674,I traveled around the world for the past 8 months and LOVED carrying this instead of a mini umbrella (every ounce counts for a minimalist light packer like myself).,73674,4
73674,"PROS
- Incredibly lightweight
- Carrying pouch (sometimes I even used the poncho to sit on concrete steps that I thought might stain my clothes, and it was nice to throw this into the pouch instead of folding up those germs inside my purse and then easily being able to wash the whole thing)
- Roomy - I loved that I could put this on over my large purse or backpack and it would keep those things completely dry too, unlike those mini umbrellas
- Reversible

CONS
- They could surely find a way to make the ""sleeves"" and front a little longer so that more of you doesn't get wet
- One of the buttons broke off - they could've been sewed on a little more securely",73674,4
73675,Arrived before expected and fits perfect!!,73675,4
73676,I'd give this belt five stars if it had come with any information about how to unbuckle it.,73676,4
73676,"I had never used a belt like this before, but when it arrived  I had no trouble putting it on.",73676,4
73676,"When I tried to take it off, however, I couldn't figure out how to use the lever underneath the belt buckle to release the catch.",73676,4
73676,I lifted (apparently not far enough).,73676,4
73676,"My wife did the same, without any more success than I had.",73676,4
73676,I finally got so frustrated I headed for the kitchen to get a knife to cut the belt off.,73676,4
73676,"Luckily, on the way, I got so angry I power-jerked the belt off.",73676,4
73676,"When I cooled down, I experimented with it until I found that if I pushed the lever up AS FAR AS I COULD PUSH IT, the catch released and I could back the belt out of the teeth that holds it in place.",73676,4
73676,"West: For those people like me who are all thumbs, please provide a diagram showing (1) how to push the belt through the buckle to cinch it up, and (2) how to release the catch.",73676,4
73676,It doesn't even have to have words--just a simple diagram will do.,73676,4
73676,"Now that I've figured out the system, I'll likely get a brown belt to go with my black one.",73676,4
73676,"I like the all-leather, supple belt that I bought, and I like the buckling system--now that I know how to work it.",73676,4
73676,"By the way, I had to get a belt two sizes larger than my normal belt size because that was the smallest offered.",73676,4
73676,One size larger is more than sufficient.,73676,4
73677,I probably should have gotten the large.,73677,4
73678,This shoe was very narrow.,73678,4
73678,I even go a 1/2 size larger.,73678,4
73681,Big fan of the Volcom brand.,73681,4
73682,It's for little ones with small rumps.,73682,4
73682,They work for one of my sons but the other complains that they're too tight.,73682,4
73682,They have a pleasant cotton feel about them and I like the fact that they are not too long.,73682,4
73682,Compared to the Carter's ones we've been using they are much more snug and the fabric is less thick.,73682,4
73682,I haven't been using them for long so I don't know how they hold up in the wash.,73682,4
73683,It should be good for the purpose that I bought it for.,73683,4
73683,The material feels strong and the best part about it is that I can wear it as a suit or as individual pieces.,73683,4
73684,Love the boots they mold to the foot making the arch for your foot.,73684,4
73684,I would buy these again.,73684,4
73685,Quality of the t shirt.,73685,4
73686,"Yes, meet my wife spectations",73686,4
73687,"This blouse is really pretty, but sadly it did not fit me.",73687,4
73687,I read the reviews and ordered up a size and got a large.,73687,4
73687,I could not even get it over my shoulders!,73687,4
73687,"I wear a size 8 US, so I am pretty surprised the large didn't fit and it's not like I am built like a swimmer!",73687,4
73688,"However, this was intended for my 8 year old daughter but it fits every member of my family, including the adult males.",73688,4
73688,"My daughter did wear it for Halloween, but had to keep it tipped back so she could see.",73688,4
73689,"Thought it was Cotton, my Wife was Slightly disappointed",73689,4
73690,a little big and sizing is weird and hard to understand.,73690,4
73690,Takes a while to ship  - my son hasn't worn it yet but will update when he is able to fit it.,73690,4
73691,"These pants felt really nice, and I like the look of them.",73691,4
73691,Unfortunately they were quite a bit larger than I expected.,73691,4
73691,"I could wear them for comfort I guess, but I'd be constantly pulling them up.",73691,4
73691,"That being said, if I'd known to go down a size, they'd probably be great pants.",73691,4
73692,"Great price,  very dark, run big.",73692,4
73693,Cute hat and arrived in record time.,73693,4
73695,These are nice compression shorts and they are well made and much less expensive than I've found in the sports equipment stores.,73695,4
73695,Shipping took 3-4 weeks (comes from China) and the sizes seem to run small.,73695,4
73695,"I have a 38"" waist and ordered XL and probably should have ordered XXL, (I guess Asian men only ""think"" they are XL, LOL.",73695,4
73695,"So as long as you're not in a hurry and you remember to order a few sizes larger than you think you should, it's a good product.",73695,4
73695,I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.,73695,4
73696,Purchased for my daughter.,73696,4
73696,She really liked them.,73696,4
73696,I thought the color was red but it's actually closer to a dark pink color.,73696,4
73696,The fit is different from other earrings but she really lokes them.,73696,4
73696,I saw Lady GaGa wearing similar ones in pearls.,73696,4
73697,This dress was beautifully made.,73697,4
73697,We were very happy with the dress.,73697,4
73697,"The only thing I have to say is the skirt was a bit heavy but this is only because it was lined, so it was like twice the material on the dress.",73697,4
73697,"The hooks kept opening on the back of the top, so I would recommend checking them and/or making them tighter before going out or being prepared with needle and thread, just in case.",73697,4
73697,Wear it around the house for a bit to make sure nothing opens.,73697,4
73697,It did take about 3 weeks to get this and that was with expedited shipping.,73697,4
73697,Not sure it was expedited and would not pay the extra again for it.,73697,4
73697,Bottom line--Dress is beautiful and very nice quality.,73697,4
73697,Back of the top opens when you wear it.,73697,4
73697,Shipping took very long when I paid for expedited shipping.,73697,4
73697,I would recommend buying this dress.,73697,4
73698,This is such a cute hat!,73698,4
73698,It blocks the sun from my baby's eyes and neck very well.,73698,4
73698,The front goes into his eyes some but not bad I might just have to adjust it a little better it's still new but we have used it a few times.,73698,4
73699,Not a lady's shawl.,73699,4
73699,more like an american girls doll shawl.,73699,4
73700,It's a good product,73700,4
73701,"Cute, simple necklace I can wear with anything!",73701,4
73702,"Although I like the headbands, I was surprised to find that the type of material they were made out of.",73702,4
73702,It almost looked more polyester than cotton.,73702,4
73703,This fits well but the fabric is a little too see through for me to love it.,73703,4
73703,I don't like it when you can see my bra through the fabric.,73703,4
73703,"Nice length, looks great with leggings.",73703,4
73704,"Loved the look and feel, but the size LG was too big for me (I usually wear a 8/10) .. gave it to my daughter, she tried it on, and loved it so much, she wore it for the rest of the day.",73704,4
73704,"I plan to order a size down for myself, but now I need to choose a different color",73704,4
73706,"It fits a little small but once u figure out how to tie it, it fits great!",73706,4
73706,I wouldn't recommend it for vigorous water activities maybe just for relaxing on the beach or on the deck for a cruise.,73706,4
73706,I also tried jumping in itand running around a little to see if my boobs would come out but they didn't but make sure you tie it right enough to keep them in.,73706,4
73706,"I weigh 180 lbs, 36DDD and I'm 5'1.",73706,4
73707,"Very cute, doesn't feel like anything is there which is nice.",73707,4
73707,I wish they used a little bit stronger metal for the connecting parts so the it could be more  reinforced but other than that I love them.,73707,4
73708,"Instead of 8 this ring was 8,5.",73708,4
73708,So i had to pay extra to resize it.,73708,4
73708,Other than that it looks just like on picture.,73708,4
73710,she seems to like it,73710,4
73711,"A little wide for my nose, so I was sore for a few days, but this seems pretty great other than that.",73711,4
73712,I think these are cute.,73712,4
73712,I have a chunky 9 month old and I got 18m (that's what he wears in everything else) and it fits great.,73712,4
73712,Only issue I have is there is no elastic in the footie part so his feet are always sliding up the leg part.,73712,4
73712,But very functional and great price.,73712,4
73713,The dress is very pretty and very flattering but extremely short in the front and super long in the back.,73713,4
73713,It fit like a shirt in the front and I ordered a Large.,73713,4
73713,The bottom of the slit came down a little bit past my crotch and the mesh came about a half an inch after.,73713,4
73713,Still showed my underwear.,73713,4
73713,Will be returning it.,73713,4
73713,I suggest you buy a size or two bigger then you wear.,73713,4
73715,Nicely made hat and has a larger brim for sun protection especially when our daughter is out swimming.,73715,4
73715,Love the iplay brand,73715,4
73716,I ordered the Starry Night print skirt and it came just as expected.,73716,4
73716,The colors and design was just like the picture and I recieved many compliments on it.,73716,4
73716,The only tiny problem I have against it is that it is so stretchy that it sometimes rotates around my waist and completely turns around as I go about my day.,73716,4
73716,But hey for $10 it's a great skirt and it stays on my waist!,73716,4
73717,They last a long time and look realistic.,73717,4
73718,One feels larger than the other.,73718,4
73718,I still wear them all the time and get good compliments.,73718,4
73719,Just seemed to run small to us...quality and side snaps are very convenient.,73719,4
73720,If you need something in a hurry and be decent at the same time this may be a good option.,73720,4
73720,I found the fit to be good even with a a fairly heavy athletic build and the quality better than I had expected.,73720,4
73720,It came in a nice zip up enclosure too.,73720,4
73720,The face piece was probably the weak link.,73720,4
73720,With a little adjustment it can be made to fit better but its cut so generic that it didn't fit well out of the box.,73720,4
73720,For a comfortable but not fancy costume this would be a good choice.,73720,4
73721,"The glow in the dark letters don't really glow in the dark, but my father loves his shirt and wears it on his lazy days",73721,4
73722,ordered the size my husband wears.. these shirts are larger than he normally wears with he REALLY LIKES them,73722,4
73723,The non-skid bumps on the bottom of the sock or a little uncomfortable,73723,4
73724,I bought these for my wife And some others as well.,73724,4
73724,"These look better in the picture then they do in real life, but I can't complain, they still look nice on my wife.",73724,4
73724,For the money you can't go wrong.,73724,4
73724,They fit her well and she is a size 7.,73724,4
73724,These are a little cheaper and have to be tied at back of heal.,73724,4
73724,No metal clasps or anything like some like products.,73724,4
73725,European size 38 is not 8 because they're actually a tad smaller .,73725,4
73725,I loved the arch support and cushion but I have a big toe and it was rubbing on the shoes which do not have a lot of give because of the jelly that wrapped around it.,73725,4
73725,"Also, it had a slight give so my feet would go up and down and rub against the back which will hurt given enough walking minutes.",73725,4
73725,"I think if the mold/structure fit, this would have been perfect...but not on me :(
Loved the arch support.",73725,4
73725,Loved the color and style.,73725,4
73726,"This necklace I bought for a simple, elegant, monochrome dress.",73726,4
73726,This has looked great and the dress looked great.,73726,4
73726,"This gem looks very noble, is well made.",73726,4
73726,For this price a real bargain!,73726,4
73727,"Class A No 1 construction: All working parts are metal to metal, ie.",73727,4
73727,no threads in wood to strip out.,73727,4
73727,"Beachwood, is a much harder, denser and close grained wood than either pine, which has soft and hard rings or cedar which is a much softer wood, ie.",73727,4
73727,less strong and more prone to split and less likely to handle the mechanical stresses at the mechanical interfaces.,73727,4
73727,"Miusco Shoe Stretcher for Length and Width is Very well designed, comes with clear instructions and is easy to use.",73727,4
73727,I have only 1 unfulfilled wish.,73727,4
73727,"the width stops short of being wide enough to stretch a size 10 D shoe, which is a men's standard width, a scotch wider.",73727,4
73727,"****
  Now for the missing 5th *  Injected molded sleeves similar to the point of discomfort small, black  inserts  to add a eighth more width to each halve would be relatively inexpensive to make and add a versatility not found in any other product of this nature that I have found.",73727,4
73727,Do this at your own risk.,73727,4
73727,"You can wrap them in stuff to add bulk to the width achieve similar results, but you must be careful when you do so to avoid bad consequences.",73727,4
73727,The 'stuff' must expand with the wooden toe pieces and not bind or you run the risk of damaging the tool and/or your shoes.,73727,4
73730,I love the shirt.,73730,4
73730,Just runs WAY small.,73730,4
73731,love my shirt....love amazon !,73731,4
73732,It looks good and fits great.,73732,4
73733,This shirt is cute and is a decent quality.,73733,4
73733,Because it is a seasonal item I expect to get many years of wear out of it.,73733,4
73734,cool & comfortable !,73734,4
73735,"Came as stated, nice material.",73735,4
73735,1 time drying made it very stIff however.,73735,4
73736,I didn't read the fine print regarding the sizing but the item was too small for me.,73736,4
73736,So I contacted the manufacturers and they resolved the issue speedily with an item that did fit.,73736,4
73736,Therefore I am happy & a satisfied customer.,73736,4
73737,Not big enough for a Samsung note 4 phone.,73737,4
73738,"Love the outfit, my son is 5 months old and I got the 6 to 12 month size he weighs 18 pounds and is 26"" long and the outfit fit him perfectly, however you can see gaps between the snaps on his legs so I don't think it would fit a 12 month old unless they were tiny so I gave it 4 stars.",73738,4
73738,It washed well and is super cute!,73738,4
73741,"I'm 5'2 "" 124 lbs ordered a small.",73741,4
73741,The arms are a bit tight though.,73741,4
73742,"Overall, I really like these new Fruit of the Loom Briefs.",73742,4
73742,My only problem is the fit seems a little larger than expected but that may be the result of the type of briefs they are.,73742,4
73742,These seems to come farther up past my waistline which I don't like but its not a deal breaker.,73742,4
73742,I've not worn Fruit of the Loom for many years now instead wearing Calvin Klein so it's nice to see that more emphasis has been put into the quality of the product but I guess the real test will be how long they last.,73742,4
73742,"As for my Calvin's, well the quality in those have gone down hill recently while the price continues to go up.",73742,4
73743,I wasn't expecting much out of these $10 boots.,73743,4
73743,I mean come on how good can they be at this price?,73743,4
73743,Well they are no designer boots but they are definitely cute and fit just fine.,73743,4
73743,About the same quality you would get from Target but at an extremely reasonable price.,73743,4
73743,I could get 3 pairs of these for the price of 1 from Target.,73743,4
73743,So kind of a no brainer here.,73743,4
73743,I would give 5 stars but there are just a couple little things that bug me slightly.,73743,4
73743,"The shape over the top of the foot is a little odd, shaped more like a slipper boot but not too obvious unless they are in your face.",73743,4
73743,However that does give more room for a thicker sock with out cutting off your circulation.,73743,4
73743,They do have nice toe room.,73743,4
73743,"I am borderline needing wide width, depending on the brand but most medium width fit fine.",73743,4
73743,They could use a little more cushion in the sole but they are not uncomfortable at all.,73743,4
73743,Would be fine for going out or shopping.,73743,4
73743,Can't say I would wear them if I had to stand and walk all day just because there is very little shock absorption or cushion.,73743,4
73743,"Usually u get what you pay for but for $10 a pop, these boots can not be beat.",73743,4
73743,I'm ordering a few more colors and checking out some other styles.,73743,4
73743,I can now afford to have a different pair of boots for everyday of the week!,73743,4
73744,Top quality for the price.,73744,4
73744,Sturdy functional and look good as hell,73744,4
73745,They are what I expected,73745,4
73747,Clear and durable for the low low price,73747,4
73748,Great basic thin hoodie for a good price.,73748,4
73749,"cute dress, tight fit",73749,4
73750,I brought this to wear for a Royal Rumble event that I was hosting and everyone loved it.,73750,4
73751,"There's a few minor scratches on the backside of the clasp of 2/4 of the hoops, but it's not visible unless it's not on your ear, but the studs came with a nearly perfect casting and no scratches.",73751,4
73751,"The only real complaint I have with these is that the blue hoop is quite a few shades darker then pictured, but still visibly blue, and the gold is also darker then pictured, but still a good clean color.",73751,4
73751,"Also, keep in mind that the hoops are a smaller size, so if your piercings are high up on your lobes, they may not fit without squishing your lobe.",73751,4
73752,"While I love the color and material, this jacket was way too small for my husband.",73752,4
73752,As to be expected with Asian sizing.,73752,4
73752,I wish they would get American XL.,73752,4
73752,"If you're an XL, and muscular this jacket is not going to work.",73752,4
73752,Unfortunately it would cost more to ship back then I paid so I will have to donate to someone.,73752,4
73752,Recommend if you're a slim guy!,73752,4
73753,It was about a week late shipping.,73753,4
73753,But I love the product.,73753,4
73754,Heavy duty product great size for my needs but cheaply(ish) made..?,73754,4
73754,One of the zipper holders had large sharp extra piece of metal hanging off I had to shave down.,73754,4
73754,With tools that I don't exactly have laying around my studio.,73754,4
73754,Not a big deal but a lot of extra work for a simple purchase.,73754,4
73755,I just bought this for the time turner necklace.,73755,4
73755,"It's pretty cool, it turns and everything.i just wish it was on a slinger chain, like in the movie.",73755,4
73755,"I haven't opened the other jewelry, but it looks nice.",73755,4
73755,I plan to give them away as gifts.,73755,4
73755,Great deal for the set.,73755,4
73756,Runs kind of small.,73756,4
73756,"Fits more like a loose shirt then a jacket, however I like it.",73756,4
73757,I wish it didn't have rubber in the sleeve and around the waist.,73757,4
73757,"Otherwise, the jacket is a great fit.",73757,4
73758,this would be nicer if it had a little stretch.,73758,4
73759,this coin purse replaces a similar one I have used for over 20 yrs.,73759,4
73759,"It is small, soft leather with 2 zipper pockets.",73759,4
73759,I have room for my id and credit cards along with my medical cards I must carry .,73759,4
73759,It will also hold bills.,73759,4
73759,The side zipper compartment holds my change.,73759,4
73759,The only thing is breaking it in is needed so that it relaxes and is not stiff  to handle.,73759,4
73759,It has a ring so I can attach it to my POC and not worry with a larger purse.,73759,4
73760,It's basically just a piece of black ribbon but it's a cute trendy accessory to add to a button down blouse.,73760,4
73760,I bet you can get this for half the price at a craft store.,73760,4
73760,It's great for people like me who don't want to bother getting crafty.,73760,4
73762,Got the 24 months size for my very petite 18 month old and it was way too small!,73762,4
73762,I didn't want to hassle with return so I lost money.,73762,4
73762,"Very cute print though and nice thick material so I ordered another, I just wish I would have ordered size 3t the first time.",73762,4
73762,I will give the smaller size one as a gift since I never used it.,73762,4
73762,The Ruffle butt on these is super cute and it's nice that there is snaps on the sides so they are easy to remove.,73762,4
73762,I prefer these over saggy disposable swim diapers under a swim suit.,73762,4
73762,With either one pee still goes through.,73762,4
73762,Matched perfect with the pink shell rash guard top and my baby looked adorable at the beach.,73762,4
73762,There was no irritation to her thighs like other reviewers complained about.,73762,4
73763,Good light weight shoe...had to add insole for more support.,73763,4
73765,Fit as expected but ordered a size larger.,73765,4
73765,"She wears a size 16 (US) 40D-36-42 at 5'3"" and 150+ :) so ordered the XXL and it fits nice.",73765,4
73766,Looks just like on the mannequin with  the low back.,73766,4
73766,Which I didn't want it to be like that.,73766,4
73766,Bought the black and forest green and they're both the same.,73766,4
73768,Made nice and great price!,73768,4
73769,"I'' 5-7"" and 135, bought a small and it was a little smaller than I'd expected, probably would get a medium if I did it again.",73769,4
73770,We love our Elmo jammies.,73770,4
73770,"The shorts are a little short compared to other jammie shorts, but we have an exceptionally long child, so everything is short on us.",73770,4
73770,They seem to be good quality so far.,73770,4
73771,Ran just a little smaller than expected once washed,73771,4
73772,I like these socks..,73772,4
73772,Somewhat thicker than I anticipated.,73772,4
73773,"I really like this bracelet, it's very shiny and beautiful in the sunlight, and it appears to be the real thing if you're not scrutinizing it.",73773,4
73773,"But I give it 4 stars because after wearing it for only a week, the inside of the bracelet has already lost the white gold plating and it's very dull and grey looking.",73773,4
73773,I have not worn it in or around water to try and prolong the life of the plating.,73773,4
73773,"But living in Florida, I guess the sweat of everyday life has caused it to loose it's shine.",73773,4
73773,"But again, for the price it is a pretty bracelet that will do for some occasions.",73773,4
73774,"I own this shirt in every color now, my shoulders are narrow as relative to my wider hips, and I have a large bra size, I am 5'3.",73774,4
73774,So I would normally wear a small or Xsmall but I wear a LARGE in this top.,73774,4
73774,It fits like an Xsmall on me in my shoulders and neck but is long enough and stretches to fit my hips.,73774,4
73774,"So I love this shirt, thankfully this worked because I read the reviews and knew to size way up.",73774,4
73774,It's super fitted even in a large but it's one of the few tops that doesn't make me look sloppy.,73774,4
73774,Because of my shape I look sloppy in anything not fitted.,73774,4
73774,When I get these I noticed the materials are different from shipment to shipment and they can vary an inch in length.,73774,4
73776,The material is not what I thought it would be,73776,4
73777,Somewhat big but nothing too drastic,73777,4
73779,Well worth the money.,73779,4
73780,Wish it had a better phone holder.,73780,4
73780,I have a an Iphone 6+,73780,4
73781,"It's a beautiful costume, nice material.",73781,4
73781,"My wife is a medium and 5'4"" 135 lbs with 34D and we had to order a 2XL AND IT fit fine...the fabled zipper problem is not a problem at all.",73781,4
73781,Some people just whine too much!!,73781,4
73782,Nice medium weight tee that held up well in the first washing.,73782,4
73783,These leggings are a bit see-thru.,73783,4
73783,Not what I was hoping however they fit ok on my size 14 body.,73783,4
73784,Love the feel of these jeans.,73784,4
73784,I will be ordering more colors.,73784,4
73784,This time I will go down one size.,73784,4
73784,But I love them,73784,4
73785,"I have a 23.25"" head.",73785,4
73785,"I've read other reviews and went with a medium, and it fit perfectly.",73785,4
73785,Hat is good quality.,73785,4
73786,"Dress even more beautiful in person, it is a little snug for me as I am a curvy woman and an older woman, the slit a little higher for someone of my age, but beautiful all the same, recommend this dress.",73786,4
73787,I really like these.,73787,4
73787,"They keep my feet super warm, however they are just a tad too big.",73787,4
73787,"I wear a size 8, and they are still big.",73787,4
73788,nice light shirt for the summer!,73788,4
73788,"fits good, but arms are a little tight if raised above head",73788,4
73789,I wish it had netting underware inside likek my other boardshorts.,73789,4
73790,I love that jacket and it looks great one me.,73790,4
73790,"But there are 2 missing braided leather strings for my both arms and it looks really ""s*** "" so I took out from both sides and put on both arms.",73790,4
73790,It looked much better.,73790,4
73790,I wrote to seller and they never never  respond.,73790,4
73790,Maybe they ignored me.,73790,4
73791,They are comfortable for flip flops.,73791,4
73791,I love the way they feel with that cushion sole.,73791,4
73791,They twist on you when you walk backwards.,73791,4
73791,I can wear them for a few hours but then I need to change into other shoes.,73791,4
73792,Cute bracelets but not good for hair ties like I bought it for,73792,4
73793,"A bit cheap, but not unexpectedly so.",73793,4
73793,"Cute, but still, don't expect this to last forever.",73793,4
73794,They are cool-looking beanies.,73794,4
73796,Fits just right and is super cute!,73796,4
73797,I should have got a size bigger.,73797,4
73797,But it is serving its purpose.,73797,4
73798,I absolutely love my necklace.,73798,4
73798,"The chain is a little thin, but the monogram piece is stunning.",73798,4
73798,I get lots of compliments on it.,73798,4
73798,"I've had it since 10/14/2016, & have had no issues thus far.",73798,4
73798,"I ordered the 18"" silver tone chain.",73798,4
73798,"I probably will get a 16"" chain next, with the 10% off coupon that they gave me!",73798,4
73799,It's a bit long.,73799,4
73800,I'm much better off.,73800,4
73801,Uniquely designed & one of a kind.,73801,4
73801,Goes well with casual wear and a dressy occasion.,73801,4
73803,Very thin material and the lighter color is more of a cream to off white color than white as pictured.,73803,4
73803,I like the style but for me because the back is more revealing than I am comfortable so I will be wearing a wrap or jacket.,73803,4
73804,Go up 1 size.,73804,4
73804,Other than than they are quality pants.,73804,4
73805,It's good for what I need it for.,73805,4
73805,I need a cover up to wear when I color my hair.,73805,4
73805,The old one I was using was decades old.,73805,4
73807,"Too snug to wear in public but fun for lounging in at home, assuming you're a big geek.",73807,4
73808,Bought it for my Mom as a gag gift!,73808,4
73808,"It was perfect for what I needed, it was large, wish it was V neck.",73808,4
73809,"i love the hat for the price only thing i didn't like was the packaging,
it came in what was basically a a plastic bag and the delivery person just stuffed it in to my mail box
flattening the hat..
still hat is made very well.",73809,4
73809,"its one of my favorite hats, that i own",73809,4
73810,We put this crystal in the center of a chandelier we made for a reception.,73810,4
73810,It reflected the sunlight in a beautiful way!,73810,4
73812,I have trouble with the plastic clear balls so these work the best for me.,73812,4
73812,The only thing I don't like is after its been in for a while the gems seem to loosen and chip a little.,73812,4
73813,Haven't worn yet but cute for the summer and into fall.,73813,4
73814,This dress is very pretty and the material is fair.,73814,4
73814,But i have a big butt which makes it a bit hard to wear because its very short.,73814,4
73814,It runs a bit small.,73814,4
73814,Even though i ordered a size up it was a bit small on me.,73814,4
73816,"Fit just as I expected, I usually buy mediums for all my clothing and purchased a medium for this and it fit well.",73816,4
73816,Very thin material so I would not recommend for something to wear to the beach and I do not recommend for women with larger breasts (I'm 34B).,73816,4
73816,I do recommend wearing pasties to make your breasts appear smooth.,73816,4
73816,The color is true to the image provided.,73816,4
73817,There great my granddaughter is crazy about them,73817,4
73820,Liked it alright picture shows lot more detail than product has.,73820,4
73820,But price was right.,73820,4
73821,"shrank some, but still ok, fabric is a bit lightweight.",73821,4
73822,"Only 4 stars because 1) your thin ball skin will start pushing through the fabric holes if you wear these for long periods, 2) I think the sides should, and could, be narrower, 3) the pouch sizes aren't all the same size, not a big diff, but you def notice the smaller pouch, 4) this same, or improved, pattern would be great with a smooth non-hole fabric thong.",73822,4
73822,"'Breathe holes' great idea in theory, but not a good idea in practice.",73822,4
73823,My son loves this.,73823,4
73823,He is 5t so I got a size six and it just fit.,73823,4
73823,I would buy a size bigger.,73823,4
73824,"I am 5'3, 162 lbs.",73824,4
73824,I wear a 36D bra and a size 12 or medium dress.,73824,4
73824,I ordered a medium based on other reviews and was pleased to see that this dress fit me just right.,73824,4
73824,It super cute and flattering.,73824,4
73824,Can't wait to wear it with a cute pair of wedge heels!,73824,4
73825,"Works like a charm, charges slowly overnight the only thing I'm mot satisfied with is that the wire is short and it doesn't come with the little chargerbox thingy you plug in the outlet .",73825,4
73825,Other than that pretty good item for its price,73825,4
73826,Love it and have just ordered another top!!!,73826,4
73827,Seems to run a little big but overall nice jacket.,73827,4
73828,"It's pretty , the zippers where alittle stuck when I got it it's a real large bag wish it was a bit smaller over all its okay

Ok new feed back the straps falls off the clamp is not closed properly so I need to fix it inconvenience for me",73828,4
73829,I really like this little clutch.,73829,4
73829,A seam ripped during a trip but the company replaced it without any problem.,73829,4
73830,"This outfit is very adorable, and fits my son great....for the most part.",73830,4
73830,The pants are really small.,73830,4
73830,My son wears a 3T/4T.,73830,4
73830,I ordered this in a 4T.,73830,4
73830,"The top and vest fit him perfect, but the pants are almost too small for him.",73830,4
73830,The quality is excellent.,73830,4
73830,"If the pants fit more how I was expecting, I would have given this 5 stars.",73830,4
73831,I bought this bag with a heavy heart as I was search the world for a hand bag that wasn't too big to fit my 12inch laptop.,73831,4
73831,This one was perfect.,73831,4
73831,Looks better than the picture to.,73831,4
73831,Really enjoy wearing it,73831,4
73833,Very cute and pretty.,73833,4
73833,The cups are not molded in the slightest like the picture shows.,73833,4
73834,"looks nice, feels great!",73834,4
73835,The fit wasn't what I expected.. A little big buts it's okay..,73835,4
73836,Color is much lighter then picture.,73836,4
73836,It is actually a baby blue but still my son loves that they light up.,73836,4
73836,Mine did not come with charger like it says either.,73836,4
73837,Bra was too big...but looks just as shown in the picture.,73837,4
73838,really cute looks like picture just to small :(,73838,4
73839,Buy 1/2 size up - super cute  :),73839,4
73840,I just got my suit and I am pretty happy with it.,73840,4
73840,"I would say though only being 6' 0"" and about 180 lbs I was hoping it would fit a little better.",73840,4
73840,It's pretty tight and very revealing around the groin.,73840,4
73840,May want to invest in a jockstrap if you're going to be in a public place wearing this.,73840,4
73841,But it's a beautiful color,73841,4
73842,I was just a tad bit small but nothing much to complain about.,73842,4
73842,I love the shirt!,73842,4
73843,"Marked as a 3X, fits like a XL for U.S. citizens.",73843,4
73844,I LOVE this but the material is pretty cheap so it rips and snags easily.,73844,4
73844,Just be gentle with it.,73844,4
73845,"My son loves the characters, so these are a big hit.",73845,4
73845,The biggest complaint is that these are small around his leg openings.,73845,4
73845,"My son is in 24month or 2T clothes, definitely has thick, chunky legs, but I never thought undies would be too tight for him.",73845,4
73845,"He has a little trouble getting them on and off on his own, but eventually makes it work.",73845,4
73845,Surprisingly the padded undies actually fit him better.,73845,4
73846,"I purchased two of these belts - the first one I opened the belt buckle was broken, the other one was fine.",73846,4
73846,Being allergic to metal this belt was great.,73846,4
73846,I am going to order more!,73846,4
73846,I only gave it 4 stars as I do not like to send things back.,73846,4
73846,I do not like it when things are broken or missing in an order.,73846,4
73846,"However, the return was very easy - just wish they could have sent me another belt verses a refund.",73846,4
73847,"I really like these boots
Got a lot of compliment the first time I wore them
They don't keep feet warm so you need padding and warm socks
I wore them for 10 hours and my feet hurt when I got home.",73847,4
73847,"But I work in health care and never sit
So hey aren't built for all day wear
But they are very nice and seem sturdy
Just need to use insoles and wool socks",73847,4
73848,"Love this hat, but it is a bit small.",73848,4
73849,I can't say anything bad about this romper!,73849,4
73849,It fit me great and was made of a breathable material which makes it great for the summer.,73849,4
73849,Wearing black in the heat isn't the best idea but because I have to as part of my uniform it sure helps that the material is so breathable.,73849,4
73849,It's not at all see through and is a very modest fit.,73849,4
73849,My favorite part is that the leg part of the romper is that it hugs my highs so it doesn't make the romper look so frumpy like I had envisioned.,73849,4
73850,Love the feel of this!,73850,4
73850,"As I'm short, the garters are too long and I cannot wear them.",73850,4
73850,But I have this problem ALL the time!,73850,4
73850,"Thankfully they are detachable, so it's a cute and sexy nightie.",73850,4
73852,It came pretty fast considering was coming from Germany.,73852,4
73852,Very well made and fit as expected.,73852,4
73852,Wish the fabric was slightly different material but for the price is great.,73852,4
73852,Perfect for short people which is nice because most clothes are made for much taller people.,73852,4
73852,Bottom line good skirt for cheap,73852,4

73856,Fits nice well made and super cute,73856,4
73857,"This is a beautiful top, but the mesh material isn't exactly what I expected and the shoulder straps are quit a bit wider than I thought they would be.",73857,4
73857,The color is gorgeous but I returned this item in favor of a less-squareish top - it's just not quite my style.,73857,4
73858,Nice product and great quality but runs too small.,73858,4
73858,Espalma is known for this type of raised waffle weave.,73858,4

73868,The kids at the Hospital will love love love it,73868,4
73869,Needs about 1-2 more inches of width,73869,4
73870,Shoe seems to be good for the money.,73870,4
73870,I usually wear a 10 in new balance and it fit just like the others.,73870,4
73871,The material for these pants!,73871,4
73871,They are thick enough that they aren't see through yet breathable.,73871,4
73871,The only issue I have with these is that they run a size big in my opinion.,73871,4
73871,I have muscly thighs and usually wear a medium in EVERYTHING fitness.,73871,4
73871,I should've ordered a small in these though.,73871,4
73871,But I will def be buying more..in a small!,73871,4

73875,Cute bathing suit but it isn't a push-up top.,73875,4
73875,If you are wanting a push-up top don't order this bathing suit.,73875,4
73875,The material is nice and is well made.,73875,4
73875,My only complaint is it isn't a push-up top as it was described.,73875,4
73876,Ordered this for a vacation.,73876,4
73876,The bottoms run very small so size up if you want the bottoms to fit.,73876,4

73876,You may only be able to wear one or the other.,73876,4
73876,"Thankfully, I read reviews and knew to do this before buying.",73876,4
73876,I ended up getting this to wear the top and paired it with several different colored solid bottoms I already have.,73876,4
73876,"The bottoms were much too small, but I have a friend who could wear them with a solid top she already had.",73876,4
73876,Win win for the both of us!,73876,4

73878,I ordered a 2T-4T for my almost 3 year old.,73878,4
73878,"The only downside is the brim becomes extremely floppy when wet and would completely cover her face at times, which annoyed her and made her take it off.",73878,4

73879,"Wish it had more slots for cards, etc",73879,4

73880,But relaxes to the for for you.,73880,4

73889,The one missing star is against my own computer.,73889,4
73889,"It displayed the shirt a darker blue than it actually is, it appeared more as a Navy blue but was actually a Royal blue.",73889,4
73889,I kept it anyway though because it fit perfectly and was of sound quality just the same.,73889,4
73890,It was too small but a nice sweater.,73890,4
73892,comfortable and looks nice,73892,4
73893,I think a MoM shirt should have more of a female cut.... but i love it otherwise.,73893,4
73894,The shirt is very soft and fits comfortably.,73894,4
73894,I would order it in a smaller size if you want a snug fit,73894,4
73895,I did have to return it but I would've kept it if my shoulders weren't as wide as they are!,73895,4
73895,Couldn't really move around in it.,73895,4
73895,But it was very cute!,73895,4
73897,Love love love it!,73897,4
73897,It's not the same material as shown in the picture (its not t-shirt material it's more of a dressy fabric) and the fit is perfect!,73897,4
73897,I'm small but curvy but it contours to my body nicely.,73897,4
73897,One of  my new favorite pieces :),73897,4

73899,"Hands have been fine except for one snowy, cloudy day.. at the top of the mountain and after about 4-5 hrs my hands were frozen.",73899,4
73899,Don't really blame the gloves though.,73899,4
73899,"The fingertips have some material that has started to come off after about 4 or 5 days on the mountain, going pretty hard each time (and building some jumps by hand).",73899,4
73899,Overall I'm very pleased with them.,73899,4
73899,Only gripe is that there's no cinch for the end of the glove.,73899,4
73900,Fits nicely and it is comfortable,73900,4
73901,The Quality of the material was actually better than I expected.. After reading several reviews I was so nervous that I would receive just fabric..,73901,4
73901,But the marijuana leaf bikini was actual swimsuit material.,73901,4
73901,I ordered an XL in my opinion this is an L and that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars..,73901,4
73901,But other than that it's great especially for the price..,73901,4
73901,I will modify it myself because the cups it came with did not my fit my breast I'm a 36C..,73901,4
73901,But other than that very cute bikini!,73901,4
73901,Also could not contact seller so another reason for the 4 stars,73901,4
73903,"Nice muscle shirt, if you wear Large you'll need to wear Xlarge.",73903,4
73904,Super huge and long.,73904,4
73904,Will work fine as a dress though.,73904,4
73905,These are decent for the price.,73905,4
73905,The arch could be a bit higher for me but overall they do the trick.,73905,4
73905,I like how they absorb impact and that they fit the entire shoe.,73905,4
73905,No moving around under your foot and no need to pull your shoe off an readjust.throughout the day like those other supports.,73905,4
73906,Great purse for the price !,73906,4
73906,It was bigger than what I expected.,73906,4

73908,Fit my husband well.,73908,4
73908,Some of the previous ones we tried were too small.,73908,4
73908,This one adjusts better and keeps him warm.,73908,4
73909,My daughter loves them!,73909,4
73910,"A little bigger than I expected, that might just be because of the size/shape of my face though.",73910,4
73910,"Great quality metal, not flimsy, and stones are all nice and attached well.",73910,4
73911,I thought that these were child size and bought them for my two young grandchildren as we went to Disney Land.,73911,4
73911,However these are adult size in the waist so I had to cut the straps and resew them together so they would fit the boys.,73911,4
73911,Once this was done they were perfect and ready for Disneyland,73911,4
73912,I bought the first one and I'm just buying the second one because they are that good,73912,4
73913,Man I love these.,73913,4
73913,Never have I felt so much like a 1960's band groupie as I do with the glasses.,73913,4
73913,"They are not super high quality, if you sit on them, they are done for sure.",73913,4
73913,The arms are a bit flimsy and would be easy to break.,73913,4
73913,"That said, I don't care, because they look so awesome.",73913,4
73913,"The heart frames actually really flatter my face shape, and these were the only pair I could find that weren't pink or purple, or generally looked like they were meant for a 10 year old.",73913,4
73913,"They may not be bullet proof, but they are so affordable, if mine ever break, I will absolutely buy a new pair.",73913,4

73915,The color is gorgeous and true to the picture.,73915,4
73915,The top is ideal for modesty without losing the feminine look.,73915,4
73915,The top does cut in slightly under the arm towards the bust.,73915,4
73915,So this made a bra challenging.,73915,4
73915,"My daughter had to duct tape herself together to keep from having ""side boob"".",73915,4
73915,"She is rather busty, so if you aren't then you may not have this issue.",73915,4
73915,The crisscross in the back was lovely.,73915,4
73915,The length was perfect.,73915,4

73920,Very absorbent and cute.,73920,4
73920,They are a little smaller then what I expected.,73920,4

73921,"Is so beautiful I love it, I don't give 5 start cause is fit Little bit large, although I fix by my self and fit perfect",73921,4

73924,It fit great on the hips and huge on the top!,73924,4
73924,But that's just because of my body type.,73924,4
73924,I have big hips and thighs but small upper body.,73924,4
73924,I would get a medium if it wasn't $20 more!,73924,4

73938,Have received a few compliments when wearing it.,73938,4
73939,"These socks work well with the smaller hand warmers but you need boots that are a little large, so you can get everything in the boot easy and are comfortable.",73939,4
73939,"Sock is made good and take your time getting them on, only when you arrive at a spot where you plan to fish or where you plan to walk in.",73939,4

73941,"Beware, The dress I recieved was a rosey/ pink gold,  not actually gold!",73941,4
73941,That's why I only gave it 4 stars.,73941,4
73941,"However, it fit very nice so I just ordered it in black.",73941,4

73946,Not a lot of arch support but really lightweight.,73946,4
73947,I like it however the neckline is pretty wide and I am a wide framed person so average person could where this off the shoulders,73947,4
73950,I have not worn it for an extended time but for the little while I had it on it really held my stomach and midsection in nicely.,73950,4
73950,It didn't lift my butt at all but I am naturally gifted in other areas so I wasn't expecting a miracle.,73950,4

73955,I'm glad I read the reviews and ordered a size up.,73955,4
73955,"Even that was a little tight, but I think two sizes up would have been too big.",73955,4
73955,"Mine arrived very wrinkled, so make sure you have the time to steam/iron it before you need to wear it.",73955,4

73961,"They fit my legs, hips, and butt, but I had 3 inches to spare at the waist.",73961,4
73961,I'll be returning them.,73961,4
73961,But I'm giving them four stars because I have somewhat unusual proportions and I think for many people the fit would be good.,73961,4
73961,"They are high-waisted, I'm not sure why the previous comment says that.",73961,4
73962,"These legging are soft and of good quality they do run a little Big , but was very happy with them !",73962,4

73969,The fit is good..can just tell you get what you pay for.,73969,4
73969,Definitely something you will need to hand wash or wash on gentle and line dry it but still worth it because it's cute,73969,4
73971,I love them but they're a little tight but that's only because I have wide feet.,73971,4
73972,"Great bathing suit looks exactly like the picture posted, I would recommend getting a size up though because it runs pretty small",73972,4

73981,"I wouldn't recommend this if you can't pull off a backless adhesive bra o going without a bra entirely, the straps aren't really quite as wide as you may think.",73981,4
73982,Was so soft and fit great,73982,4
73983,A little on the thinner side for material.,73983,4
73983,Other then that I love it,73983,4
73984,"I am new into waist cinchers, but spent quite a bit of time looking before making my purchase.",73984,4
73984,I was very please with the quality of the product.,73984,4
73984,There was nothing else in the package aside from the garment.,73984,4
73984,"I guess I was expecting to see some type of tag attached, and maybe even a card with some helpful hints?",73984,4
73984,"I ordered the XL  Long cut thinking that that as a tall woman, I am 5'9"" weighing about 170 lbs with a 33 "" waist, that the long cut would be a better fit.",73984,4
73984,"The sizing in diameter is spot on, but I think I am going to need to change this corset for the regular length one.",73984,4
73984,"It is a tad too high under the bust line, and the part that points up in the middle is too high and really digs into me.",73984,4
73984,"My only other disappointment,, and this isn't really the garments fault, is the spillage I am having on the top of my back.",73984,4
73984,I am going to need to play around with some bra's and see if one with a wider band can help control that.,73984,4
73984,"If it wasn't for the fact the the corset is too long, I found it comfortable, liked the back support I got from it, and had no issues breathing.",73984,4
73984,"Hopefully once I get the correct length, the ""girls"" won't pour out as bad...I like them supported, but at 50 years old, I don't need them at my chin!",73984,4
73984,"lol (it only looks bad with my arms down)
Shipping was fast, and hopefully the return will be painless.",73984,4
73984,I am looking forward to receiving the next one!,73984,4
73984,I would purchase this item from the seller again.,73984,4
73986,I liked the shirts!,73986,4
73986,They fit as expected however they will require a little more maintenance in that they are not wrinkle free.,73986,4
73987,Would have given it 5 stars but colors were much duller in person,73987,4
73989,I read the reviews and ordered a size smaller than I usually wear.,73989,4
73989,But I wish I just went with what I normally buy.,73989,4
73989,Now I have to exchange it.,73989,4
73989,"I weigh about 119 on a skinny day :) am 5'7"" and wear a 34DD and Not gonna lie, I was more than a little mashed.",73989,4
73989,The costume itself is the thick foam/velveteen stuff so it will have creases and lines in it that even steaming may not get out.,73989,4
73989,"The skirt is the ""super"" (ha) thin metallic stretchy material, but swishy and cute.",73989,4
73989,"If they really wanted to do this costume ""justice"" (<------ punny ;) then they would add a zipper and boning.",73989,4
73989,"Maybe then, life would be magical, and I would walk around in this outfit fighting  crime daily.",73989,4
73990,"I prefer my shorts to be shorter than what is more commonly found in stores, and these are great.",73990,4
73990,I bought the green shorts and they look just like the picture.,73990,4
73990,Bought them for lounging around home after work and sleeping in them.,73990,4
73990,Only complaint is the pockets are not hardly functional at all.,73990,4
73990,"Other than that, I totally recommend these.",73990,4
73991,They are cute but cane with a few snags.,73991,4
73992,..Fits nicely and is very comfortable.,73992,4
73992,"However, when I ordered additional tops in different colors the size was not the same and therefor did not fit like the first one.",73992,4
73992,After the second and third attempts to get a similar top with the same problems I gave up and returned them both and considered myself lucky that at least the first one was nice.,73992,4
73992,Also as other customers pointed out the labels on the top were not Lilbetter..,73992,4
73993,this shirt is great.,73993,4
73993,True to size but once you wash it (i didn't even dry mine) it shrinks a bit.,73993,4
73993,Next time i will probably hand wash it.,73993,4
73993,I love that its ribbed so you don't necessarily have to wear a bra,73993,4
73994,"Looser fit on the thighs for someone small-medium, at least in early pregnancy.",73994,4
73994,"The adjustable waist-band was a massive boon in early pregnancy when ""morning"" (ha ha!)",73994,4
73994,Generally increased my comfort levels all round.,73994,4
73994,"Because of how baggy it was on me, only suitable for very casual use.",73994,4
73995,I am a size 12-14 and I purchased an XL.,73995,4
73995,It fit me as expected I did have to adjust the zipper a little but not much.,73995,4
73995,Overall happy with my purchase.,73995,4
73997,Not as big as I thought but nice,73997,4
73998,"Got matching rings for myself and girlfriend, we both love them and wear them every day.",73998,4
73998,Fit is about 1/2 size small due to it being a wider ring.,73998,4
73999,"Nice bathing suit, but runs much smaller than advertising",73999,4
74000,Only wish it was more tailored fit.,74000,4
74000,Hard to find in plus.,74000,4
74001,The fabric feels very nice against the skin.,74001,4
74001,The workmanship is good.,74001,4
74002,The wig was in good condition after shipping with lots of cute pin curls.,74002,4
74002,"It fit well, held up nicely for a full day of wear and came with a wig cap.",74002,4
74002,Highly recommended if you need a Snow White wig for Halloween!,74002,4
74003,"Fits appropriately, stays in place for the most part",74003,4
74004,I had to return it for a larger size.,74004,4
74004,"Still a little snug, but I kept it.",74004,4
74004,"Otherwise, I really like the coat.",74004,4
74005,Definitely a size or two larger than it says in the product description.,74005,4
74005,The smallest size was really hard to get in.,74005,4
74005,But they are really pretty and will definitely do the job.,74005,4
74006,Wish the material was a little thicker.,74006,4
74006,A little worried it will tear.,74006,4
74006,But it will get the job done.,74006,4
74007,I really like this bag.,74007,4
74007,It is very light weight so the only weight is all the stuff I have in it.,74007,4
74007,All the pockets make it easy to organize and find things.,74007,4
74007,I can carry all I want but it is not a huge bag.,74007,4
74007,The only thing I'm a little concerned about is the zippers.,74007,4
74007,They seen a little fragile and won't zip unless all the teeth are perfectly lined up.,74007,4
74007,"Overall, I would recommend this bag.",74007,4
74008,This is beautiful but not real thick but i live in texas so with a long sleeve an this im good i recommend ive had it maybe 2 years an i still wear it..an yea i know im barely writting a review don't judge :),74008,4
74009,it is vary nice,74009,4
74010,I bought the galaxy print and get compliments on them all the time.,74010,4
74010,And they are so comfy!,74010,4
74011,I love the feel and the shape.,74011,4
74011,It's stretchy but it's gaps at the crossover on me.,74011,4
74011,But overall I am very pleased,74011,4
74012,I got it for a gift for my bf and he loves it completely.,74012,4
74015,Looking for an inexpensive shirt that fits... this did the job.,74015,4
74015,Not the best quality but more than what you pay for.,74015,4
74016,I get so many compliments but the jacket did tear at the seam during the first wash.,74016,4
74018,Its a nice shirt but its NOT officially licensed (not from DC).,74018,4
74018,The printing is definitely not the best.,74018,4
74018,Up close you can see the distortion between lines.,74018,4
74018,"I was worried about the completely white backside, but its not bad.",74018,4
74018,"After putting the shirt on, it looks ok, so at least it's wearable.",74018,4
74020,because i love work out,74020,4
74021,These earrings are just adorable!,74021,4
74021,I do have a bit of trouble with them staying in the right position though.,74021,4
74021,I have to bend then a bit to get them to stay.,74021,4
74022,The size of the bag is perfect.,74022,4
74022,"I was able to put a half inch binder, wallet and a few small things and zip.",74022,4
74022,The zippers are everywhere but they are cheap and stick.,74022,4
74022,The price is great but would have paid $10 more for better quality zippers.,74022,4
74022,I still like it.,74022,4
74022,I didn't notice a smell like others.,74022,4
74022,Very long adjustable strap too.,74022,4
74022,It's a great bag really.,74022,4
74023,"The fabric softener s a little cheep looking, but for the price I can't complain",74023,4
74024,The chest is definitely large in the overalls but it still looked pretty cute.,74024,4
74024,I definitely got tons of compliments but wore red leggings underneath.,74024,4
74024,The skirt is SUPER short!,74024,4
74025,Love this shirt but a size 10 is really considered a size small.,74025,4
74025,Beware the sizes run really really small!!!!,74025,4
74026,I was excited to get this belt.,74026,4
74026,The belt does its job and looks good.,74026,4
74026,The reason I didn't give it 5 or 4 stars is because the belt and buckle are very thin...,74026,4
74026,It feels like a $5 belt and not a $30 belt.,74026,4
74026,After the first wear it now has a crimp in it making it harder to adjust in small increments near that place in the belt.,74026,4
74026,"It's got potential but for the price, I'm expecting better material.",74026,4
74026,"****update****
After a few months with it, I've gotten used to the 'lightness' of the belt.",74026,4
74026,It does the job well and crimps are there but not as significant.,74026,4
74026,I wear this belt almost everyday and no signs of it breaking down...,74026,4
74026,I will be buying more down the road.,74026,4
74027,Doesn't look like it does in the picture.,74027,4
74027,"It's not fitted,and it flares at the bottom.",74027,4
74027,Not a bad item just not as pictured.,74027,4
74027,I bought a 2xl because because it said it ran small.,74027,4
74027,It doesn't run small.,74027,4
74029,neat camp for the she,74029,4
74030,"Fabric is stiff, and due to packaging in the smallest possible space, was will take a lot of work to remove the wrinkles.",74030,4
74031,Not so bad for the price was good..,74031,4
74032,Very nice quality for the price.,74032,4
74032,I rated 4 stars only since I have washed only once.,74032,4
74032,I'm hopeful it will wear good after multiple washes.,74032,4
74033,I only bought these shoes for my son to go with his halloween costume.,74033,4
74033,"They do run a little big, but he wore them trick or treating.",74033,4
74034,I am very pleased with my purchase and excited to use this passport cover on an upcoming trip.,74034,4
74034,"The purple orchid color isn't quite as vibrant as the picture, but lovely nonetheless.",74034,4
74034,I also purchased the imperial purple for my mother which is rich and deep.,74034,4
74034,"Overall, the product is simple, but good quality for the price!",74034,4
74035,Very cheap looking purse.,74035,4
74035,I would like to return it.,74035,4
74036,So far this has been a great product.,74036,4
74036,It won't hold much money along with the cards so you may need to carry a money clip along with it.,74036,4
74036,"Overall, I am happy with it so far.",74036,4
74037,"Love it
The only bad thing is that the metal is now much darker.",74037,4
74038,"I'm approximately 5'7"", 135 pounds, slim and slender and I purchased a medium based on reviews.",74038,4
74038,"The medium is very form fitting which I normally wouldn't appreciate though I actually bought these to layer UNDER another, larger tank top so their snugness is okay (as long as they don't shrink too much!).",74038,4
74038,They're also a touch see through but that COULD be because of how tight they are.,74038,4
74038,They're long and cover my bum which is good and the colors are very vibrant!,74038,4
74038,I would order again though next time I think I'll order a size or two up!,74038,4
74039,we only tried French fries so far.,74039,4
74039,it is a new experience and I am sure we will thoroughly enjoy it.,74039,4
74040,I love this top so much.,74040,4
74040,"I'm a size large, so I ordered the large, and it's super comfortable.",74040,4
74041,So far I really like them!,74041,4
74041,They fit and are very pretty.,74041,4
74041,Only problem is that I will have to take them out when I sleep since they'll fall out and I could lose them otherwise.,74041,4
74042,"Had to steam the hat, then stretch it over a pan.",74042,4
74042,Still love the hat .,74042,4
74043,"Comfortable, and ok for the price.",74043,4
74045,Cheap quality but very cute costume,74045,4
74046,"Love these...I normally wear a large, but wanted to make sure they weren't too short.",74046,4
74046,"I'm 5'8, ordered an extra large for length & they are perfect.",74046,4
74046,"Haven't washed them yet, so I can't comment on the durability yet.",74046,4
74047,"I was pleased by the quality of the jacket, it seems well-made and it's very cute.",74047,4
74047,"However, I would definitely say the sizes are for girls, not women.",74047,4
74047,"Based on other reviews, I ordered an XL.",74047,4
74047,"I'm a 36B, smaller frame, and the size was exactly right.",74047,4
74047,"I can button the jacket and it's snug, but not too tight.",74047,4
74047,"The sleeves are not full-length like the picture, they were a short, awkward length so I just rolled them up.",74047,4
74047,"If you can fit in larger girls sizes, you can probably make this work.",74047,4
74048,"The image for the purple shows kind of a burgundy tone, so I wasn't 100% sure what color I was going to get.",74048,4
74048,But I'm super pleased to say that these pants are Seriously Purple.,74048,4
74048,Like a fabulous jewel-tone plum.,74048,4
74048,Super lightweight fabric - but not see through!,74048,4
74048,I think they're really good for California summer weather.,74048,4
74048,"I've dressed them up with slim fitting blouses & statement jewelry for (kind of casual) work, but this could easily be thrown over a bikini to wear to the beach as well.",74048,4
74048,The only downside - they wrinkle easily.,74048,4
74049,I love these tanks for lounging around the house.,74049,4
74049,"They are lightweight, soft and comfortable.",74049,4
74049,"I'm 5'4"" and 140 lbs.",74049,4
74049,The large fit me with a perfect amount of room.,74049,4
74049,Great deal and nice design.,74049,4
74050,The colors are pretty and the fit is nice.,74050,4
74050,It is a very comfortable dress that I can dress up with heels or dress down with sandals.,74050,4
74051,"The belt had a really strong, annoying odor to it when it first arrived but that went away after a few days.",74051,4
74051,I like the belt.,74051,4
74051,Very easy and quick to put on.,74051,4
74051,A little to tricky to get off but it just takes some getting used to.,74051,4
74052,The dress looks as shown in the picture.,74052,4
74052,"I'm 5' 3"", 120lbs and I bought a medium, it fits exact, large would have been a little more comfortable.",74052,4
74052,The material is elastic and has a polyester dressy look.,74052,4
74053,These orthotics work well.,74053,4
74053,"In fact, I now have 4 sets.",74053,4
74053,"So, yes, I would recommend them.",74053,4
74054,"Loved them, but much too large.",74054,4
74055,Nice quality great price,74055,4
74056,They are larger than I expected but that was a nice surprise seeing as though most costume accessories run super small!,74056,4
74056,I am 115 lbs and they are a little big for me to wear so keep that in mind.,74056,4
74056,"However, fast shipping and quality leggings- I would absolutely recommend this company and product to friends!",74056,4
74057,These are very soft cute hats.,74057,4
74057,I'm a sucker for ducks and so hoping it will fit my baby when she's born because that will make for some adorable pics!,74057,4
74057,The only downside is the seam right above the duck's eyes.,74057,4
74057,It kind of looks like an angry duck.,74057,4
74057,Hopefully on a head it will be stretched out enough to not be noticeable.,74057,4
74058,remember the gold chain part is not real.,74058,4
74059,"I wear a size M/L on the top, and a 1-2x on the bottom, so I went with a large, and it was surprisingly too big , even on the bottom!",74059,4
74059,"I would suggest going down 1-2 sizes, and if you're short as I am ( I'm 5'5"") it will hit well below the knees.",74059,4
74059,"But all that being said, it is a well made and nice looking coat, and considering the price, quite a deal!",74059,4
74060,I usually wear a large and I ordered a size up (XL) and it fits like a medium.,74060,4
74060,Would highly recommend getting a bigger size.,74060,4
74060,Nice shirt for a good price,74060,4
74061,order down a size.,74061,4
74062,liked it except that the flowers on the halter area were centered!,74062,4
74062,The fabric is nice and light .,74062,4
74062,I just didn't care for the fit on ME.,74062,4
74062,It's flowy and pretty though.,74062,4
74062,I sent it back.,74062,4
74062,But another dress I have ordered from this brand is very nice.,74062,4
74063,"Quality materials, welI made.",74063,4
74063,"It would be helpful to have the dimensions of all of the parts, including the fabric cord, posted.",74063,4
74063,"This is a very fine, dainty bracelet, appropriate for women.",74063,4
74064,Good product for the price.,74064,4
74064,"It's a little off on the proportions (has a hard time closing just by using most of the slots) and the coin pouch is useless, but it holds tons of cards which is exactly what I was looking for.",74064,4
74064,It's a good wallet and so far the quality is completely holding up.,74064,4
74065,The fuzz comes off on your feet when you wear them and also when I did laundry it got stuck to the whole load.,74065,4
74065,They are warm and soft though,74065,4
74066,My face is a little wide and hence it feels a little pressed on my temples ...,74066,4
74066,Anyhow a good buy,74066,4
74067,Haven't washed it yet so I can't complete the re ire but my grandson loves it !,74067,4
74068,I followed other reviewers remarks and purchased this dress a size up (XL).,74068,4
74068,"Since I was following the sizing chart, I should have bought the size that was recommended for my measurements.",74068,4
74068,I'm 5' 6''/ 150#.,74068,4
74068,"It's not huge, but I will have to alter the belt in back (it's attached on the sides which was not in the description of the dress).",74068,4
74068,It's a bit big but not so much that I couldn't wear it with a little modification of the belt.,74068,4
74068,Looks great with a crinoline slip underneath.,74068,4
74069,"It would get 5 stars if it were about an 1/8"" thicker.",74069,4
74069,Appears to be well made.,74069,4
74071,Love them except I wish I could pick the colors and make them flash strobe style too,74071,4
74072,"Practical, but the zippers failed after the first use",74072,4
74073,Bought for my son who is rather thin.,74073,4
74073,Might be tight fit for average user.,74073,4
74073,I recommend getting one size bigger.,74073,4
74073,I received the wrong color item and it was to close to Xmas to get it exchanged for the right one.,74073,4
74073,Might want to order with some lee way in case you get wrong color/fit and need to return.,74073,4
74074,Nice hat for what we needed.,74074,4
74074,Brim doesn't fold down.,74074,4
74075,"I would definitely recommend these to anyone whos looking for a comfortable, good fitting pair of yoga pants.",74075,4
74075,"I am very happy with them and I will be ordering more, they fit great to the size and also at a great price.",74075,4
74076,I bought this set for my 2 1/2 year old son.,74076,4
74076,He loves the robe!,74076,4
74076,The slippers don't stay on his feet so he hasn't worn them since the first time he tried them on.,74076,4
74076,The Robe is perfect over his pajamas on chilly mornings.,74076,4
74076,Very soft and comfortable!,74076,4
74078,"I mean I loved it, it just was tight.",74078,4
74078,I got a XL because they didn't have a 2X.,74078,4
74079,Cool mask - as expected.,74079,4
74080,"I bought this for a Halloween costume and it's perfect, and will probably be used casually as well.",74080,4
74080,"The material itself is fairly thin and sheer in areas, so keep that in mind.",74080,4
74080,There's a second layer underneath the skirt that covers well but you might need a tank top on underneath for the top.,74080,4
74080,"There are a few loose threads on the dress, but I don't see it as a problem.",74080,4
74080,The sleeves are full length and button up as seen in the stock photo.,74080,4
74080,"Super comfy- I normally wear a size large in US womens clothing and ordered that- the tag on the dress says XXL but the sticker on the packaging it came in says L, I would say it fits well (still loose and flowy with some room as it's supposed to fit).",74080,4
74080,"I'm 5'2 and it's the perfect length, comes down to about my ankles.",74080,4
74080,"Really cute affordable dress, will probably buy in another color sometime!",74080,4
74081,The bottom dangles a little but it's still cute,74081,4
74082,A bit thin though.,74082,4
74083,These Wings are really quite nice.,74083,4
74083,"However,  when I went to try them on the first time one of the straps broke that hold onto your shoulder.",74083,4
74083,It's repairable but received four stars.,74083,4
74083,I would purchase them in a different color.,74083,4
74084,"don't like the pouch for your private parts would have preferred that to not be there ,",74084,4
74087,Just worn it today and like it.,74087,4
74087,Going to get another one for working out.,74087,4
74088,"The bracelet seems nice - am giving to my granddaughter as a gift, so I hope she thinks so too.",74088,4
74088,"Had thought it might come in better packaging, maybe a box?",74088,4
74088,It was just sealed in a little Baggie.,74088,4
74089,"It is a little snug in the chest area and I'm only a C, but other than that it is very cute dress",74089,4
74090,This dress was cute as a button!,74090,4
74090,"So thrilled, can't wait for the opportunity to wear it!",74090,4
74092,"Works well to keep the ""Boys"" in place during a day long ride on my Harley.",74092,4
74093,The shirt was nice but it was way too small.,74093,4
74094,"I haven't worn this yet, so I can't give a full description of it.",74094,4
74094,"It is pretty, not quite what I expected, but nice just the same.",74094,4
74095,It is a little thinner than I thought but so soft.,74095,4
74095,Very cute and comfortable though.,74095,4
74096,"Cheap, but good enough quality to start your stretching journey.",74096,4
74097,received what I expected and I was happy.,74097,4
74099,It's s great teen dress,74099,4
74100,I really like this wallet and it's very cute-even arrived two weeks early.,74100,4
74100,It seems like a pretty good quality wallet and is a soft pleather.,74100,4
74100,Not to mention pretty big with tons of space (I used my previous wallet that I got from Hottopic as a size reference).,74100,4
74100,"Although I really like this wallet, I have two issues with it.",74100,4
74100,"The first is that the change pouch is kind of thin and papery, so if you usually have a lot of change I suggest having a separate change purse.",74100,4
74100,"The other problem I have is that when I received the wallet in the mail, there was a sticker on the front that when I peeled it off, it left a pretty big black stain on my wallet which bothered me.",74100,4
74100,"I did find out that if you use a makeup remover wipe, it'll clean the stains off of your wallet and I got most of it off, but there's still a black smudge on the bottom, which is mainly why the wallet doesn't have five stars.",74100,4
74100,Other than that I really like this wallet and I'm super glad I chose to buy it.,74100,4
74101,"This product fit as expected,  my son find it to be a very good product.",74101,4
74102,Cute dress that I bought for a costume to be Joan Holloway (from Mad Men).,74102,4
74102,"The costume turned out great, which is to say this is definitely a ""going out"" dress, not appropriate for the office.",74102,4
74102,"The draping in the front shows the seam, which was kind of annoying.",74102,4
74102,"However, you are getting a ~$25 dress for less than $15, so it is a deal.",74102,4
74102,"Also, washed/hung dry twice, it has held up.",74102,4
74103,"Well, It is has longer measures compared to the usual L size shirts, that I bought recently,  especially the sleeves, So I had to bend the sleeves over, but nothing bad at all.",74103,4
74103,Anyhow I appreciated the insert logos and also the confection.,74103,4
74103,I am quite satisfied.,74103,4
74104,"Sparkly BIG signature ring - about 1 1/8"" in diameter.",74104,4
74104,Obviously costume jewelry -fun.,74104,4
74104,"Arrived a few days ""earlier"" than expected.",74104,4
74105,Just a it looked on the web site.,74105,4
74106,I don't love it.,74106,4
74106,But I do like it.,74106,4
74107,Very colorful - Beautiful!,74107,4
74107,Arrived on time great value!,74107,4
74108,I am 5'8 around 188 pounds.,74108,4
74108,I always want to know the height and weight on reviews because it helps.,74108,4
74108,I was skeptical and I am usually in large but I ordered a medium going by the reviews and it was a perfect fit and still had room in it.,74108,4
74108,The top does kind of looks like a sports bra but the back of it has the same design the skirt has on the front.,74108,4
74110,These were a gift and they were very pretty.,74110,4
74110,The pearl is large.,74110,4
74111,"It fits, but it is a little small.",74111,4
74111,It would fit someone with a short torso great!,74111,4
74112,"Nice wallet, pretty bland for my taste.",74112,4
74112,Has plenty of pockets.,74112,4
74112,"A little heavier than my previous wallet, smells like funky plastic.",74112,4
74112,"I don't love it,  but I don't mind it either.",74112,4
74112,"Also, no one has stolen my money/identity yet, so that's a plus!",74112,4
74113,The decals are a little sketch.,74113,4
74113,Areas where it's not ironed down,74113,4
74114,Nice cover up but way too big.,74114,4
74114,I'm 4-10 and I was swimming in it,74114,4
74115,"The dress is of good quality, Unfortunately it fit tighter than I liked, so I am returning it for a refund.",74115,4
74115,"I purchased a size 16 as I did before with another one of their dresses, but this one was just too tight.",74115,4
74116,is ok..  the fabric is a bit stiff.,74116,4
74116,but will work for around the house in hot weather,74116,4
74117,A bit shinier than I expected it to be.,74117,4
74118,Darling jacket for our princess to wear during a visit to Disneyland.,74118,4
74118,The fit was perfect and the quality is nice.,74118,4
74119,Wife loved it but it was to small,74119,4
74121,the hood is somewhat large but it still looks and feels great on.,74121,4
74121,worth it for the price,74121,4
74123,Really should get if u are going for that  bubble booty look (; just honestly don't get it if u don't fee comfortable in thongs if u know what I mean :p,74123,4
74124,Wore it to the Formation Tour.,74124,4
74124,Got lots of compliments on it,74124,4
74125,"I love love love this rashguard, especially for the price.",74125,4
74125,"I love the tie sides, so that I could adjust depending on the suit I was pairing it with.",74125,4
74125,"And while this might not have been the intended use, the front zip was awesome for a breastfeeding mom like me.",74125,4
74125,I wore this almost every day in Hawaii and did not have to worry about sunscreen.,74125,4
74125,I will be getting more colors in the future.,74125,4
74126,I wore this at 34 weeks pregnant.,74126,4
74126,"I'm 5'8"", 135 pre-pregnancy, and I purchased a small.",74126,4
74126,There could definitely be more material on the top.,74126,4
74126,"If it's pulled down low enough so the waist of the dress sits correctly, it shows way too much chest.",74126,4
74126,I wore a black tank underneath and it worked fine.,74126,4
74126,"Other than that, I liked the fit a lot.",74126,4
74126,"It was fitted enough on the top/waist so I didn't look like a whale, but it wasn't fitted through the back and rear to make me feel like I was stuffed into a sausage casing.",74126,4
74126,"Maternity dresses seem to either be shapeless or fitted, and this is a happy medium.",74126,4
74129,My dress was great!,74129,4
74129,I did have to do some alterations but no biggy.,74129,4
74129,I loved it and it made my first prom even more special!,74129,4
74130,"Fun little Christmas present for our 2-year-old, who asked Santa for a ""gumbrella.""",74130,4
74130,"She's been carrying it around for weeks now, opening and closing it.",74130,4
74131,It's definitely not made for us bustier women hahaha but it still fits me fine...just tighter on the chest haha I still really like it :),74131,4
74133,This fits just a bit tight.,74133,4
74133,I am now working to slim down just a bit and it should then fit perfectly.,74133,4
74133,"It looks and feels like high quality leather, and I think I will be very happy with it once I get in a little better shape.",74133,4
74135,Heavier than I expected but still a great fit.,74135,4
74136,Its my go to bra,74136,4
74137,The fir is good for more curvaceous fugures.,74137,4
74138,"Black fit comfortably snug, perfect for exercising.",74138,4
74138,Gray is a loose and falls frequently.,74138,4
74139,This is a nicely made leather jacket.,74139,4
74139,Right out the bag it's got that new leather smell.,74139,4
74139,Seller asked for dimensions after placing order but I don't know if these are actually made to your measurements or just to see which size would fit the best.,74139,4
74139,"The quality of the leather, stitching and detail is all very nice though.",74139,4
74140,I loved the socks but they just fitted me too small.,74140,4
74142,Will its short if u are small and want the oversize looked as pictured then it's great,74142,4
74143,I LOVE THIS SWEATER!,74143,4
74143,I live in it,74143,4
74144,There was no stylus included at all!!!,74144,4
74144,One of the reasons I bought it (besides the fact that it's cute).,74144,4
74144,"Also, it didn't specify whether the card slots were protected against a magnetic pull?",74144,4
74144,I heard that if there isn't a protective barrier is can screw up your debit/credit cards so I'm a bit weary of putting important cards like that in there (which was the second reason I got a wallet phone case).,74144,4
74144,Other than that I like it.,74144,4
74144,I'm going to go check the packaging to look for the stylus again but I'm pretty positive that it wasn't included.,74144,4
74144,Neither one had it.,74144,4
74145,Beautiful and great quality!,74145,4
74146,A bit too long for me.,74146,4
74146,"Will but it off and make about 3"" shorter.",74146,4
74146,Bottoms too large for me.,74146,4
74149,WHAT U SEE IS WHAT U  GET THERE NICE,74149,4
74150,It is always hard for me too find a pair of trouser that fit right.,74150,4
74150,These do just right.,74150,4
74151,I roughed up the inside to increase its adhesion.,74151,4
74151,It holds nice an tight.,74151,4
74152,I am 5'2 so it is fine.,74152,4
74152,wouldn't order if you are over 5'2ish... unless you wish to wear as shirt.,74152,4
74152,cute pattern for fall,74152,4
74153,Great quality for the price--roomy but not overly big.,74153,4
74153,Perhaps go up a size.,74153,4
74153,They remind me of a Nike short I have.,74153,4
74153,The drawstring and ability to fold down the top are nice.,74153,4
74154,I wear a 32C and normally a 3 in pants.,74154,4
74154,I ordered a small and it was way to small on my bust and just a bit tight on my bottom.,74154,4
74154,But very cute suit,74154,4
74156,"My only complaint is that it was a lot bigger than I expected, but it's still cute.",74156,4
74157,Love love love it !,74157,4
74157,I'm 5'5 140lbs & the dress fit perfectly length wise & size wise.,74157,4
74157,A lil tight to get on there wasn't that much spandex.,74157,4
74157,The dress also isn't ass see through as the pic but other than that looks exactly like the picture.,74157,4
74157,Only downfall in my oppinion was the material was a lil thin i poked a small hole in it when trying to roll the dress down.,74157,4
74157,Overall I would rate the dress 8.5/10,74157,4
74159,like this product but it runs small,74159,4
74163,The quality and style was on point.,74163,4
74163,Just ran a size too small.,74163,4
74163,If your kid is 3t order the next size up.,74163,4
74164,"Smaller than I expected, but perfect for my tongue web piercing.",74164,4
74164,"Definitely wouldn't recommend for an eyebrow piercing because they are so small, but other than that I thought they were great.",74164,4
74164,"Came way earlier than expected, too.",74164,4
74165,"Like it, just a little to dainty for my taste.",74165,4
74166,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE COLOR & SIZE OF THIS WALLET !,74166,4
74166,THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT IS VERY SLIPPERY WHEN YOU GO TO GET IT OUT OF YOUR PURSE & THAT MAKES IT HARD TO HANDLE......,74166,4
74166,STILL NOT SURE IF I AM KEEPING IT OR NOT !,74166,4
74167,"Great price, but not as much tummy control as I would like",74167,4
74169,"I compliment this dress  for its style, I really like it.",74169,4
74169,"The flower on the chest, sleeves and the bottom part of the dress and how its beautifully laid out makes the dress look very elegant yet simple that you can wear it anytime.",74169,4
74169,"You can wear it with flat shoes/sandal to go to the mall, or even grocery shopping or wear it with heels for for an evening occasion and it will definitely fit it.",74169,4
74169,"However, my big wish is the length of the dress, size wise perfectly fit on every part (Im a 5'0 90 lbs  asian petite woman).",74169,4
74169,"Im always a small in size, its like in everything but this dress is way too short for me.",74169,4
74169,"I wish it was a little longer coz I love this dress but I cant wear it  without having something for the bottom coz if its worn as a dress it will show your ass, not very ladylike as the dress would have been supposed to be.",74169,4
74170,I purchased these as a grift for a family member just for fun and he really likes them.,74170,4
74170,Says the Superman ones make his feet want to fly!,74170,4
74171,a little cheap- makes a clinky sound,74171,4
74173,Much shorter in the front than pictured but still works very well.,74173,4
74175,Perfect for Mardi Gras.,74175,4
74175,The tutu is a long compared to others which has its positives and negatives.,74175,4
74175,The waist has a lot of elastic; I'm 5'4 124 and it fit snug.,74175,4
74175,"The frills tended to be quite ""static-y"" at times, but not a big deal!",74175,4
74177,I read the other reviews and decided to buy a size up...,74177,4
74177,I can wear a medium (even though mediums are sometimes tight because of my postpartum weight)... so I didn't wanna take a chance - I bought the large.,74177,4
74177,It fits nicely... hugs my curves.,74177,4
74177,Not too tight but not baggy either.,74177,4
74177,"The length is long... like, really long.",74177,4
74177,"However, I'm pretty short, so mostly everything I wear is way too long for me.",74177,4
74177,"My only complaint (albeit, a small one) is that it came out of the package wrinkly... and because of the material, I'm afraid to melt it with an iron...",74177,4
74177,"The package doesn't even list what kind of material it is..The beige skirt part isn't wrinkly... just the brown part, and it's noticeable :( Looks like wrinkled satin-leather.. kinda weird.. but it's not awful.",74177,4
74177,Still a cool looking costume.,74177,4
74178,Fits perfect and feels really good.,74178,4
74178,I like the look and received many compliments on it.,74178,4
74179,"its a bit long, but overall wonderful colors and flow.",74179,4
74179,looks like water when I walk.,74179,4
74181,love the sweater----stitching is loose and needs to be reinforced,74181,4
74182,Its comfortable but the size that should have fit is a couple inches to short,74182,4
74183,"This was a little large, I'm a 16 and got XL, I would have been ok in a L.  This actually is a good thing because it makes me feel good to not order the largest item.",74183,4
74183,"It does say One Piece Bathing Suit and maybe that's all I read because when I got it, it's ONLY the top!!",74183,4
74183,I guess here it does say Tankini... but I've never bought a tankini before.,74183,4
74183,"Bottom line, it's beautiful and I love it, looks just like the picture and I like that the 2 blue straps go over my arms so it's a secure fit, then the stripes go behind your neck and you can tie a bow.",74183,4
74183,I'm on my way to buy a white bottom so I can rock this in Vegas!!,74183,4
74185,"these are a hit with the kids, but the elastic did pull out of one of them fairly easily.",74185,4
74187,No stripped our broken pieces.,74187,4
74187,"No repeats, there are some in the same design but different colors, including one glow in the dark :-D
My only complaint was the count, there is only 93 in the bag I received instead of 100 but this is still a great deal!!",74187,4
74188,I like it very nice,74188,4
74189,Order a size larger and still a little small.,74189,4
74189,I do like it.,74189,4
74190,"Well made, great price.",74190,4
74191,Great price for what was included!,74191,4
74191,I use the larger bag to carry my books and the next size down to carry my personal effects.,74191,4
74191,"What makes it great is if I need something smaller for a night out, I can.",74191,4
74193,I love these flip flops but Amazon service was terrible here.,74193,4
74193,Twice I ordered the flip flops and twice Amazon sent me a completely different size.,74193,4
74193,I'll still put a 4 since I have a pair of these flip flops I bought elsewhere and I love them.,74193,4
74193,They are not fancy but they're comfortable and work for the beach and casual days.,74193,4
74194,"When I saw the tiny package this came in , I was very disappointed.",74194,4
74194,The dress I was expecting would not fit in such a tiny package.,74194,4
74194,Upon opening it I discovered that the dress is NOT cotton: It's thin and satiny like a skirt liner.,74194,4
74194,"The digital print isn't perfect, but It's just fine.",74194,4
74194,Upon trying it on I discovered that the fit was pretty nice and that the material wasn't visibly see-through as I was afraid it would be.,74194,4
74194,I didn't even bother opening the belt.,74194,4
74194,"The construction of the dress is cheap and odd, but the zipper is well-hidden.",74194,4
74194,"All in all it's a cheap, comfortable dress that got a lot of compliments today.",74194,4
74194,"For sizing info, I am 5'2"" and 133lbs and the medium fit me well.",74194,4
74195,"Dress is amazing, I wore it to a pool party and was the talk of the party.",74195,4
74195,I'm usually a XL but the L fit great I actually could have got a medium .,74195,4
74195,"I'm also very tall 5' 9"" so I was worried about the length the length was perfect.",74195,4
74195,I wore it with flats so it barely touched the floor.,74195,4
74195,Lately the material was great quality !,74195,4
74196,"Haven't worn this yet, only tried it on.",74196,4
74196,I love the way it fit.,74196,4
74196,"I'm 5'2"", 140 lbs, so usually things that fit me are too long.",74196,4
74196,"This was perfect, right at knee length and right at wrist length.",74196,4
74196,It's refreshing to not have to alter a suit after purchasing it!,74196,4
74196,"Definitely recommend to anyone needing a nice, clean, suit.",74196,4
74196,"SIDE NOTE: I don't recall whether it said in the description or not, but this suit is dry clean only!",74196,4
74196,I didn't notice before I purchased it so I wanted to give you a heads up in case that is an issue for anyone.,74196,4
74197,"This was a birthday gift for a 9-year-old, and she loved it!",74197,4
74197,"Not sure how sturdy it'll prove to be, and it was a little bit larger than I thought it would be, but it's really pretty.",74197,4
74198,I appreciate the number and size of zippered pockets.,74198,4
74198,"However, possibly because the purse was folded and rolled for packaging, the zippers were sticking easily due to puckers.",74198,4
74198,"I finally got them all closed and pressed each one closed, and they now function, but do not open or close smoothly yet.",74198,4
74198,I'm hoping this improves in time & with use.,74198,4
74198,"I really like the strap, too.",74198,4
74198,Easy to change the length from shoulder bag to cross-body bag.,74198,4
74201,It is overall great quality but the sizing was off.,74201,4
74201,I have 2 small boys (ages 4 and 2).,74201,4
74201,The 4 yr old is 35 pounds and the 2 yr old is 20 pounds.,74201,4
74201,"The size 4 fits my 2 yr old with some room to grow, but it on the smaller side with my 4 yr old.",74201,4
74201,I will be buying again from this seller.,74201,4
74202,The material is great.,74202,4
74202,Overall it is well made.,74202,4
74202,The hood is a little heavy but it is removable.,74202,4
74202,I feel like it is cut a little bit narrow through shoulders/arms.,74202,4
74203,4 stars is for the great customer service!,74203,4
74203,Material is light and feels great.,74203,4
74203,You can see the loose stitching at the V-neck cheapening the look.,74203,4
74203,I LOVE the color and the material is comfortable when just standing in one place.,74203,4
74203,The slit rides up and out way too much.,74203,4
74203,I am not comfortable wearing it for that reason only.,74203,4
74203,The company saw my review and offered a refund.,74203,4
74203,I was shocked that they reached out to me and I gladly accepted.,74203,4
74205,My kids love these shoes.,74205,4
74205,It is his third pair.,74205,4
74206,"Antlers don't stick up as hoped, but very comfortable and great price!",74206,4
74207,"Shoes ended up being slightly big, but with thick socks they work great.",74207,4
74208,"Have to put a liner inside, no adjustment in the inside band.",74208,4
74208,I like the hat it doesn't look cheap.,74208,4
74210,Wish the back pin latch was reversed so you would push down when placing it on clothing.,74210,4
74211,Exactly what I expected,74211,4
74212,nice but to long have to take it up to long for me,74212,4
74213,Chokers were good quality for the price.,74213,4
74213,"Shipping took about a month, but I wasn't necessarily in a rush to get them.",74213,4
74214,"I loved this, but it was too big on me.",74214,4
74214,Felt really good when I tried it on.,74214,4
74214,The seller accepted my return and gave me my money back fast so thanks!,74214,4
74215,Material is thin (which is nice for the summer) and colors not as vibrant after initial wash.,74215,4
74215,"But still super cute, fits well.",74215,4
74215,My 3-year old is average size and got the 4 for her.,74215,4
74215,"She liked the dress and was comfortable in it, while still leaving room to grow.",74215,4
74216,I returned it do to the size .It was great quality just not a big as I like.,74216,4
74217,I'm 5 ft and ordered a small but it's still too long.,74217,4
74217,Slightly see through so careful on your underwear choice.,74217,4
74217,Nice overall and can't beat the price of $25!,74217,4
74220,Looks great and it's very light weight,74220,4
74221,Nice clutch but really long.,74221,4
74221,The chain is somewhat bothersome.,74221,4
74222,These leggings are very helpful since i have a big varicose vein on my upper thigh.,74222,4
74222,The only reason its 4 stars is cause its a hassle putting them on!,74222,4
74222,Lol they are soo tight but thats what they are for,74222,4
74223,The leather is beautiful.,74223,4
74223,The thing I like the least is the clasp.,74223,4
74223,"Its relatively gaudy, unnecessarily oversized.",74223,4
74224,A bit big but I am a cross dresser and my boobs are large so it holds them up.,74224,4
74224,Wish it was tighter though.,74224,4
74224,I need to order a slightly smaller size.,74224,4
74225,Looks just like Trumps.,74225,4
74225,It starts a lot of conversations.,74225,4
74226,"Pretty light weight, I thought it would be a little heavier.",74226,4
74226,Will work well when just a light jacket or sweater is needed.,74226,4
74226,Looks good with jeans.,74226,4
74227,"It fits very well, and I like the way it looks.",74227,4
74228,Whenever I wear this necklace I get a lot of compliments.,74228,4
74228,"Great value, as it looks more expensive than it actually is..",74228,4
74230,"Nice dress good material, the color is a lot more pink than I expected",74230,4
74231,"1same for all 3 dresses, should order  1 size up if blessed in the butt & hip area",74231,4
74232,Looks beautiful but runs small,74232,4
74233,This is an awesome shirt.,74233,4
74233,My husband liked it.,74233,4
74233,Runs a little small,74233,4
74234,"Other than the size, I am very well happy with it.",74234,4
74236,My husband lovessels them!,74236,4
74237,"Nice sunglasses, awesome fit perfect",74237,4
74239,First of all the package came in time and was well packed!,74239,4
74239,I got what I ordered and the art socks are looking great!,74239,4
74239,"I got these socks for my friend, she is in art major so I am sure she will enjoy them !",74239,4
74239,"I give 4 stars only because I think the shiping price is high, I paid $7, but other than that the socks are great!",74239,4
74240,The shirt looked great !,74240,4
74241,"This is a nice belt, but the XL size was too long for me.",74241,4
74241,"I normally wear a 36 belt, but sometimes a 36 is too small depending on the manufacturer.",74241,4
74241,"Since the range for size 36 was right in the middle of Large and X-Large, I tried the XL.",74241,4
74241,Too big by a lot!,74241,4
74241,(In some ways I was relieved!),74241,4
74241,The leather itself is very soft and flexible which I don't think is a plus for a belt.,74241,4
74241,"The grain and finish of the belt look great, however, so no stars off for that.",74241,4
74241,"The backside of the belt is rough, unfinished leather, which makes it more difficult to put on and take off.",74241,4
74241,"I'm also not a big fan of the buckle itself, which is wrapped in leather at the back where it acts as a belt loop.",74241,4
74241,The extra thickness makes the buckle protrude slightly on one side when the belt is worn.,74241,4
74241,It looks a little sloppy to me.,74241,4
74241,"This is a nice quality belt especially considering the cost, but size aside, I would not buy another one.",74241,4
74242,I like the product.,74242,4
74242,It seems to work very well BUT will it last?,74242,4
74242,The device has charged all of my solar watches in a timely fashion.,74242,4
74242,It does warm the watches a little bit but a lot less than I had expected.,74242,4
74242,The main question and the reason I only gave it 4 stars is that I do not know if the unit will last or die a quick death.,74242,4
74242,"If the seller had waited a bit longer I might have been able to give them a 5 star review but as they requested that I review them now, only 4 stars because of the unknown.",74242,4
74243,"It looks great in the picture and great on you for a few weeks to months (depending on use); however, after several uses, the inside wire starts bending inward on the ends like a paperclip, causing the wire to become shorter than the ribbon.",74243,4
74243,"Thus, the ends go limp and look floppy.",74243,4
74243,"Because the wire is inside, it is difficult to re-straighten the wire.",74243,4
74243,"Other than that, it's a lovely accessory; I would purchase again.",74243,4
74243,You do get what you pay for (:,74243,4
74244,It is just like the picture.,74244,4
74244,I gave it only four stars because the white is see through.,74244,4
74244,I still really like it and will use it for a cover up at the beach or lake.,74244,4
74245,It's kinda longer than i expected but that's okay,74245,4
74246,"A little larger than I wanted, but I find it still looks great.",74246,4
74247,Clasp is weak but the bracelet is beautiful.,74247,4
74248,One leg is larger than the other which is weird to put on.,74248,4
74248,There is no elastic in the holes for the legs so it makes it sort of painful to wear for extended periods of time.,74248,4
74248,Great in the waist though.,74248,4
74248,These look exactly like the shorts worn in Suicide Squad so they will look amazing in pictures!,74248,4
74249,These are comfortable and I love the color.,74249,4
74249,"I did not get them to wear during hot yoga - just got them for running around, lounge type bottoms.",74249,4
74249,I walked the dogs in them today and WHEW - they are HOT.,74249,4
74249,"I can't imagine wearing them for hot yoga, I'd probably end up completely overheating.",74249,4
74249,Good wearables for errands or hanging around the house and a good price.,74249,4
74250,I really liked the style of this dress unfortunately  it was way to small.,74250,4
74250,"Sadly, I had to return the dress.",74250,4
74251,great  blouse  a little  see thru but easy to fix with an under tandtop,74251,4
74252,Does what it's supposed and is pretty comfortable,74252,4
74253,"Slightly flimsy, but overall a really cute, dainty adjustable ring.",74253,4
74253,I would buy it again.,74253,4
74254,Nice belt but wish it were a little bit narrower to better fit thru belt loops on pants.,74254,4
74255,"- nice looking belt and buckle but it doesn't fit my 36"" pants, buy it long!....two stars....
- pleased that company was responsive to my concerns, raised to four stars....",74255,4
74256,Love Love Love them!,74256,4
74256,ordered the red for my son and the pink ones for my daughter!,74256,4
74256,"the only problem I have is that the pink ones came bent,put a sock in them though seem to fix the problem,but either then that great buy!",74256,4
74256,Kids are going to be soo happy on Christmas Day.,74256,4
74257,I don't nessecarily like the fabric it makes you hot and it sticks to you and itches but it's very cute and stylish,74257,4
74258,I ordered this is a large and had to reorder in a medium.,74258,4
74258,It is a cute dress.,74258,4
74258,good quality and comfortable.,74258,4
74259,"Length was fine, but much more baggy than the way I would expect a base layer to fit.",74259,4
74261,"Great fit, excellent buy.",74261,4
74261,"The straps int he back started detaching, and I've only worn this 4-5 times.",74261,4
74261,"It's cheap, but you'll get your $'s worth, and hopefully a bit more!",74261,4
74262,"Once I saw how well these fit, I ordered three more.",74262,4
74262,Wish they had more colors so I could order even more.,74262,4
74262,"The blue and the black are fine, but the pink and green are very washed out and look old and worn.",74262,4
74262,I want subtle colors -- not neon -- but I don't want want the washed-out look.,74262,4
74263,"The hat is just as pictured except there was no label inside...there was, however, about 3 inches of stitching near the rim of the hat.",74263,4
74263,It was loose and I was able to get it off.,74263,4
74263,"Otherwise, a good purchase.",74263,4
74264,It fits perfectly but the problem with the zipper I could not zipper it when it was on .,74264,4
74264,"when I took it off I could zipper it , but the zipper still gets stuck at the halfway point it's so beautiful fits true to size",74264,4
74265,"No issues with anything, and this bracelet is cute!",74265,4
74266,Nice solution for flabby arms and short sleeves...looks good,74266,4
74267,"Cute, but somewhat small.",74267,4
74267,But my son loves them regardless.,74267,4
74268,"Bought this for an ugly T-shirt contest, but it was too cute and didn't even get one 'ugly' vote!",74268,4
74269,I really like the design of this shirt.. it's comfortable but not the most comfortable.,74269,4
74269,It's durable and goes with jeans very nicely.,74269,4
74270,Not as slouchy as it looks.,74270,4
74270,"I have a small head, but it only has a tiny little awkward slouch at the back.",74270,4
74270,"Kind of disappointed, but it is warm and the color is beautiful, so I'm keeping it.",74270,4
74271,Works great as a vest with a Pirate shirt.,74271,4
74272,"I would LOVE this shirt if it was made of cotton, but, it's amazing design had me sold on it.",74272,4
74272,I'm slim so it was a little baggy and I ordered a small.,74272,4
74272,Please come out with Victor!,74272,4
74273,"I won't be using these daily like I had planned, perhaps only for sunnies.",74273,4
74275,I LOOK FARWARD WEARING IT TO SEE IF THE COLOR WILL NOT CHANGE.,74275,4
74276,Nice color great fit and great price.,74276,4
74277,These sunglasses were for my son and he wears them regularly.,74277,4
74278,This top is super cute!,74278,4
74278,I paired it with a sequin tank and it looked great.,74278,4
74278,"My only complaint is I wish the sleeves were longer, it hits at an awkward spot so I have to push them up.",74278,4
74278,I do love it tho!,74278,4
74279,The pants fit appropriately.,74279,4
74279,I did not have the issue that most had with size.,74279,4
74279,"I am 5'3, 120 ordered a small and they fit well.",74279,4
74280,So cute and well made.,74280,4
74280,It is very small.,74280,4
74280,"A wallet, keys, phone and glasses make it stuffed.",74280,4
74280,It will barely zip.,74280,4
74280,I need more space than us offered w/this purse.,74280,4
74281,My boyfriend loved this,74281,4
74282,This is very small and the material has no stretch whatsoever.,74282,4
74282,I had hoped it would just be a little too small but it was at least 5 sizes too small for me.,74282,4
74282,"I gave it to an 11 year old who wears a double zero in jeans and it fit her fine, it was just a little bit short.",74282,4
74282,She loved the bright neon pink color.,74282,4
74282,It is lined and the inside is like a white mesh.,74282,4
74282,The outside fabric is has no stretch or give to it at all.,74282,4
74282,It is spaghetti strapped and it had a cute little design tied into the back at the top.,74282,4
74282,It looked almost like macrame.,74282,4
74282,It was made into the racerback design of the dress.,74282,4
74282,I wish it had fit but unfortunately it did not and there is no size large enough to fit me.,74282,4
74282,They are definitely Asian sizes and on the much smaller end of the size spectrum.,74282,4
74282,I removed on star for the size chart being posted nowhere before I ordered.,74282,4
74282,I received a discount on this dress in exchange for my honest opinion and review of the product.,74282,4
74282,I hope you have found my review helpful.,74282,4
74283,It fits very nice but one of my buttons came off,74283,4
74284,"I am normally a size 2 or xsmall,the small top isa little but loose the bottom fits perfectly, it looks exactly as it did in the photo, and the quality is great.",74284,4
74285,It is a pretty piece but does not sit centered as shown in the picture.,74285,4
74285,This will vary depending on your piercer.,74285,4
74286,I Line the colors the fabric is good the only bad thing I foun was the size I am use to purchase a size up to my regular size.,74286,4
74286,"I found the size up was a bit tight for my taste, I will order a size up next time",74286,4
74287,Bought them for my son's 2nd birthday.,74287,4
74287,They fit him well and he wears them all the time.,74287,4
74287,The light is very bright so you always see him coming and I don't mind that at all.,74287,4
74287,Heven has been wearing them for about two months now and they are holding up well.,74287,4
74288,It looks nice but it's a little tight I'm 5'2 180lbs and ordered an XL I love the way it looks on me but it's a little tiny struggle to take off the top part,74288,4
74289,"very sexy dress, super thin fitted but hubby loves it!",74289,4
74290,less pot leaves would be great but everything else very happy,74290,4

74293,Look just like the picture.,74293,4
74293,I have received so many compliments.,74293,4
74293,The Only problem one of the stones came out that's why I didn't give it a five star but can be fixed with glue.,74293,4
74294,Thin fabric but pretty colors.,74294,4
74295,I couldn't close it (size 14) but didn't need to.,74295,4

74296,Bought these for my 2 year old but they are way to big for her still.,74296,4
74297,Love the idea of this product.,74297,4
74297,They are great for sunny stroller rides when you don't want to have to put both sides of the canopy up and cover baby's view.,74297,4
74297,Beware if your baby has chubby thighs--they will run small in that region.,74297,4
74297,"My baby's thighs are beginning to become thicker now (though not chubby), and they are becoming more difficult to pull up.",74297,4
74299,I only wish the design on the top of dress was made of glass stones.,74299,4
74302,"Bought this for my wife for christmas, the apron is small which is fine but the undies they come with are HUGE yall r gonna get me beat up but it might be funny we'll see......",74302,4
74303,Wish they were big enough but they were not.,74303,4
74304,"These were a little smaller than expected, but still super cute and will fit my 15 month old for a short while!",74304,4
74305,The shirt was nice enough and the perfect thickness (thinness) for wearing under a vest and suit jacket without becoming overheated.,74305,4
74305,"I was less impressed with the design on the tie, but it'll do.",74305,4
74306,I really love this dress!!!,74306,4

74309,"Cotton 100%, nice t shirt",74309,4
74310,"Exactly what you'd expect, looks pretty, but obviously not authentic looking.",74310,4
74310,Not bad for the price!,74310,4
74311,"Very pretty, but had to return because could not fit iphone 6.",74311,4
74312,Some good some not so good,74312,4
74313,Cute suit-lined as well.,74313,4
74313,"I ordered a large (option S, M, L), bottom fits however top (with inserts or without) is a B cup- too bad it runs small as I'm a size 10, this is more an 8 or 9; I'll just have to loses a few :-)",74313,4
74315,2 year-old loves them.,74315,4
74317,Not a full 'Stand Collar' or band collar.,74317,4
74317,"Nice shirt, well-fitted for most part, but has a small gap in the front above the linking button (there's a divide, at front, where many band collars fold together or dip, as Pandit Nehru's famous suit--the one he wore to declare India's independence in 1947.",74317,4
74317,"Whatever--not a dip, here--small gap.",74317,4
74317,"Nothing horrible, and the collar stays up well).",74317,4
74317,Well made athletically-cut shirt.,74317,4
74318,I bought these for my cat costume for Halloween this year.,74318,4
74318,I can gladly say they arrived and looked as expected.,74318,4
74318,Size wise they are a pretty small but fits perfectly on your wrist.,74318,4
74318,I will defiantly be rocking these cuffs in the winter time.,74318,4
74319,Quality was there ...and really pretty with the jewellery on the back side ...,74319,4
74321,"This case is really cute, especially for the price.",74321,4
74321,"It's definitely not a protective case, but I wasn't expecting that.",74321,4
74321,"I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 because within two hours of opening it, it started developing an air bubble.",74321,4
74321,It has continued to get larger since yesterday which is a bummer.,74321,4
74322,Very satisfied with this product.,74322,4
74322,"Same as the ones in sunglass hut that I lost 2 years ago, only half the price.",74322,4
74323,Looks nice when I wear it,74323,4
74324,One of the anchors was a little bent however the cufflinks were solid in holding the cuffs of my shirt in place.,74324,4
74324,"They are not noisy and not too subtle, they're just right in terms of drawing attention.",74324,4
74325,"Good value, size is a little on the small size for one size fits all product.",74325,4
74326,It's wonderful and very pretty and vibrant but it's very thin and is still beautiful I would suggest this,74326,4
74328,I received this item within the promised shipping time and that is a plus.,74328,4
74328,I ordered a medium which is usually the size that I ordered for everything and it fit it perfectly.,74328,4
74328,"The material is pretty nice and soft, so I like it.",74328,4
74328,The one thing that i do not like about this dress is the lenght.,74328,4
74328,This dress is too short!,74328,4
74328,From the picture I was expecting this dress to be a little bit longer....l personally did not want a dress this short but I will keep it to wear it around the house and to go to the swimming pool when it get a little warmer.,74328,4
74328,The colors of the dress are beautiful just like in the picture and the dress still perfect after I washed it.,74328,4
74328,"If you are looking for a cute short dress, this one will definitely do it.",74328,4
74328,The dress looks great with my cowboys boots but I am sure it can be wore with different items as well.,74328,4
74330,Fit perfectly in my shoes without trimming.,74330,4
74331,I do really like this I would probably buy more colors even though after wearing it once one of the loops broke so I cant wear the belt with it.,74331,4
74332,The dress is well made and the quality is good.,74332,4
74332,The colors are different than what is shown in the picture.,74332,4
74332,That was a bit disappointing.,74332,4
74332,But overall good dress/swim suit cover up,74332,4
74333,"need XL for shoulders, it is ok, still a little tight",74333,4
74334,Soft and very pretty,74334,4
74335,"Followed the instruction on the size measurements, and the shirt fit GREAT!",74335,4
74336,"These are good, non-glare and the side bars do not catch your hair.",74336,4
74338,I like them... a little big for my son who is 19mo but he will grow into them.,74338,4
74339,Compartment zippers section seems a little small for my big hands but I have received many compliments on the style.,74339,4
74340,I couldn't wait to get this I'm the mail and for a good price.,74340,4
74340,I was a bit disappointed because t isn't black and white it's more of an off white/pale stained yellow and white.,74340,4
74340,I'm not sure what to wear with it now.,74340,4
74340,and the elbow patches are not on my elbows.,74340,4
74341,I am glad I ordered this jacket.,74341,4
74341,It is a pretty color (hot pink).,74341,4
74341,Arrived quickly but quite wrinkled.,74341,4
74341,"I am a size 8-10, usually a M, but  I ordered the large and it fits well.",74341,4
74341,It actually says US size 10 on the label.,74341,4
74342,"Fits like a glove, I like the silk feeling",74342,4
74343,Nice but very short.,74343,4
74344,I haven't worn it yet but I think it will be awesome when I travel.,74344,4
74345,"I love this sweatshirt, but it's a bit shorter in length than I would like.",74345,4
74346,This was the first clicker I've ever gotten.,74346,4
74346,Understandably it was difficult to adjust to putting it in.,74346,4
74346,I had to cram my fingers into my nose to hold the hinge bar in place.,74346,4
74346,It was mildly uncomfortable trying to get it to click in place and likewise trying to unlatch it.,74346,4
74346,Once in I had no problems with it.,74346,4
74346,If only work would allow me to openly display mine it wouldn't be a problem.,74346,4
74346,Otherwise it's great and gets lots of compliments.,74346,4
74346,It's a nice piece of bling and apparently the whole thing (post and decorative fan) is surgical steel as it hasn't changed colors or irritated my skin.,74346,4
74346,So I can look past the hassle of putting it in/taking it out.,74346,4
74346,I just need to give myself time to fight with it.,74346,4
74347,Of course it looks a bit cheap but it's not as bad as I expected.,74347,4
74347,Love the size and the strap that comes along.,74347,4
74347,Fantastic for the price I paid (I had amazon points yay!),74347,4
74348,"They fit well, but the sole is a bit slippery.",74348,4
74348,The last pair I bought had an anti skid pad at on the sole.,74348,4
74349,These are fine for my five year old son but I would not buy these for truly competitive soccer.,74349,4
74350,Thin material shows underclothing lines,74350,4
74351,The size is great but it's a little short.,74351,4
74351,"To be fair, I'm 6'4"" tall so it's understandable that it would be a little short but it's a Large so I expected it to fit me like other larges.",74351,4
74351,Overall I'm happy with it.,74351,4
74351,If it weren't so short on me I'd give it 5 stars.,74351,4
74353,I love it but it was too big.,74353,4
74353,I will order a size down again.,74353,4
74354,"Other than a few loose threads here and there, this is a quality vest.",74354,4
74354,"I found the fabric to have a surprisingly nice feel to it, and it's just the right amount of thickness, not thin like cheap costume vests.",74354,4
74354,"The subtle pattern makes the vest a very complex and versatile piece of any dapper man's wardrobe, and I have found it to be one that I reach for often.",74354,4
74354,"I will note that these vests seem to target more of a slender frame, so if you have a large stomach you may want to order up a couple sizes and look to a tailor to bring it in where needed.",74354,4
74354,"For reference, I am 5'6' at 135 lbs, and I ordered the xxs, which fits like a glove.",74354,4
74355,"Love it, it hasn't turn my wrist any color, very simplify style",74355,4
74356,Would prefer a cotton blend so that it would require less ironing.,74356,4
74357,"It is a little lighter weight than I was expecting, but  that was the fault of my expectation not the retailer",74357,4
74358,I was a little disappointed that the colors and pattern were a little off from what is depicted BUT the dress was still just as beautiful.,74358,4
74358,I'm 5'5 and wear a size 4.,74358,4
74358,I bought a large and it fit perfectly (probably could have gotten away with the medium too though).,74358,4
74359,For the cost it worked.,74359,4
74359,"I did not like the ears, they are close together and do not remind me of cat ears",74359,4
74361,I'm very pleased with this product.,74361,4
74361,It fits in a backpack which is extremely convenient when travelling.,74361,4
74362,"Fit as expected, a little on the small side but not too bad.",74362,4
74362,The lace up thing is hard to figure out since you have to lace up the back yourself but once I figured it out it looked cool.,74362,4
74364,Exactly what I expected.,74364,4
74366,The size chart is accurate.,74366,4
74366,Follow the bust waist and hip guide.,74366,4
74366,It's a bit long but looks awesome with heels.,74366,4
74366,"Personally though, I have a longer torso so it fits a bit too snug at the crotch.",74366,4
74368,This is my 2nd purchase.,74368,4
74368,I lost my original bracelet while on a trip.,74368,4
74368,I missed wearing it so much I ordered a replacement.,74368,4
74370,I could have order a xl but I was not sure so i ordered xxl it was little big but overall very nice shirt,74370,4
74371,"Nice tank, but missing a wow factor.",74371,4
74372,This came a week before expected but still took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive.,74372,4
74372,This is  thin and has no support for your girls and there are a few loose stitches I was really excited to get this but it fits kind of odd.,74372,4
74372,If you look from the sides you can almost see my nips but this is still so cute I don't know if it's worth $13.59 yet.,74372,4
74372,Also the design is kind of off but doesn't really bother me overall very excited to wear it since I've been watching this item for a while now  I'm a 32b and got a small for reference.,74372,4
74373,Heavy and good quality!,74373,4
74373,Picture shows him like he is.,74373,4
74374,"Great ,snug in all the right places
Makes my butt look even better",74374,4
74375,Was exactly as it looks.,74375,4
74376,Too large BUT I bought them large so the legs wouldn't be so tight.,74376,4
74376,Well made but I doubt they are worth $70.!,74376,4
74376,The denim is great.,74376,4
74376,I returned them for a smaller size.,74376,4
74377,"Love the locket, and coloring of it.",74377,4
74377,"The chain is just ok, but as expected for the price.",74377,4
74377,"This chain is LONG, so pendent will hang below neckline.",74377,4
74378,We used this hat all summer long.,74378,4
74378,"I love the coverage in the back, but I wish the front brim would stay up better.",74378,4
74378,"We often had to curl it up so my daughter could see, which defeats the purpose of having shade for her face.",74378,4
74379,Shorter than expected but over all I like it,74379,4
74381,"Good, heavy-quality leather band but be warned: New pins are NOT included for some reason.",74381,4
74381,"I've bought several replacement Wenger watch bands over the years, and this one is the first I've ever gotten that did not include new pins -- so save your existing ones when you remove your old band -- unless you have spares.",74381,4
74382,"Looks like a more expensive, quality ring.",74382,4
74382,I have received many compliments on it.,74382,4
74383,Must be dry cleaned.,74383,4
74383,"This combo of fabrics will not make it thru regularly laundry,.",74383,4
74383,I hesitate to even hand wash it.,74383,4
74383,Love the way it drapes and fits and it looks great.,74383,4
74384,Its solid some what cheap quality but the lights are very bright and vivid.,74384,4
74384,My nephew wore this in the rain for about 30 seconds and 1 of the shoes died out.,74384,4
74384,Had to order a new one after so if your caught outside in the rain for even a bit expect them to die.,74384,4
74385,Thought they would be all wood frames and there not!,74385,4
74386,"Is NOT a ladies tapered fit, even though it says womens.",74386,4
74387,I liked them my only disappointment is that they are all connected as one.,74387,4
74387,I think that it is why I didn't give 5 stars I have very small wrist and they slide right off and if I could  tie then individually I can get rid of my problem but nothing lost gave them to my daughter who  loved them,74387,4
74388,"The fit was fine - it just wasn't as flattering on ""curves"" as I hoped it would be.",74388,4
74389,Should offer x-large size,74389,4
74390,Clasp is a little iffy,74390,4
74392,"Great belly band, and works perfectly -- but a seam started coming undone just a few weeks after I got it.",74392,4
74392,Now it's past the return window.,74392,4
74394,These are really adorable gloves.,74394,4
74394,I love the colors and so does my son (and he has plenty to choose from.),74394,4
74394,"Sadly, though the thumbs BARELY fit his little ""just turned 3 year old"" thumbs.",74394,4
74394,He wore them once.,74394,4
74395,Bigger than i thought it would be!,74395,4
74396,It's very good quality for the price.,74396,4
74397,"This is a terrific, fun and sensible product.",74397,4
74397,I have several and have gifted several.,74397,4
74397,"However, they need to provide a medium size for women in all the designs.",74397,4
74397,"For many of us, the ""frumpy"" designs that are offered for women are not appealing.",74397,4
74397,"I gift to my sports fishing sons, and I wear mine for top down vintage muscle car driving.",74397,4
74397,"Buff should realize that their product has great potential in the car clubs, and many of the members are women.",74397,4
74397,We don't want pink paisley.,74397,4
74397,"We want stars and strips and Shelby Cobra and Ferrari, etc

Wet the buff down and wear it in the hot sun.",74397,4
74397,It's your own personal swamp cooler.,74397,4
74398,"Very cute and well made but does fit small, so order a size larger.",74398,4
74399,Nice bracelet but doesn't fit tight enough to keep it from turning on your arm.,74399,4

74400,The bottoms fit great.,74400,4
74400,I am 5'9 230lbs and I bought a size up from my normal size.,74400,4

74404,"Not great quality, but nice with boots in the warmer months.",74404,4
74405,Very nice color and quality.,74405,4
74405,Just runs a little small.,74405,4
74406,Got this for a beach vacation and our son seemed to tolerate it enough.,74406,4
74406,"He hates wearing hats so of course he tried to pull it off, but was not successful in doing so.",74406,4
74406,"He was 15 months old at the time and we will probably use this in the future since the adjustable cord in the back allows the hat to grow with their age, which I like.",74406,4
74407,The pink is a little more muted in person than the picture shows.,74407,4
74407,It does not ruffle at all in the front like the picture shows.,74407,4
74407,"It fits me great but its form fitting and so with my ""mommy tummy"" i look a wee bit pregnant .. which sucks but is more my problem than the shirts!",74407,4
74408,"Nice and thick, looks just like it's shown in the picture.",74408,4
74408,"Love the color, and it's super comfy.",74408,4

74410,wish they had this in another color!,74410,4
74410,"fabric is nice and flow, i feel super great in it and totally worth the buy!",74410,4
74412,These pants are ridiculously comfortable.,74412,4
74412,I usually wear a size 14/16 and find that the waist is just right on them.,74412,4
74412,"I'm only 5'4"" so I also really love that the legs of the pants have the elastic.",74412,4
74412,They aren't see through at all either.,74412,4
74412,These are great for hot days and look great with a lot of summer camis and tank tops.,74412,4
74412,I highly recommend these if you're going for that summer boho look.,74412,4
74412,I'll definitely be buying more in the future!,74412,4
74413,The item looks smart for my boy... but having the fear that he my outgrow it in a few months.,74413,4
74413,Perhaps size adjustment for future ones.,74413,4
74414,"Cute, comfortable and lightweight.",74414,4
74414,Will need a camisole underneath it to not be too revealing.,74414,4
74414,Love the color and length.,74414,4
74415,It's super cute and comfortable!!,74415,4
74415,I ordered grey but got a cream colored but still cute :),74415,4
74416,Zipper gets stuck at times though.,74416,4
74417,Product exactly as described.,74417,4
74417,Seems well made and durable.,74417,4
74418,This IS a super cute head band,74418,4
74420,The fit was fine.,74420,4
74420,I thought the sock part would have been thicker material than it is.,74420,4
74420,That was a disappointment.,74420,4
74420,The colors are great!,74420,4
74420,These are more suited for a pool not so much the beach.,74420,4
74421,Very pretty took forever to get but was worth it,74421,4
74422,"This is listed as a choker with a 13 inch chain, but the chain is more like 18 inches.",74422,4
74422,It's also not adjustable.,74422,4
74422,"To wear this necklace, I have to knot the chain in the back and hide it with my hair, which was impossible when I had a pixie cut.",74422,4
74423,My son wore for about a month.,74423,4
74423,Then he grew out of them.,74423,4
74423,"Tops slide down, like slouch socks.",74423,4
74424,I gave four stars after few months the gold medallion fell off.,74424,4

74428,"Overall, exactly what I was looking for, very cute.",74428,4
74429,It's still a little early to give it a rating but it seems to be okay for now,74429,4
74431,It fits well on me but a little too short for the back side as I do have a big booty.,74431,4
74431,"Nonetheless, it is cute and I do recommend to get a size larger (I got myself a size L as I usually wear a US size 10/12) if you want a longer length skorts.",74431,4
74432,"very good product, does fade a smidge after washes and it was a tiny bit larger than what i had hoped",74432,4
74433,This product is amazing.,74433,4
74433,It really makes you sweat and is comfortable to keep on all day if you want.,74433,4
74433,I recommend buying it,74433,4
74435,Fits A little small.,74435,4
74435,I'm a 5'9 and I ordered an XL but it's not too small not to wear.,74435,4
74435,Looks exactly like picture,74435,4
74436,"The only reason this isn't a 5 star product is because they ride up a tiny bit and I feel it is my duty to say so, even though I went back and bought a second set of the same shirts because they are so great!",74436,4
74436,"I am 6'3, 220 and these shirts fit me tight enough to hide that I was 285 5 months ago.",74436,4
74436,I wear them as compression shirts but I've been caught wearing them as Tees in a bind.,74436,4
74436,Can't say how happy I truly am with these enough.,74436,4
74437,Somewhat large on the top,74437,4
74438,"I' happy with this product, it fits perfectly.",74438,4
74439,I haven't had any issues with it.,74439,4
74440,I find the case a bit thin and doesn't seem like it protrudes over the front as much as my normal case.,74440,4
74440,"Consequently, not sure how well it would protect the face, so may go back to my normal case and carry the glasses separately.",74440,4
74440,"That said it's a thin, light case and does keep the reading glasses in an readily handy place.",74440,4
74441,"Good looking good quality, take a long time to arrive.",74441,4
74442,Quality was very good...,74442,4

74446,dO wash and wear with kid gloves unless you are good at crocheting.,74446,4
74446,It's worth it certainly to me!!,74446,4
74447,It's a bit shorter than I would like.,74447,4
74447,I'm only 4 months so once my belly grows it may become an issue.,74447,4
74447,Super comfortable tho and fits as expected.,74447,4
74448,"Super cute, easy on and off for my 2 year old but they are big...probably .5-1 size too big so they'll have to wait a little while to wear them.",74448,4
74449,I'm a men's size 11-12 and these fit perfect on my feet and a bit tight above the ankle (I'm a pretty big guy 300lbs).,74449,4
74449,If you're not a fat@#$ they should fit fine up to mens size 12.,74449,4
74449,"Not sure how they'll last in the long run as they seem quite thin, but at this price that's not a huge concern.",74449,4
74450,Needs a tank top underneath.,74450,4
74450,Have washed on delicate hung to dry.,74450,4
74450,Not sure how long it will last.,74450,4
74451,Although this product has no voice is speaks louder than any competition,74451,4

74453,It came and fit perfect.,74453,4
74453,Not too tight in my midsection.,74453,4
74453,The top with the different wrap sections on the bust can be a little bit awkward.,74453,4
74453,It'd be better if I had a larger chest to fill them out and keep them in place.,74453,4
74453,But it's definitely a nice top.,74453,4
74453,The inside lining feels nice and it's not an itchy lace like some.,74453,4
74453,I'm 5'4 and 200lbs.,74453,4
74454,"Funny, I bought this one and another in a different color at the same time and this one fit small while the other fit just right and they were from the same company and the same size, the only difference was the color... but due to it's loose fitting nature I can still wear it, it just feels a little small compared to the other color I got (the smaller color was the green and the one that fit great was the yellow).",74454,4
74454,"I have had them a while, they have been through the ""hand-wash"" cycle on my machine and always hung to dry.",74454,4
74454,They still fit the same as when I got them and since the yellow fits great it has become one of my favorites.,74454,4
74454,"Would have liked to try a different color by don't know that I will due to the length of shipping, and the size variation.",74454,4
74455,"I am 5ft, bra size 36dd, bottom size 8-10 and order US/largie(Asian/xxxl).",74455,4
74455,It fits pretty good.,74455,4
74455,Like other say that in bottom tights part is bit tight.,74455,4
74455,"(I have flat butt) Material is nice and not thin, color is true as shown in picture.",74455,4
74455,Very satisfied for how it look and price.,74455,4
74456,Ordered a size up and they fit great,74456,4
74457,It's just a little tight but when I lose a little weight it will be great I like it.,74457,4
74458,I love this.... it's nice and long and fits me just great.,74458,4
74458,"I did read one of the reviews that said that the buttons come off easily, they do.",74458,4
74458,"I've sewn back on 2 of them already, but that's no biggie.",74458,4
74458,"Also, the fabric is quite thin, which is fine with me, I don't like to wear big, bulky things.",74458,4
74458,It's very flattering on.,74458,4
74458,"I'm 5'6"" and weigh about 165, I've had a lot of compliments on it.",74458,4
74459,"It is not for tall people, I am 160 cms tall (with hills) and it almost don't touch the floor.",74459,4
74459,Also material is a little bit cheap but its ok.,74459,4
74460,"It was a bit small, but other than that I recomend.",74460,4
74460,Obviously it didn't like as good as the model.,74460,4
74461,It's a really nice bracelet but sometimes it's hard to get on but other then that I really like it it's a cute and a nice product I wear it everyday.,74461,4
74461,I like it because of the design and that's it's made for a girl and a boy and it's not to girly so the guys can wear it too.,74461,4
74461,I didn't like the clasp part because it's hard to get on by ur self.,74461,4
74461,It's comfortable not to tight not to lose its like the comfort of a bangle bracelet like it slides down ur wrists I like that because it's not tight that u can't movie it and it's not to loose that it falls off.,74461,4
74461,I love the design and how u used it and decorated it.,74461,4
74461,I don't like that u can't use it in the shower because it's hard to get on and I don't like taking it off but it's worth the struggle of putting it on cause it means a lot to me it's a symbol of love and I love that.,74461,4
74461,I recommend this product to everyone.,74461,4
74461,I think it's a great idea and I great product.,74461,4
74461,I like it .,74461,4
74462,They are very pretty.,74462,4
74463,"So I received my hat in ""green"" today.",74463,4
74463,I purchased the hat in black as well.,74463,4
74463,The green hat is the same as the black.,74463,4
74463,"Quality seems decent, fits fine with an adjustable strap on the back and once out of the package and worn the wrinkles from shipment disappeared.",74463,4
74463,I dropped a star because in the photo the hat looks more like a light blue/light turquoise.,74463,4
74463,In person it's an emerald green.,74463,4
74463,The seller does state there is a color variation due to monitors but this is a huge variation.,74463,4
74463,The photo has some filter on it to make the colors pop which has altered the base color of the hat in the photo.,74463,4
74463,The color appears the same on my Chromebook and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus so I know it's not my monitor altering the color.,74463,4
74463,They need to upload an accurate photo for color representation.,74463,4
74463,Other than that I'm happy with the purchase.,74463,4
74464,"It's a little snug, however it does fit and it is cute.",74464,4
74464,The print is brighter than the picture.,74464,4
74464,And I can't wait to wear it.,74464,4
74465,fabric is perfect for summer.,74465,4
74466,The dress itself is beautiful.,74466,4
74466,"However, my built ruins it.",74466,4
74466,I'm super depressed about it.,74466,4
74466,"I'm thinking maybe the cut of the dress around the neck is what makes it so unflattering to my body type, but you can't deny how pretty the dress itself is.",74466,4
74467,"I really liked this swimsuit; however, if you have a long torso, this is not the suit for you.",74467,4
74467,"Unfortunately, it's not very stretchy because of the crochet.",74467,4
74467,"Because I have a long waist, I kept feeling like the straps were going to either cut my arms/neck off or that the top was just going to snap down entirely.",74467,4
74467,"I had to return it, because even going up a size wouldn't solve the length problem.",74467,4
74467,"However, if my body were a few inches shorter, I'd be completely in love with this suit!",74467,4
74468,purchased this for a romantic evening  away.,74468,4
74468,It was a perfect fit  sexy and sleek  It felt so comfortable even with a plus size figure.,74468,4
74469,"Arrived early +1
Decent fit +1
 (though, I probably won't dry it until I loose the weight I've put on)
Cute as the picture +1
Good condition +1

It's longer then expected but I just pull it up cause it doesn't fit me loose (my problem, not the shirts, lol)

The sleeves are a bit short, really wish they were longer

And I don't love how the lace just sits there was instead of being ALL sewn down.",74469,4
74469,"I see it snagging more and flapping like wings in the wind

But overall I'm pleased with this purchase

I'd like to add photos but idk how =/",74469,4
74470,As a female football official I needed a white hat to white hat games.,74470,4
74470,This breathable athletic fabric is nice and fits my needs.,74470,4
74471,comfy however the material builds up lint balls.,74471,4
74473,"And like other reviewers, I agree that a full zipper would be preferable.",74473,4
74473,"Hopefully, it holds up!",74473,4
74473,Can't beat the price for a cute bag!,74473,4
74474,"I considered returning this product, but it hardly seemed worth it for the price paid.",74474,4
74474,"The image used doesn't show a serious flaw in this product: the ""pearls"" used are not solid.",74474,4
74474,They are the the ones with holes drilled for stringing.,74474,4
74474,"So, the necklace looks much cheaper up close.",74474,4
74474,"That said, from across a table, it's probably not noticeable.",74474,4
74474,"But I noticed immediately, and felt like it looked incredibly cheap (which--in all fairness--it was).",74474,4
74474,The first flaw I noticed upon opening was that the necklace I received did not have a chain to adjust the length (as pictured on the sale page).,74474,4
74474,It is barely long enough to close.,74474,4
74474,"To be able to wear this necklace comfortably, I would need to add several links to the chain.",74474,4
74474,"It hardly seems worth it for the necklace, so I have yet to do so.",74474,4
74474,"It's a lovely design concept, and if you don't mind something that looks rather costumey up close, and only appears classy from across a room (such as for stage jewelry or to go with an actual costume), this could be good for you.",74474,4
74474,"I will--most likely--cannibalize the parts for some other craft, such as a picture frame or some other household craft.",74474,4
74474,"I'm still giving 4 stars because based on a price point under $5, I don't think it's fair to rate this product against much higher quality jewelry.",74474,4
74474,"I deducted a star because of the chain being incomplete/broken/not a represented by the seller, and because I cannot say that I ""love it"" or would order it again.",74474,4
74474,"That said... for $4, it's not horrible.",74474,4
74474,I might actually wear the earrings one day...,74474,4
74475,"Too big for me, but I can still wear it.",74475,4
74476,"The embroidery has a lining, and this lining peeled off after jsut one swim in the pool.",74476,4
74476,Otherwise it's a cute suite.,74476,4
74476,Order a size up as it tents to bunch up and become shorter - doesn't cover the legs below the knees much.,74476,4
74477,"fits well, nice top, aspictured",74477,4
74478,"Fit as expected, I'm 5'3"" and it touches the floor without shoes on.",74478,4
74479,Loved the dress- the arm straps were really long but easily pinable,74479,4
74480,Just way to formal for me,74480,4
74481,I bought it for my sister's birthday and it was a hit.,74481,4
74481,She and her friends loved it.,74481,4
74481,What people are saying about the chemical smell is true but I let it air out a couple days and it was gone.,74481,4
74482,Much too nice for the costume I got it for.,74482,4
74482,May try wearing IRL...,74482,4
74483,"Really like the product for the price, the images are a little illegible due to the small size of the 4g",74483,4
74484,"The pedals have the clip in on both sides, which makes it real EAZY to get going, wasn't expecting that so a real bonus.",74484,4
74484,"The shoes are mostly plastic and will not last long, but good enough for the price paid.",74484,4
74484,"Make sure to setup the spring tension on the pedals proper, as shipped they are all over the place.",74484,4
74484,For that lack of QC I had to subtract one star.,74484,4
74485,Needed a bigger size,74485,4
74486,This bikini top fits amazingly.,74486,4
74486,"It is very hard to find a bikini top in a big cup size that is both in a halter style without the foam padding, and with underwire .",74486,4
74486,"I am so happy I found this, the style is beautiful, it is very well made and I really like the adjustable back strap.",74486,4
74486,Very happy with it and it looks like it is worth its money.,74486,4
74486,I bought this for our upcoming vacation and if it does well with the sea and pool water I will be updating my review to 5 stars.,74486,4
74487,"I actually bought 4 pair of Leveret PJs, one for myself, mother, sister, and daughter.",74487,4
74487,We absolutely loved them.,74487,4
74487,They were a big hit at our pajama party.,74487,4
74488,"Somewhat small but very long, VERY LONG!!",74488,4
74488,And I am not a short person,74488,4
74489,Loved this ring a lot.,74489,4
74489,"I wear it everyday, but unfortunately after around three months of wear a crystal fell out.",74489,4
74489,"I love this ring, though so I continue to wear it.",74489,4
74489,The empty slot is covered by my finger so it is not noticeable.,74489,4
74489,I would caution buyers to know that you get what you pay for.,74489,4
74491,Order one size up,74491,4
74492,This is a very  attractive cover .,74492,4
74492,The watch is very smooth and shinny.,74492,4
74492,Just wish that it had a picture in the background of the watch inside.,74492,4
74493,This chain is beautiful but it was big on me.,74493,4
74495,"This is a great jacket, only problem for me is the fit.",74495,4
74495,I usually wear a XL but I had to get a medium which is a great fit accept around the waste where I have a little too much padding.,74495,4
74496,I really like them!,74496,4
74497,"Very pretty...light and airy, perfect for warm summer evenings at home",74497,4
74498,"Definitely an improvement over some cheap plastic case, but mine is finally falling apart.",74498,4
74498,And I'd be surprised if any serious traveller keeps this intact for more than 6 months.,74498,4
74499,The material of this bra is so soft and is extremely comfortable.,74499,4
74499,The reason for four stars is because it runs small.,74499,4
74499,"Fortunately, it's not too tight so I am able to still wear it.",74499,4
74500,Its tricky to pick the shirts from Asian countries but the are so nice and well made,74500,4
74501,"This suit looks very cute on the model in the ad, and it appears to accommodate a long torso and maybe a little ""post-baby belly"".",74501,4
74501,"After ordering several other suits on Amazon in XL, knowing they fit great and looked very similar in style, I Ordered this one in XL as well.",74501,4
74501,Was disappointed it was a bit tight yet and not fitting the way I was expecting.,74501,4
74501,"SUPER CUTE, just make sure you order a size up",74501,4
74502,"I got these for my boyfriend who normally wears a 34 waist, but I got them in 36 due to the elastic waist band.",74502,4
74502,"They fit nicely around the waist, but we're a little baggy in the thigh region.",74502,4
74502,"I'd probably purchase a size smaller next time, but he still loves them and wears them pretty often.",74502,4
74502,They're simple and can easily be causal or dressed up a bit.,74502,4
74502,Goes great with a bootie style shoe.,74502,4
74503,"I could have gotten a large for tighter hold but it is nice shapewear
im going to order a large",74503,4
74504,i thought i would have to get new handles as they are plastic and i thought they would look cheap but they are actually very nice looking.,74504,4
74504,i think i'll keep the handbag as it is.,74504,4
74504,it's soooo roomy; i can fit all of my stuff without problems.,74504,4
74505,"Great material and very cute, except I followed the size chart and found it still very small and very short (I'm only 5'4)",74505,4
74506,"Ordered the XL, fits nicely but would have liked it a smidge bigger.",74506,4
74506,"Nice light weight, doesn't shrink.",74506,4
74506,(I washed in cold water and hung to dry) Good quality and price.,74506,4
74507,"I'm a small woman that needs tiny temple bars, so I always get kids sunglasses, and I've gotten previous pairs from Dicks Sporting Goods because they're the only kids sunglasses I could ever find that were polarized.",74507,4
74507,"These are only a teeny bit too small-framed for my face, but the temple bars are perfect.",74507,4
74507,"The ONLY gripe I have about these is that, if I slide them up on top of my head and lean over slightly, they don't stay on top of my head, but that's not a big gripe, and I know that it's because these are very flexible on purpose so that kids don't break them immediately.",74507,4
74507,"For the price it's a good deal, and if I decide I don't like them, I can give them to my son :)",74507,4
74508,I ordered the small.,74508,4
74508,"I am 5'2"" and the length is a little long.",74508,4
74508,I do own other Lazy One pjs and the length on those are just right.,74508,4
74508,I am not sure why the lengths are different.,74508,4
74508,Fun to wear and makes me smile.,74508,4
74509,it's a cute little emblem that my daughter loves from playing overwatch.,74509,4
74509,I did expect it to be a little more sparkly but it's true to the nature of the emblem and is just a flat silver.,74509,4
74509,fast delivery and good quality.,74509,4
74510,"Very cute and pretty dress, only thing is I did have to return it, since it does run small and therefore very short for a maternity dress.",74510,4
74510,I bought it and tried it on while I was late 7 months pregnant.,74510,4
74510,"At full 7 months, it was cute and fit, although a bit short.",74510,4
74510,"I needed it for my baby shower, where I would be 8 months, I suspect at 8 months it would be shorter, and therefore uncomfortable, as I imagine I would be tugging at it constantly.",74510,4
74510,"The fabric is thin but I was planning on wearing a maternity slip anyways, so I was fine with that.",74510,4
74510,"I do think it should be thin, otherwise a heavier fabric would make preganant ladies bulkier and feel warmer then they need to be.",74510,4
74511,waistband is a bit bulky.,74511,4
74513,I absolutely love this hat!,74513,4
74515,"I wish this was a LITTLE tighter for more support (Pre-pregnancy I was a size 0, 5' tall 110 lbs).",74515,4
74515,I like this much better than the belly bands that I was given in the hospital though.,74515,4
74515,More comfortable for 24 hour wear.,74515,4
74515,Hand washing isn't very convenient but overall I am happy with the purchase!,74515,4
74517,"Great size for my hand bags, I love the price and quality",74517,4
74518,"Nice cuffs, good price.",74518,4
74520,Hard to clean though.,74520,4
74520,Did not come with a cleaning cloth.,74520,4
74521,These are sturdy and well made.,74521,4
74521,However I have a rather small style of running shoe and these make my heel sit awkwardly for now.,74521,4
74521,Maybe once I use them enough to wear them down a little they'll be okay.,74521,4
74521,I bought them due to high arches and metatarsal pain.,74521,4
74521,"They fixed the pain from that, but they're causing my heels to hurt a little.",74521,4
74521,"I think that it's just the shape of my foot and the way I had been walking previously, and not the actual insoles.",74521,4
74521,I can tell they're fixing my gait and posture.,74521,4
74521,But I have some aches from it.,74521,4
74521,I'll update again after a few weeks,74521,4
74522,Bought as part of a Halloween costume and my daughter refuses to take them off.,74522,4
74522,She wore them in semi wet weather and the bottoms are not peeling away (it's cardboard from the feel of it and the way it bends) but I don't recommend much outdoor play in them.,74522,4
74523,"A good buy, look forward to buying the Rio Olympics design!",74523,4
74524,These panties are a heavier material than I expected but they fit really well and are very soft.,74524,4
74524,"I love the vibrant colors, so sexy and fun to wear.",74524,4
74524,These panties have a nice wide crotch area which is good for guys like me that like to wear panties.,74524,4
74525,I use this clicker in my daith peircing in both ears.,74525,4
74527,I went to the renaissance faire with my friend and I was going to use this as a part of my 11th Doctor costume from Doctor Who.,74527,4
74527,The color is perfect.,74527,4
74527,I ended up returning this product because it's folded when shipped which creates a narly crease that doesn't go away easily.,74527,4
74527,It didn't look good and I wasn't about to spend the time steaming it to get rid of it when I needed it the next day.,74527,4
74527,"If you'll take that time or you don't care, then this fez is great!",74527,4
74528,"A little small, but I knew it might be.",74528,4
74529,"The cable leading behind your ear can be a little cumbersome, but they work as advertised.",74529,4
74529,Don't expect to have any level of acceptable vision if you are wearing these indoors in low lighting.,74529,4
74529,I ended up just popping out the lenses.,74529,4
74529,They will get lots of attention for sure either way.,74529,4
74530,I bought 5T for my 5 year old.,74530,4
74532,Too small for bust over 38c/d.,74532,4
74532,40DD 180lbs 5'5 wear 16 in pants Xl tops usually.,74532,4
74532,The rest on the suit fit fine.,74532,4
74532,Had some tummy control.,74532,4
74532,Short/thigh/bottom part of suit a little tight.,74532,4
74532,Very pretty and well made.,74532,4
74533,I adore this shirt!,74533,4
74533,The quality of the material is great and the print has held up fine through several washes.,74533,4
74533,The fit is about a size larger than the size chart described but I'm good with the loser fit.,74533,4
74533,Quite a conversation piece.,74533,4
74533,I am enjoying it very much!,74533,4
74534,It fit nicely with the bands to tighten around the baby's head.,74534,4
74534,"The baby however, didn't really like the strings.",74534,4
74535,This is such a cute piece of jewelry.,74535,4
74535,"My daughter is a HUGE fan of dolphins, especially since the Dolphin Tail movies.",74535,4
74535,We got this for her for her birthday and she absolutely loves it.,74535,4
74535,"The chain seems to be of good quality, although there have been several times that the clasp comes undone without any reason.",74535,4
74535,(it could be attributed to her hair or maybe being overly active).,74535,4
74535,"Overall though the quality is great & for the price, this is a great necklace for a girl who loves dolphins!",74535,4
74536,I got my bag last night and so far I love it.,74536,4
74536,I could not believe how much room is in this bag and it has so many pockets!,74536,4
74536,The only thing I didn't like was the velcro holster.,74536,4
74536,I have a 38 and the sleeve is too big which made me nervous so I just put my plastic one in the pocket.,74536,4
74536,"The conceal pocket is big enough for my 38, the belt holster, and my wallet which is fabulous.",74536,4
74536,The bag seems sturdy.,74536,4
74536,I was impressed being as it's made in China.,74536,4
74536,I hope it holds up.,74536,4
74536,"*UPDATE*
It's been almost a year and a half and I still use this bag every day!",74536,4
74536,As of 10/2/17 this bag still has no rips or tears and the seams are still stable.,74536,4
74536,"For those who are contemplating this purchase, go for it.",74536,4
74537,"Good, looks like it does online.",74537,4
74537,Sizes run a little snug though.,74537,4
74539,Overall it's a great suit and if you get your normal pant size it should fit.,74539,4
74539,"Only complaint is it is made for people who are more blessed up top, but other than that great fit and covers the trouble spots!",74539,4
74540,These are so soft and warm.,74540,4
74540,"I wish they were a bit taller, but I like thigh highs and they're hard to find.",74540,4
74543,"Overall good, wish there were 1/2 sizes.",74543,4
74543,My husband loves these verses flip flops as he can be more active without socks in the summer heat.,74543,4
74544,"I am 5' 2"" 107 and the small fit well.",74544,4
74544,My only complaint is the material is very thin and see through.,74544,4
74546,I bought the size medium based on the size chart but these stretches a lot so getting a size smaller than original would have been a better choice.,74546,4
74546,I got it altered down to my fit and it does fit like a glove.,74546,4
74546,Very sexy and I love it,74546,4
74548,The flower one is pretty big but the others are super cute,74548,4
74549,"So far, so good!",74549,4
74549,"I love the cut of the top part of the dress, it's very flattering.",74549,4
74549,"All in all, I'm loving it.",74549,4
74550,It's a good wallet.,74550,4
74550,It sits in my back pocket and have no issues getting it in or out.,74550,4
74550,The leather is okay.,74550,4
74550,I wish the second ID window would hold an actual ID.,74550,4
74552,"Very long, the yellow is like a mustard yellow, extremely delicate material.",74552,4
74554,Great dress but fits smaller than advertised.,74554,4
74554,"Bought it for my daughter and she is 4'10"" and well under the 140 range and while not tight, it is not as loose as I'd hoped.",74554,4
74555,I ordered size small and I'm 5'4 and weigh 100lbs.,74555,4
74555,It's a little baggy on me but I'm sure someone with meat on their bones could pull this off rather well.,74555,4
74555,The armpit holes are pretty low and the drawstring isn't really a drawstring it's sewed.,74555,4
74555,I feel like if it was an actual drawstring it would compliment me better that's why it's four stars.,74555,4
74555,But overall very soft and comfy.,74555,4
74556,For well but felt an itching sensation all around the crotch and buttocks.,74556,4
74556,Must be the material!,74556,4
74557,Use these socks quite often.,74557,4
74557,I never knew how important compression socks were for long distance.,74557,4
74558,Great looking pants but was bigger than I thought.,74558,4
74559,very good for the beach,74559,4
74560,A Bit Small But Fits Good,74560,4
74561,"I like gym and running so my legs are pretty muscular and the socks are a bit higher than my knees, my height is 5,2 btw.",74561,4
74561,Recommend for skinny people.,74561,4
74561,P. S. Colors look great and socks are really cute!,74561,4
74562,It's just as described and good quality.,74562,4
74562,My only problem was that one of the handle from the big purse came undone.,74562,4
74562,I guess it's an easy fix.,74562,4
74562,I just have to go to joanns and find a ring to match it to hook it back up.,74562,4
74562,Other then that I love it.,74562,4
74563,Gave this as a graduation gift for one of our youth who loved Stitch.,74563,4
74563,The chain part seems a little cheaply made but can easily buy a better one.,74563,4
74565,Very nice but it has sharp edges so snags on the tie.,74565,4
74565,Smooth it out some to prevent snagging,74565,4
74566,bought it for my daughter she loved it,74566,4
74567,I usually wear a size 4 to 6..I ordered a 2xl and it fits.,74567,4
74567,Super cute suit but rhink BIG when ordering,74567,4
74568,they are very soft and the color is gorgeous!,74568,4
74569,Does not over stretch.,74569,4
74569,Wish the straps didn't loosen up throughout the day.,74569,4
74570,It's a really cute shirt... but you all have to be careful due to the fact that these will run super small.,74570,4
74570,I am a M-L depending on the shirt; I ordered an XXL and it still fits somewhat snugged.,74570,4
74570,Wish they had a 3X!,74570,4
74571,I followed the reviews and bought a size larger I shouldn't have it fits as if my correct size would've been perfect,74571,4
74573,Pretty color but leaves nothing to the imagination!,74573,4
74573,Shows every lump and bump.,74573,4
74574,It looks nice and sturdy.,74574,4
74574,What I'm disappointed with is that the package only came with 2 rfid card holder instead of 3 of them as it says in the description and on the package box.,74574,4
74575,"breast pads inside are kind of weird, as in shifty.",74575,4
74575,And you can't remove them because they are sewn inside the suit itself.,74575,4
74575,But it's a cute design..,74575,4
74576,Wish it had cups.,74576,4
74576,But fits and looks great!,74576,4
74577,"The four stars are more for the vendor's service than the product itself,(which was fine).",74577,4
74577,"It doesn't matter where you go or what you buy, no vendor can meet expectations 100% of the time.",74577,4
74577,There's always a glitch now and then.,74577,4
74577,The true worth of the vendor is how they manage the glitches.,74577,4
74577,I purchased clothing from this vendor and there were problems.,74577,4
74577,"After contacting the vendor directly, they worked and worked until they made things right and satisfied me.",74577,4
74577,I will not hesitate to purchase from this vendor again.,74577,4
74578,"I love the design of this - and it has gotten multiple compliments, but it is a little too square for me.",74578,4
74578,It wears like a box and is a little on the short side.,74578,4
74579,Love and lots of compliments,74579,4
74580,Its a comfortable chic dress for summer.,74580,4
74580,The fit is as expected.,74580,4
74580,"If you find the neckline to be low, then I would suggest you to wear a camisole inside.",74580,4
74581,I thought it was SS : guess I should read all the fine print lol,74581,4
74583,These earring's are beautiful.,74583,4
74583,The packaging way they came to me lack's much to be desired though.,74583,4
74583,Not good packaging at all.,74583,4
74583,"They are very comfortable to wear, and the colors are very beautiful, but wow really the way they came to me all scattered and the little rubber backing's all over the place.",74583,4
74583,I am overall very happy with how they look on me and feel.,74583,4
74583,I would recommend buying these.,74583,4
74584,The suit is adorable but I can get into it.,74584,4
74584,I need a small bust size but a larger bottom.,74584,4
74584,It also didn't seem quite long enough for my torso.,74584,4
74584,"After my original review, the company was kind enough to send me a larger suit.",74584,4
74585,Super cute and well made.,74585,4
74586,Gorgeous and very flattering.,74586,4
74587,"The chest is a bit gaping, even more than expected, but the waist was perfect and the dress looks adorable.",74587,4
74588,Love the look and feel of these shorts.,74588,4
74588,Bought the same pair last year in a different color that's why I bought these.,74588,4
74588,This pair didn't seem to stretch as much as the other pair I bought but I still liked the look and feel.,74588,4
74589,this looks better than the picture.,74589,4
74590,Looks great and fits well,74590,4
74592,Some of the stitching is rough looking but solid.,74592,4
74593,Wish they were a little bigger but that's because I wanted to wear them through maternity as well.,74593,4
74593,Juuuust as soft as that overpriced company...,74593,4
74594,Fit great and nice and light.,74594,4
74595,"screws on arms back out, can be tightened, but not always convienient",74595,4
74596,Fit a little to perfect like on the small side.,74596,4
74596,I bought a medium I should have gotten a large:\ its cute though,74596,4
74597,large around the waist,74597,4
74598,"It's gorgeous, looks real and can be used for casual outings or classier events.",74598,4
74598,Only reason I give it 4  stars is because of sizing.,74598,4
74598,"If you're in between sizes, definitely go down a size.",74598,4
74598,I normally wear a 7 on my ring finger and I should have ordered a 6.,74598,4
74599,Fit perfectly and matched exactly,74599,4
74600,The size chart is completely wrong.,74600,4
74600,"I measured myself and came up with a result of large with two inches to spare, so I ordered a large men's.",74600,4
74600,It took two weeks to arrive and when it did I couldn't even move my shoulders forward or zip it up at all.,74600,4
74600,"The chart is two sizes off, order two sizes larger.",74600,4
74601,This sweater was nice.,74601,4
74601,It took a long time to arrive.,74601,4
74602,"Fits very nice, however after only two wears the dress is separated a bit at the seams",74602,4
74603,"It fits nice on me and it's very pretty but what I got wasn't what the picture was showing, mine has more stones running up the sides instead of just 5 in the center, which made it look a little too big for my nose.",74603,4
74603,"Still, I think it's gorgeous and looks nice.",74603,4
74604,The bottom half was still too small even though I ordered a size larger.,74604,4
74605,"Pretty, I am keeping it!",74605,4
74606,The sizing was off by 1 so instead of getting 1/2 inch 12mm I got 7/16 ths 11mm :/ buy they're nice anyways,74606,4
74607,"I bought this dress in burgundy, it came out red.",74607,4
74607,luckily I initially wanted a red dress.,74607,4
74607,it needed minimal alterations and was overall very lovely!,74607,4
74607,I would definitely order from here again!,74607,4
74608,very cute but it runs small,74608,4
74610,Really not ce design with great material.,74610,4
74610,"But I am a solid 46"" waist and have really work on getting waist to fit.",74610,4
74612,Perfect adhesives and soft comfort.,74612,4
74612,Wish I got the next size up.,74612,4
74612,I wear size 7 shoes in women and Wide fit.,74612,4
74613,It only looks good with the string tied tightly.,74613,4
74614,"Can't give 5 stars because the front is a little bit too wide, or spread out.",74614,4
74614,But it is a very pretty hat.,74614,4
74615,I really like these but I wish I had gone down a size,74615,4
74616,My boys loved these skate shoes.,74616,4
74616,"They are definitely not the same quality as actual Wheelies, but they did the trick.",74616,4
74616,The only reason I'm giving these 4 stars is because the wheels stick a little and go slower then what we wanted.,74616,4
74616,"Good product though, and good construction.",74616,4
74617,I am a size 8 in pants and am 19 weeks pregnant and bought a size 1.,74617,4
74617,The band fits well and has room to stretch.,74617,4
74617,"As far as wearing it over unbuttoned pants, it is comfy but if the shirt isn't long enough it is noticeable because the band is kind of thin.",74617,4
74618,"The top fits a little weird, but overall pretty nice suit.",74618,4
74619,"cute functional, didn't break after a few weeks",74619,4
74620,Super cute and comfy for my 8 month old.,74620,4
74620,"However, she is fascinated by the Velcro such that she doesn't nap as long as it's on and she knows how to take them off.",74620,4
74620,Good product but not for mine.,74620,4
74620,I bought 3 pairs too.,74620,4
74621,"I thought this was more of a t shirt material, but is much dressier than I thought.",74621,4
74621,"Other than that, it fits well, and actually makes me look thinner...even wearing white.",74621,4
74621,A VERY GOOD THING!,74621,4
74622,Cool Product for sure.,74622,4
74622,The neck part was not as long as i expected so i had to pair it with a neck wrap.,74622,4
74624,"The top ball didn't screw on very tight, it fell off after a few days",74624,4
74625,With 7 colors available I did not think I would get duplicates.,74625,4
74625,"Actually 4 ""black"" hates.",74625,4
74625,"Two with the same stripe around, another with muliple stripes and one just black.",74625,4
74626,Cute and as described.,74626,4
74627,"From the picture I was expecting it to be thicker, but still very good looking.",74627,4
74628,Too Big for my little girl,74628,4
74629,These shoes are not the easiest for a young kid to manage.,74629,4
74629,They are really intended for narrow feet.,74629,4
74629,Luckily my daughter has narrow feet.,74629,4
74629,But if you're looking for something roomy or easy to put on these are not the shoes for you!,74629,4
74630,i like them but they are a little small.,74630,4
74631,"Pretty decent, but kinda thin.",74631,4
74631,Wroth about $20 no more though.,74631,4
74633,colour lovely a little difficult to iron,74633,4
74634,"Runs big, nice shirt",74634,4
74635,I hope the zipper holds up on this one though.,74635,4
74635,I bought a large black bag like this and the zipper broke after 1 week of using it.,74635,4
74635,I still use it but cant zip it closed.,74635,4
74636,Seems good for what it is.,74636,4
74637,It's a good quality shirt and the logo stands out,74637,4
74638,its a swimming product..,74638,4
74639,Fits well and looks just as pictured.,74639,4
74639,Can be work both day and evening.,74639,4
74642,So soft and pleasing color,74642,4
74643,The product is exactly as we expect it in the price-quality ratio.,74643,4
74644,Came on time and fit as expected.,74644,4
74645,"Great quality and very cozy, just quite narrow and too short for me.",74645,4
74645,I wear a 9-1/2 or 10 shoe and ordered a size 10.,74645,4
74645,"My feet are not wide, so a little disappointing.",74645,4
74646,Fabric is a bit course and irritating,74646,4
74647,Good replacement of my old thermals,74647,4
74648,It was risky to order something that never had any review.,74648,4
74648,"With the price, and the design, this is worth it.",74648,4
74648,"I emailed them before ordering, they suggested for a size S. This is my 2nd time buyin a kimono cardigan from ORANGESKY.",74648,4
74648,"To be honest I prefer M, but S is okay.",74648,4
74648,"My bust is 38, my hips is 42.",74648,4
74648,"If u order S, it may not be enough to cover your lower abdomen or hip area.",74648,4
74648,* u have to remove the string that binds the fringes.,74648,4
74648,Like what's shown on the last pic.,74648,4
74648,"And the fringes are not as long as what showed on the vendor's picture (which is fine for me), but still cute.",74648,4
74649,Slightly different colors however beautiful and I told everyone where I receive my necklace from when I receive comments about it.,74649,4
74650,Smaller than I anticipated.,74650,4
74650,Carter's are larger and Gerber are smaller.,74650,4
74650,"This 6mos which I purchased,  looks like it will fit a 3mo old up to about 18 lbs.",74650,4
74650,"Good thing,  I was shopping for a newborn.",74650,4
74650,He will get a good 2-3 months out of it .,74650,4
74651,This was surprisingly well made.,74651,4
74651,"It ran a little small and it is way too short to wear without something under it but other than that, I love it!",74651,4
74652,"love it but a little smaller than expected, wish I had gone XL but I am usually a L.",74652,4
74653,"You get what you pay for, and since it was very inexpensive, I was pleased for the most part.",74653,4
74654,I am satisfied with this hoodie.,74654,4
74654,It is of decent quality,74654,4
74655,Loved them but I do wish they had had more beads,74655,4
74656,"I debated whether or not I really needed a support for postpartum, but ended up choosing this one based on recommendations from other new moms, and overall am glad I did.",74656,4
74656,"It helped provide support and remind me to maintain good posture during the initial weeks of nursing my newborn, when I had a tendency to hunch over too much.",74656,4
74656,"The support greatly reduced the lower back pain I was having, and it did help reduce the bloated/swelling abdominal feeling common right after childbirth.",74656,4
74656,"I was not a fan of the velcro fastener, as it was very loud and made it nearly impossible to adjust in the middle of the night without waking baby or my husband.",74656,4
74656,"Additionally, it became increasingly uncomfortable when the creases start to settle... everything I read said crease are normal (they settle between ribs and hip bones from how the band folds when you wear it sitting down.",74656,4
74656,"Also, it is too bulky to wear under clothing and rather unattractive above clothing, so I left it in the car when I had to go in public.",74656,4
74656,"However, the pain relief and help with the recovery process still made this a worthwhile purchase.",74656,4
74656,"I followed the sizing chart and it fit as expected, with me initially wearing on the loose side and gradually being able to tighten further on the velcro.",74656,4
74656,I don't remember exactly how long it took for me to wear it on the smallest size... but I think close to 5 weeks postpartum.,74656,4
74656,Overall I'm satisfied with the purchase and think it was worth the price.,74656,4
74656,"Though I've heard others say you can use it for multiple children, for me, I don't think I agree due to the creasing.",74656,4
74656,I would purchase a new one after giving birth again.,74656,4
74658,"I love the shirt, it's printed on American apparel which is a plus and it means it will last a while and be comfortable, but the screen printing on it was not the best quality it will stay on the shirt and won't crack but I can see the texture of the shirt through the printing if that makes any sense",74658,4
74659,"I took away one star because the sizing is way off, but otherwise I LOVE this jacket!",74659,4
74659,"I am 5'5"", 145lbs, I usually wear medium shirts, size 6 pants, size medium jackets.",74659,4
74659,I took advice from previous reviews and ordered an X-Large and it fits PERFECTLY.,74659,4
74659,"The cut is so flattering, slim with a slight flare at the bottom.",74659,4
74659,"I got the Green, and it's the exact olive shade I've been searching for.",74659,4
74659,Love the ribbed knit cuffs to keep the cold out.,74659,4
74659,"The fur is soft and fluffy, and not clumpy looking like on other jackets I've tried.",74659,4
74659,"I honestly don't mind the two-toned buttons, I think it adds a little flair.",74659,4
74659,"The fur came unattached and it took me a few tries to figure out which way to attach it, but that's not even worth complaining about.",74659,4
74659,"Get this jacket, you will not regret it!",74659,4
74659,I might even get another in Black!,74659,4
74659,"Update, 1/13/16: We got 10 inches of snow last night and it was 22 degrees this morning while I cleared off my vehicle.",74659,4
74659,"Let me tell you, this jacket is 100x warmer than The North Face jacket I had previously!",74659,4
74659,I did not even feel the cold!,74659,4
74660,The skirt was about  3 inches bigger at the waist than the posted measurements.,74660,4
74660,I had to get it altered for my daughter as she is tall and thin.,74660,4
74660,"I was worried it would be too short, but the length is perfect!",74660,4
74660,The top fit well.,74660,4
74660,The red is a little lighter than pictured.,74660,4
74660,We still like it!,74660,4
74661,What I was looking for,74661,4
74662,"fits great, dresses up casual clothes.",74662,4
74663,My first ratcheting belt.,74663,4
74663,Will only buy these types of belts from now on.,74663,4
74663,One downside is the weight.,74663,4
74663,They're bit on the heavy side.,74663,4
74664,But I wear a wife beater underneath.so not a waste of $3/4.,74664,4
74664,I would buy more if I could get the right size.,74664,4
74664,Im xtrasmall and ordered small.,74664,4
74664,C ant beat the price and they are cute.,74664,4
74664,But need to know go 1-2 sizes up.,74664,4
74665,I do love this wallet.,74665,4
74665,Just wish it wasn't so mini.,74665,4
74665,"I would like to be able to put bills/change in the zippered area, but the bills sometimes get stuck in the zipper when I am trying to retrieve them.",74665,4
74665,I would love to see a bifold aspect to this item which would double the number of slits and also provide more opportunity to store bills/change more safely in the zippered area.,74665,4
74666,The material is nice and it fits well.,74666,4
74667,"Very cute, but too small.",74667,4
74667,I will have to get a bigger size.,74667,4
74668,These pj's are comfortable and perfect for me.,74668,4
74668,The bottoms don't ride up when I'm sleeping and the neck on the top is not too tight.,74668,4
74669,Bottoms are a bit small when it comes to the straps on the sides; those are kinda tight.,74669,4
74669,I have to agree with all the other posts saying I wish we could mix and match.,74669,4
74669,Worth it for the top though.,74669,4
74669,"Cheaper than what I could find around here, and a lot cuter.",74669,4
74670,Wish the tie were Velcro and not actually tie.,74670,4
74671,"Well made and very fitted, too fitted for me!",74671,4
74671,It would have looked perfect if my stomach was flatter!,74671,4
74672,My baby girl looks adorable in it :),74672,4
74673,I liked the overall fit and design of this outfit.,74673,4
74673,However the button holes were sewn too large so I had to fasten the buttons over and over throughout my day.,74673,4
74673,Also I chose to not use the slip that came with it.,74673,4
74673,As it was too scratchy.,74673,4
74674,Fits great and looks great.,74674,4
74675,"It was very similar to this dress, it is hard to depict if it is the exact one, but it did not look cheaply made at all.",74675,4
74675,I thought I bought in ivory but it is White.,74675,4
74675,"I thought it was absolutely beautiful, I was weary of buying online but was pleasantly surprised when I got that dress.",74675,4
74676,"I ordered quite a few of these,in different colors, to give to my granddaughters, while we are on vacation at the shore- I haven't given them to them yet so don't know how well they hold up but they are so pretty in the packages- I know they will love them",74676,4
74677,the design is not too loud for fun socks.,74677,4
74678,Buy a size up unless you want a really tight fit.,74678,4
74678,I bought size larger and my Daughter is very happy with it.,74678,4
74679,I was pleased with the article.,74679,4
74679,I had been looking for this model Cuddl Dud for sometime.,74679,4
74679,I like that they streamlined the edging on the sleeve.,74679,4
74679,My previous shirt the edge of the sleeve began to come loose.,74679,4
74680,I got the what I thought  was suppose to be beige and it is white and sorta see-through on top.,74680,4
74680,I ordered a medium because I read the reviews on it running big and it is soooooo true.,74680,4
74680,I'm 5'5 147 pounds and extremely curvy 34DDD And thick in the hips thigh butt areas.,74680,4
74680,So I ordered a medium knowing I'm usually a large and I wish I would have gotten the small.,74680,4
74680,It's not extremely big but it could be tighter.,74680,4
74680,But overall I'm happy.,74680,4
74680,Just gotta get a white racer back bra now lol.,74680,4
74680,I'm definitely going to wear this out and dress it up.,74680,4
74681,"Although this gown is pretty,  nice quality & feels nice on, it shows way too much cleavage.",74681,4
74681,"Unless that's the look your after,  it may not be the gown for you.",74681,4
74681,You can not wear a bra because it shows.,74681,4
74681,"So I'd say if your an A or B cup, it may work.",74681,4
74681,"But any size C or up, not so much.",74681,4
74682,My thighs are large and this rolls down my thighs to my knee.,74682,4
74682,I had to use a stocking garter belt to hold it up.,74682,4
74683,I give it 4 stars just because it its as long as I would like.,74683,4
74683,I am 5'6 and it comes a little above my ankles.,74683,4
74683,I like my maxi dresses to touch the floor.,74683,4
74683,It also took about 3 weeks to arrive,74683,4
74684,Small mix up by the seller though.,74684,4
74684,I just looked at it as xxxx happens.,74684,4
74684,"I ordered two pairs of purple and blue, but both pairs were blue.",74684,4
74684,They look good anyway and they're a nice light weight too.,74684,4
74686,The same old story.,74686,4
74686,The waist band was the waistband  very small  Undertaker to a dressmaker to increase  the son of a sign and that cost more than I wanted to spend  I wish that  Amazon would go there  Chinese counterparts that  on the larger sizes you have to use more  material and  elastic so that it fits .,74686,4
74687,I like this coat.,74687,4
74687,I am a bigger girl and based on the sizing chart I ordered the 3X.,74687,4
74687,It was VERY big and I had to send it back for a smaller size.,74687,4
74687,I am waiting for that one to come but I was happy with the quality of the coat.,74687,4
74687,It looked very nice and had nice details.,74687,4
74688,My normal size is M  I ordered M but is little small for me.,74688,4
74688,I should order L,74688,4
74689,Really like it but I'd advice to go up in a size.,74689,4
74690,Material was comfortable and flexible.,74690,4
74690,Excellent in showing a curve in the waistline.,74690,4
74690,Length was exceptional very 'Lady-like'.,74690,4
74690,The reason why I sent it back.....was that the color listed on the site says: Sky Blue.,74690,4
74690,(sky blue reminds me of the color just a little darker than pastel blue).,74690,4
74690,"When I opened the box that arrived quickly, inside was a Turquoise Blue.",74690,4
74690,Would I order this type of dress again?,74690,4
74690,But in a different color.,74690,4
74692,Beautiful doesnt sit square on the neck but still beautiful.,74692,4
74693,"Not deeply stamped, but arrived on time and filled the need.",74693,4
74694,"Exactly what I needed, classy and chic",74694,4
74695,A gift for our granddaughter,74695,4
74696,THE TIE IS VERY NICE I LIKE IT.,74696,4
74698,"They are definitely soft and comfortable, but they are slightly small.",74698,4
74698,I would order a size up from what you normally would.,74698,4
74698,I ordered a medium and it was a little snug in my buttocks and stomach area.,74698,4
74698,Typically a medium would be perfect for me.,74698,4
74698,"Mine had a couple snags in the stitching on the inner thigh, I am hoping that they do not end up tearing after a few washes.",74698,4
74698,For the price they work really well and feel pretty nice.,74698,4
74700,warm and a good value.,74700,4
74701,"cute top, nice stretchy ribbed fabric.drapes nicely.fabric ""bleeds"" quite a bit, so be sure to cold water, hand wash before wearing.",74701,4
74701,"dry fla, and it comes out beautifully.",74701,4
74701,is tight across bustline..,74701,4
74702,"Wasn't bad, just a little big",74702,4
74703,This style was too small but I bought other styles through Meaneor and they were perfect.,74703,4
74703,Returning this item was very easy.,74703,4
74704,"For the price, you really can't beat this suit.",74704,4
74704,"I had a baby about five months ago and struggling to lose the baby weight, so I needed something to totally cover my middle while allowing me to feel cute at the same time.",74704,4
74704,I was so comfortable in this suit.,74704,4
74704,I ordered a 4x and I'm about a size 12/14.,74704,4
74704,"It is very small in the bust area, that's why I took off one star.",74704,4
74704,But I'm also nursing so my busy is not a normal size,74704,4
74705,It fits great and is true to size!,74705,4
74706,Mine is very pretty but it's solid silver without the black weathered letters.,74706,4
74706,I'm hoping with time it will darken some.,74706,4
74707,Liked it but too small,74707,4
74708,Looks very similar to a yumi kim romper I had my eye on.,74708,4
74708,That one was $150 on sale!,74708,4
74709,"It's adorable, but the edge of Peppa was not sawn on completely.",74709,4
74709,"After one wash, Peppa is all curled up.",74709,4
74710,This top is darling and inexpensive.,74710,4
74710,"The quality is so-so, but good for the price.",74710,4
74711,"Way too short for someone 5'7"".",74711,4
74711,Otherwise would have been very lovely.,74711,4
74711,"Material was very soft, stretchy and comfortable.",74711,4
74711,Sad it was too short.,74711,4
74711,Came above mid thigh.,74711,4
74713,I'm 5'7 102lbs this skirt sits on the top of my feet but its the perfect length for what I was looking for.,74713,4
74713,the only thing that I did not like was the line at the top of the skirt was in a weird spot in my opinion,74713,4
74714,So far I'm really happy with this wallet.,74714,4
74714,"I had a Dockers tri-fold I used for years and everyone always gave me grief over how gigantic my wallet was, plus if it ever was dropped or someone picked it up all my junk inside would fall out everywhere.",74714,4
74714,"I was able to fit all of the cards, paper and whatever other junk right into this one and it's 1/3 of the thickness!",74714,4
74714,"The card slots have a little rubber gripper sewn into the pocket so cards can't fall out and it has 2 pockets, one perfectly sized for bills and checks, the other goes all the way down the length of the wallet I keep insurance papers and the super tiny loyalty cards in that don't really have a place to go.",74714,4
74714,The leather has a nice feel and smell to it.,74714,4
74714,I have significantly reduced the lump in my pocket while still retaining all the stuff I like to keep in there but it's now efficiently and comfortably placed.,74714,4
74714,If I had any complaints at all it would be that the leather is very flexible and when you put some things in the pockets you can see the imprint of it in the leather.,74714,4
74714,It does come back out once you remove the object but it's just kinda weird looking but doesn't affect anything other than appearance.,74714,4
74715,"The dress is pretty see-through, would definitely have to wear a slip under.",74715,4
74715,"Also, the material in the picture looks like a soft cotton-like fabric; it is not.",74715,4
74716,Excellent shirt my wife loves it,74716,4
74717,I usually wear a small and I got a medium because it ran small but the Med.,74717,4
74717,is almost too small.,74717,4
74717,I love it anyways though!,74717,4
74718,Nice produce but I had to order a few sizes larger than what the chart stated.,74718,4
74719,Bought a medium as info suggested it comes up small.,74719,4
74719,But it was a regular medium so a small would have been better after all!,74719,4
74720,Very Nice - love the colors.,74720,4
74721,not too great if you got big boobs,74721,4
74722,"Next time I will pay better attention to ""depth"" of handbag ...",74722,4
74722,"Pretty thin, but my error for not paying better attention to measurements.",74722,4
74723,"Nice, comfortable pants for work or casual wear.",74723,4
74724,I Wear A Size 3 In Little Kids.,74724,4
74724,But I Love Them.,74724,4
74724,"Adjust The ""Laces"" And Fringe And They 'll Look Like The Picture.",74724,4
74724,One Thing I Don't Like Is I Can't Fully Tie Them.,74724,4
74724,Hopefully I'll Get Some Good Use Out Of Them.,74724,4
74725,My friend ordered these dresses for us to wear as the bridesmaids in her wedding.,74725,4
74725,We got the dresses 2 weeks early which was great!,74725,4
74725,"The dresses were well made, the material was nice, and the color was spot on from the color shown when we ordered.",74725,4
74725,"We did however, have to have a few alterations to each dress.",74725,4
74725,"The bust was a little small for me, one dress a too short for a bridesmaid that was 5'10 and too long for the other bridesmaid who is 5'4.",74725,4
74725,I would order from them again.,74725,4
74726,It's really very cute but I ordered a small.,74726,4
74726,I'm 4 foot 11 inches and about 95 lbs.,74726,4
74726,but I'm busty so this is a belly shirt on me!,74726,4
74726,But it will look great with some high waisted jeans and some little combat boots.,74726,4
74726,I ordered a black and I'm deff considering order more but in a larger size this time!,74726,4
74726,I'm wearing high waisted jean shorts in my pic I posted.,74726,4
74726,And it shows my belly if I left my arms up over my head.,74726,4
74727,Beautiful well made .yes Iong need heels but made well..,74727,4
74728,"Was a Gift to-for Another...but, They ""Loved IT also""!",74728,4
74729,These are not shoes They are SUNGLASSES,74729,4
74730,"Light weight, need to wear tank underneath.",74730,4
74733,I really  like it  but the sizes  tend t,74733,4
74734,Really nice looking pajamas and great quailty material!,74734,4
74734,My husband wears XX Large and their largest size fit perfectly and really looked sharp on him!,74734,4
74734,I wear extra small and the fit was fine!,74734,4
74734,The material is so soft and quite cozy!,74734,4
74734,"Set them aside for next Christmas, really had fun wearing them on Christmas Day!",74734,4
74734,Just want to keep these pajamas special for the holidays!,74734,4
74735,For the Price you couldn't beat.,74735,4
74735,Wore to a birthday party theme 60's style.,74735,4
74735,Not bad at all,74735,4
74736,Very cute and colorful for a six year-old who is thrilled with it.,74736,4
74736,I like that she can see well through the plastic when she is using it.,74736,4
74736,"That said, I am sure it is on par with other plastic umbrellas.",74736,4
74736,"They don't last forever, are inexpensive, and like gloves, tend to get lost!",74736,4
74737,"It's a nice looking hat, I think.",74737,4
74737,It's just too large though - with my average sized head.,74737,4
74737,"A family member had another opinion about it, declaring they would indicate they are not related to me, if I was out wearing it.",74737,4
74738,The color is actually a more deeper red.,74738,4
74738,The picture online doesn't do it any justice.,74738,4
74738,The only thing missing from the description was the metal protective feet.,74738,4
74738,"Other than that, it is a good size.",74738,4
74738,It has the perfect amount of room to fit an ipad.,74738,4
74738,My mac will only fit in it vertically but sticks out.,74738,4
74738,It is heavy but sturdy.,74738,4
74738,The strap is adjustable.,74738,4
74738,"The metal clips for the straps are thick and silver, which actually makes the bag even more classy.",74738,4
74738,The clip to adjust the length of the strap has the Harvey name engraved in it.,74738,4
74738,Haven't had it long enough to test its durability.,74738,4
74738,Will have to write back in a couple months or so.,74738,4
74738,Overall I am very pleased with this bag.,74738,4
74739,"Fast shipping,  product was as described, but wished there was a gift option available as is shipped directly to my father.",74739,4
74740,looks just like the picture.,74740,4
74740,A little snug but love the colors.,74740,4
74741,Runs a little big!,74741,4
74742,The most comfortable underwear I've ever worn.,74742,4
74743,For the price it was a good buy.,74743,4
74743,Material was thin but I liked it regardless.,74743,4
74743,I was also impressed by the lining that prevented it from being see through.,74743,4
74744,"They were awsome slippers, but it's hard to tell about things when you buy online.",74744,4
74745,"I've got a big noggin, and this is just a couple of hairs to big.",74745,4
74745,"That's ok though, it doesn't mess with my hair as much.",74745,4
74745,Good quality and a good price!,74745,4
74746,"So I have been waiting for this top for about 3 weeks now (gotta love Asia shipments), but it came 2 days before the expected date which was great!",74746,4
74746,I love this bathing suit it's actually my favorite!,74746,4
74746,After reading reviews I took the chance and I'm so glad I did!,74746,4
74746,Now it can improve in sizing I agree.,74746,4
74746,I wish the top were just a tiny bit tighter but it still fits great.,74746,4
74746,"I am a 34C, 5""10 and 125Ib.",74746,4
74746,The bottoms are smaller than a normal medium.,74746,4
74746,They still fit me great but beware they are cheeky style NOT full coverage.,74746,4
74746,Nevertheless it's a beautiful bathing suit for only $6!,74746,4
74747,Love this fit awesome,74747,4
74748,I wear it every time my son has a meet.,74748,4
74749,Great hat for my 11 month old baby boy.,74749,4
74749,Protects great from the sun!,74749,4
74750,great wrap and nice and soft,74750,4
74751,It's cute and i ordered two of them.,74751,4
74751,One for a friend of mine.,74751,4
74751,The only issue I had with it was that one of the danelion seeds in one of the necklaces came bent in half.,74751,4
74751,"Other than that, It was super cute and I recieved some really nice compliments with it :D",74751,4
74752,"It's exactly as shown, yet looks much, much cheaper in person.",74752,4
74752,It was also missing a piece and had to be returned.,74752,4
74752,"A simple accident, I'm sure.",74752,4
74753,I bought this monokini for my wife because I wanted her to wear something sexy at the pool.,74753,4
74753,This was definitely a great choice.,74753,4
74753,Note that these run very small.,74753,4
74753,"So you get a sense of her measurements she is 5' 8"", 120lbs, and 34C.",74753,4
74753,I ordered an XL and it fit perfectly.,74753,4
74753,The quality of the product is pretty good considering the price.,74753,4
74753,"It's not going to be Victoria's Secret quality, but it's not poorly made either.",74753,4
74753,If you manage to get the right size you won't be disappointed.,74753,4
74755,The colour look some how washed,74755,4
74756,Good but a little small,74756,4
74757,My 14 year old son bought it for his girlfriend.,74757,4
74757,Better quality than expected.,74757,4
74758,use it in my desk.,74758,4
74758,sometimes I forget I have it on my desk a bit small.,74758,4
74759,"Cap was what I been looking for, but it was somewhat small got a 7-5/8 head, still happy with my hat.",74759,4
74760,Dress is sexy but the top is somewhat big.,74760,4
74761,I'm not 19 anymore.,74761,4
74761,"I am a mom, I'm not a fan of exercise and have large boobies.",74761,4
74761,I want a bathing suit that covers me well without looking like a granny suit.,74761,4
74761,The price was right for this so I took the plunge.,74761,4
74761,"I have spent days at the mall before searching for a single bathing suit that looks halfway decent, but this year I got it on the first try AND it was an online purchase!!",74761,4
74761,"The bow did fall off almost immediately, but I don't care.",74761,4
74761,I also added two lines of stitching to bring up some of the fabric that covers my chest for modestys sake.,74761,4
74761,"I've worn it about 10 times now, all is still well and I get compliments on it frequently.",74761,4
74762,"nice costume, but thin, she will need to wear warm clothes underneath.",74762,4
74762,"the footies are a round shape, not shaped like a foot at all.",74762,4
74762,may have to cut the bottom of the footies and wear it over shoes.,74762,4
74763,"This shirt is very thin, lite weight material.",74763,4
74763,"I honestly thought it would be thicker, the way that it looks in the picture, but due to how thin it is, it can basically be worn any time of the year.",74763,4
74764,"I love the color, but the chest area is a bit small.",74764,4
74765,Great quality but runs really small,74765,4
74766,"Very cute, comfortable and stretchy.",74766,4
74766,"Gave 4 stars because the neckline is quite low, it's hard to find a bra that doesn't show.",74766,4
74767,The pendant was smaller than anticipated and necklace chain was too short.,74767,4
74767,Giving it to my granddaughter instead because she is petite and would be the appropriate size for her.,74767,4
74768,It is see through in the crouch if you have a thigh gap or bright underwear,74768,4
74770,"A bit low for my taste, but I am also very small chested.",74770,4
74770,Looks cute with a sweater if you're going for a less reveling look for a school function (as I had used it for) but it looks adorable without as well!,74770,4
74770,The fabric is also very stretchy and forgiving; definitely very good if you're looking for something that's not too stiff.,74770,4
74772,Very pretty and seems well made.,74772,4
74772,Wish it didn't wrinkle so bad.,74772,4
74772,No care instructions on garment..,74772,4
74773,"unfortunately, a small stone fell out - but - it doesn't take away from the beauty of this ring and the stones.",74773,4
74773,"Diamonds are over-rated and their prices are set not by rarity, but by the industry.",74773,4
74773,"I love topaz, ziron (more rare than a diamond).",74773,4
74773,"it's really all about the quality of the stone and ultimately, the cut.",74773,4
74774,I bought this for my uncle who is a professional chef and he loved it!,74774,4
74774,"Great shirt, nice material.",74774,4
74775,Very cute bathing suit!,74775,4
74775,The bottoms fit perfect -- I was a little worried that the seams would dig into my thighs but that was not an issue at all.,74775,4
74775,"My only issue with this suit was that the top band (under breast) was too big/loose, but I have a smaller rib cage area compared to breast size.",74775,4
74775,I sewed a bit of elastic into the band area and that helped quite a bit.,74775,4
74776,Very cute and it fits nicely.,74776,4
74777,"I am 5'3 and 108 pounds, the medium for very nice on me, wasn't lose at all.",74777,4
74777,But the material is a little itchy.,74777,4
74779,"Pretty, sparkly, and comfy.",74779,4
74779,Only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is because they took longer than expected due to a shipping error and external threading HURTS to change!,74779,4
74781,These are awesome swim diapers.,74781,4
74781,"They are pretty easy to get on, maybe just a little hard to snap if you have a wiggly baby.",74781,4
74781,The only reason I rated them a 4 instead of a 5 is because they seem to fit a little small on my little one.,74781,4
74781,"I know that my LO is big for his age (6 months old but in 9 month clothes), but the next size up from the 6 months was too big and the 6 months was a little small.",74781,4
74781,"They still work great, I would just like them to have a size in between the two.",74781,4
74782,It was what I was looking for but im worried about the logo coming off when I dry it or it cracking.,74782,4
74782,Got a size medium but it fit like a large.,74782,4
74783,A classy tunic that can be dressed up with scarf (leopard or other beige/black print) if you like to mix patterns.,74783,4
74783,"Fits well,  I am 5'5"", 160 lbs  40DD bust.",74783,4
74783,"Not my favorite tunic, but it fits well and is a little more professional than the more ""fun"" vivid tunic prints.",74783,4
74784,"Was not impressed with the fake sparkle in the font, was expecting shimmery silver.",74784,4
74785,pretty nice a bit cheep looking tho,74785,4
74786,Head cap was skittle small.,74786,4
74786,So I had to use spray color to cover those spots that still showed.,74786,4
74786,But wig itself was good.,74786,4
74787,Doesn't stretch much but the color was perfect,74787,4
74788,This is a great swim suit.,74788,4
74788,Gives you a good amount of cover without the whole piece look.,74788,4
74789,"I ordered an XL when traditionally I wear a size 4/5, or Medium in swim suits, so keep in mind they run smaller in size.",74789,4
74789,"I like the style, however, since I am small busted (A/B cup) the molded cups in the swim suit were a bit too large for me.",74789,4
74789,"It just laid on top of my breast, not really filling them in.",74789,4
74789,It is actually shaped almost hardened cone-like shape.,74789,4
74789,"So unless you can totally fill into the cups the cone shape won't matter to you, but if you barely fill in the cups it will appear to be almost pointy shaped breast.",74789,4
74789,"At first this bothered me, but them I realized it made me look a cup size bigger than I was and I got used to it.",74789,4
74789,I think the cross over draping on the bust mask the pointed molded cups.,74789,4
74789,"However, I still like the bathing suit",74789,4
74790,"I purchased these earrings a couple weeks ago, and I was a little disappointed on the size.",74790,4
74790,I thought they would be a little longer.,74790,4
74791,"Adjustable, cute ear muffs and warm but have to occasionally readjust  to tighten them back up,",74791,4
74792,I will be adding to mine with a few altercations to make it more personal but overall I am satisfied with this purchase and quick delivery thanks to Amazon Prime.,74792,4
74793,Loved the bag .,74793,4
74793,perfect size great handle drop .would have been nice if also had a snap to close it,74793,4
74794,"Very stylish, but awkward bag.",74794,4
74794,"The outside is very stylish and the material is of good quality, however the inside layout is awkward and interior is extremely dark and hard to find ones belongings",74794,4
74795,Feels like you're naked!,74795,4
74795,Only complaint is that they were too big for me..,74795,4
74795,But I wore them over my stomach when I was pregnant.,74795,4
74795,I don't have pictures of The pants but I had them on in this picture.,74795,4
74796,It was perfect and as described,74796,4
74797,Only complaint is the tag that's long ..,74797,4
74797,I cut it out because it was bothering me,74797,4
74799,Much nicer in person.,74799,4
74799,"A little  smaller then I thought it would  be, but that's  ok. Can't  wait 2 wear it.plan on buying  one 4 a gift.",74799,4
74800,Ordered a youth size 10.,74800,4
74800,"The top runs a bit smaller than expected, but design is to be second skin so if you stretch it a bit it fits just fine.",74800,4
74800,Bottoms were exactly as expected.,74800,4
74802,I read the size chart and thought that I needed to order a large for my son that usually wears a medium.,74802,4
74802,It's truly a large.,74802,4
74802,He likes the shirt.,74802,4
74802,The material is kind of see through and feels like a bed sheet.,74802,4
74802,The design is cool though.,74802,4
74802,It's an okay shirt.,74802,4
74803,"Although they were slightly more translucent and the color for some were off, they are great.",74803,4
74803,"They have a little bit of extra silicone that needed trimming, but for the price and the super fast delivery I would definitely recommend to anyone.",74803,4
74804,"One earring was broken inside the package, but I then fixed it with hot glue.",74804,4
74804,"When the earring color didn't match the same as the photo, I actually liked the shade of pink it was instead of this light pink they advertised.",74804,4
74805,This is a cute bracelet.,74805,4
74805,The clasp has a pretty shape but it's hard to hook on to the chain part.,74805,4
74806,"With the exception of being just a tad small, these leggings are great.",74806,4
74806,They are SUPER SOFT.,74806,4
74806,They feel like silk.,74806,4
74806,I will definitely be ordering more pairs.,74806,4
74807,It looks just like picture!,74807,4
74807,Go 1 size up as the run small.,74807,4
74807,My daughter is medium but I got a large just to be on safe side.,74807,4
74807,Plus it's cotton so it will shrink just a lil but but just wash in cold water and you good!,74807,4
74807,I will order again in different colors if available as my daughter loves this 2 pc,74807,4
74808,"Fabric is kind of thick, also the smallest size was somewhat big for me, had to return it.",74808,4
74809,"Nice product, arrive on time.",74809,4
74810,These shirts run small.,74810,4
74810,I normally wear a US size 14 or Large/XL shirts.,74810,4
74810,I'm 5'5 and 180lbs.,74810,4
74810,I ordered an XXXL and it fit comfortably.,74810,4
74811,a little see through,74811,4
74812,This is my second hat ordered that seems like a five star product but shipping dents the hat.,74812,4
74813,"Pretty, size is aa described.",74813,4
74813,I am glad I bought it.,74813,4
74814,My son loves it cuz it's just his style,74814,4
74815,Fits pretty well could be a little bigger in band.,74815,4
74816,I thought the leather band was black!,74816,4
74816,It looked like black leather in the photo.,74816,4
74817,Looks great and warm.,74817,4
74817,"Soft and colorful but the zipper is very cheap and flimsy, usually zips off track and is a woman's zipper (on opposite side).",74817,4
74817,Such a great sweater should only be fitted with YKK brand zippers.,74817,4
74817,This zipper will eventually break and is always a pain to zip.,74817,4
74818,"I love this sweater great with jeans, shorts or dressed up.",74818,4
74819,It seems pretty good.,74819,4
74819,"I have not trusted the phone underwater yet, but I followed the directions to ensure it is watertight.",74819,4
74819,the biometric pad on the front of the iPhone cannot read through the case film.,74819,4
74820,This is the first piece of shapewear that I have ever purchased and have every worn.,74820,4
74820,I was pleasantly surprised with the results.,74820,4
74820,I did not expect it to have the noticeable impact that it did.,74820,4
74821,Lots of card slots and sections inside.,74821,4
74822,It fits very nicely.,74822,4
74823,Hangs well on the body.,74823,4
74823,Looks nice still after many washes.,74823,4
74825,"I liked the fit of the jacket, however the sleeves were a bit too long.",74825,4
74826,"Nice quality and fabric, but a little short.",74826,4
74826,"My grandson is soon to be 4 years old, so I bought a size 4.",74826,4
74826,I should've gone size larger.,74826,4
74827,Worked perfect for what I needed.,74827,4
74827,I went as Joy for Halloween!!!,74827,4
74827,It was a bit small and the fabric is stiff...,74827,4
74827,"But for a Halloween costume, it was great!",74827,4
74828,"So, definitely only gonna wear this around my boyfriend.",74828,4
74828,Not family friendly haha.,74828,4
74828,But I like it and the material isn't bad.,74828,4
74828,Wish t had a liner in it though.,74828,4
74829,Easy to put in.,74829,4
74830,Not a pretty as I expected.,74830,4
74830,"It actually is a little off center, but I'm sure this will appeal to someone.",74830,4
74831,I love it if it would have fit better but I am returning it to get a size bigger!,74831,4
74832,This dress is super duper thin.. if you cut the sleeves off of it it would make a perfect night gown.the only great thing about it is the beautiful sleeves outside of that I would toss it.,74832,4
74832,Do not buy if you are plus size.,74832,4
74833,"Definitely worth the price, I was afraid of breaking it if I adjusted it too much but the size it was in when I got it was perfect for my baby finger.",74833,4
74833,"It does NOT turn my finger green as it is real silver, which is great because I am allergic to fake jewelery.",74833,4
74833,Pretty happy with the purchase.,74833,4
74833,I've gotten plenty of comments on it and I've only had it for one day.,74833,4
74836,Not as shiny as the pic.,74836,4
74837,i reordered a larger size before trying to alter the pants myself.,74837,4
74837,Will keep both pairs.,74837,4
74838,I love this dress for halloween.,74838,4
74838,It is very long.,74838,4
74838,I am 6 ft tall and it just hit the floor when bustled in the back.,74838,4
74838,"When un bustled it trails on the floor about 1 ft.
Don't recommend for shorter people.",74838,4
74838,Was a little pricey but fits well and I ordered an XL as I wear typically a large 12- 14 in clothing,74838,4
74839,"Definitely worth the money, just one thing is the necklace is a bit short.",74839,4
74840,It's a beautiful sweater-dress!!,74840,4
74840,"Gorgeous, good quality, very warm.",74840,4
74840,"However, it fits very tightly; I'll have to lose some weight before I could wear this and feel good about wearing it (I'm not 'obese' by any means, but a lot of these clothes are made for pixie sticks it seems).",74840,4
74842,It is a well made product,74842,4
74845,"Cute, and nice snug fit.",74845,4
74846,Beautiful top but it was too small.,74846,4
74846,I wear a large in shirts but I always order an XL online just in case and I got an XL and it wouldn't zip in the back.,74846,4
74847,Wouldn't wear it out in public but the boyfriend LOVES it!,74847,4
74848,"good size lenses, clear lenses, frame could be sturdier",74848,4
74849,"Good quality, nice pattern, nice fit",74849,4
74850,I ordered it too big so it is kind of loose.,74850,4
74850,You should wear a black bra underneath because it is going to show.,74850,4
74851,"I ordered an extra large as I'm normally a size 16, and it fits just fine over the shoulder, arms, but does not come together in the front.",74851,4
74851,But since it's just a sheer jacket essentially it's okay.,74851,4
74852,Minimalist is for the truth.,74852,4
74852,You can't put too much in the wallet at all but that's the point I guess.,74852,4
74852,That being said its built really well.,74852,4
74852,the colors really pop.,74852,4
74852,Id recommend it for anyone looking to down size.,74852,4
74852,But remember it won't hold more than 3 cards maybe.,74852,4
74853,"The quality is great, not see-through at all and the fit is fine, but it was awfully long resulting in baggy ankles for me.",74853,4
74854,Dress is really cute but short.,74854,4
74854,I am 5'7 and if I raise my hand everything will show!,74854,4
74854,Yet it is really cute and I would recommend it.,74854,4
74855,"I love it, it's beautiful!",74855,4
74855,"And even though it was so cheap, it doesn't turn my skin green like other jewelry has in the past.",74855,4
74855,"The only problem is the chain is kind of flimsy, and it tangles itself together easily.",74855,4
74856,Only downside: Big armpit holes.,74856,4
74857,This product is so nice!!!!!!!,74857,4
74857,It's fitted me good but I could be a little less tighten for comfort !,74857,4
74857,But it's beautiful love it !,74857,4
74857,"I'm 5'6"" weight 213",74857,4
74858,"A little too wide for me, but I have narrow feet.",74858,4
74858,I am also 8 months pregnant and these make walking so much easier!,74858,4
74859,"The dress it is more of a summer dress, and it runs small, but  style/design very nice.",74859,4
74860,"I wish there was more padding under the toes, but that might just be my requirement.",74860,4
74860,I use for running and agility training.,74860,4
74863,Top really fits cute.,74863,4
74863,Didn't like the bottoms.,74863,4
74864,"I ordered the ""red"" earrings"", and the photo is accurate, they are a peachy pink color just as I hoped.",74864,4
74864,"I like the length (maybe 1.5""), they look good with short hair.",74864,4
74864,As far as inexpensive costume jewelry goes I think they look really good.,74864,4
74864,I also like the ear clasp so you don't chance losing them when you're out.,74864,4
74865,"The shirt is very cute, but it is a little shorter than I expected.",74865,4
74865,It would have been perfect if it was a tad bit longer.,74865,4
74865,"I'm 5'8"" so I like for my shirts to hang a little lower (over my pants).",74865,4
74865,"I ordered a size L, which is normally the size that I wear so it is true to size.",74865,4
74866,"Fit is as expected, very lightweight but that is perfect for hot days",74866,4
74867,"Do not sag down during workout, very comfortable & fit perfectly.",74867,4
74867,Will be getting more!,74867,4
74868,2 snaps - 2 sizes.,74868,4
74868,"Our 6 month old is already on the last snap, so if there is another size we will be in line to buy more.",74868,4
74868,Heck of a lot more fashionable for daily wear than the old food bib.,74868,4
74870,It is pretty and fits well.,74870,4
74870,"The missing star is due to the shoulder straps, which tend to move too close to my neck.",74870,4
74871,"Bought them for my daughter , Really nice shoe but larger fit so need to let them back for a year",74871,4
74872,"Nice blazer, fit well and very comfortable, one of my favorites clothes!",74872,4
74873,i like the jacket but was going to return it for a larger size.,74873,4
74873,i did not because it was an international shipment and costed to much to return.,74873,4
74873,a return label did not come with it.,74873,4
74873,next time i will pay close attention to where the product is coming from before i order it.,74873,4
74874,It came nicely packaged and seems like a good quality product!,74874,4
74874,I am excited to give to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day!,74874,4
74875,Fits good and feels good!,74875,4
74876,"Cute dress, a little short, but I knew it would be based on reviews.",74876,4
74876,"Wish the torso was a little longer before it flares out, fits more like a top instead of a proper dress.will have to wear leggings/opaque hose underneath to go in public.",74876,4
74876,Fabric very nice and stretchy.,74876,4
74877,"very bright, but nice",74877,4
74878,spring pins are thinner than original pins on my diver watch and therefore had to use Zulu's pins to fit into their watch band.,74878,4
74878,Also the buckle has no spring bar to change out to use buckle came with my watch which is black ion plated.,74878,4
74879,They were perfect for our event.,74879,4
74879,I wish the torso part was a little bigger as they kept rolling down.,74879,4
74880,These are great and fit true to size!,74880,4
74880,"My only complaint is I've lost a couple O rings already, and the pink pair in the picture is actually white.",74880,4
74881,My hope is that with the Canvas rather than the twill these will last a little longer.,74881,4
74881,Have the twill pant and while very comfortable were not as durable.,74881,4
74881,These should be a good addition to my work wardrobe for winter when a heavier pant is needed.,74881,4
74881,"will still wear the twill in the Summer, as these may cause some unnessesary uncomfortablity with the weight of the fabric",74881,4
74882,"Bottom fit well, very cheeky, and cute.",74882,4
74882,"Top was small, and I ended up taking the padding out because it was also small and didn't cover the whole top part.",74882,4
74882,Good buy for the price.,74882,4
74883,I got this for SUCH a great price & it is so cute.,74883,4
74884,"I LOVE this top, but it is low cut.",74884,4
74884,"I'm 66 and it's just a little risqu, but I'm wearing it anyway!",74884,4
74885,Used it as an accessory for a purple outfit at a dinner party and it was a hit.,74885,4
74888,"Stretches way around the head, but it is ok",74888,4
74889,I like it so much even with the cheap looking ...i mean is a good price ...exactly as pictured.,74889,4
74889,I haven't use it yet but i will.,74889,4
74890,Colorful and convenient to you,74890,4
74891,"these are perfectly priced, very cute one warning though...they do shrink in the wash, unfortunately.",74891,4
74891,I am still trying to stretch the one back out and I'm sure it will give a bit more as time passes but once it shrinks it loses the slouch look.,74891,4
74892,I ordered the 12-18 month mittens for my nearly two year old.,74892,4
74892,"She is small, so these fit great.",74892,4
74892,We will probably be able to wear them next year as well.,74892,4
74892,The mittens come off pretty easily if put on over the jacket.,74892,4
74892,"When I put them on her first, then put on the jacket, they stay on great.",74892,4
74892,Seem to be warm and I like that the palm side is waterproof so she can play in the snow.,74892,4
74892,"Overall, I would buy them again.",74892,4
74893,I bought it to fill and donate to a fundraiser.,74893,4
74893,I was confused about what appeared to be a big pocket on the back but the bottom was actually open.,74893,4
74893,Not sure of the purpose of that and did not like that feature.,74893,4
74894,My daughter likes it and it seems to be well made.,74894,4
74894,"It took quite a while to get here, but shipping was free, so cannot complain about that.",74894,4
74895,This is a beautiful skirt when worn.,74895,4
74895,"It is well made, and true to color.",74895,4
74895,I received quite a few compliments on it as well.,74895,4
74895,I have recently ordered the pink one I was so pleased with this one.,74895,4
74895,"I would give this 5 stars, but it was a bit larger/longer than I expected.",74895,4
74896,"Generally pretty see-through, but love the print.",74896,4
74896,Would be nearly impossible to wear this without shorts or pants on.,74896,4
74897,"I really like this dress, it fit right and it looked really nice on me in my opinion !",74897,4
74897,It was a little wrinkled when it got here but that's to be expected,74897,4
74898,"These shoes are not only comfortable, but are so nice.",74898,4
74898,Bought them for my daughter for her Sweet 16 as her princess glass slipper and they were a hit!,74898,4
74898,Loved them and again couldn't have imagined how comfortable they were for her.,74898,4
74899,They fit great for 5'5 and 120 lbs.,74899,4
74899,The first came with a missing stud but they sent me another one in the mail and I turned the other ones into arm warmers.,74899,4
74900,I have had several strangers ask me about my crab purse.,74900,4
74900,They like it as much as I do.,74900,4
74901,Kinda fitted for a medium but it's still super cute,74901,4
74902,Grand daughter not here yet but this is something she can use for a long time,74902,4
74903,"beautiful , I use as a beach cover up too short for a dress, lots of complements.",74903,4
74903,"I wear a size 10-12 I ordered the xxl, thought it would be longer.",74903,4
74904,Does exactly what I want it to do.,74904,4
74904,I needed a new one and thus far this one is perfect.,74904,4
74904,Now to see how long it lasts.,74904,4
74904,This one is replacing one I had for 18 years.,74904,4
74905,Today Im wearing with shorts but they probably look best with skinny jeans.,74905,4
74905,The heel is just right.,74905,4
74905,"No padding in this boot, not even a light padding so don't plan on walking the distance in these but they serve their purpose to wear for a few hours.",74905,4
74905,"The quality is as expected, a step up from Payless I'd say.",74905,4
74905,The fringe is abundant unlike some other similar boots I've seen which really improves the look of the boot.,74905,4
74905,Slightly narrower than I expected.,74905,4
74905,If ever its raining these boots would be ruined but overall Im happy with this purchase.,74905,4
74906,It's a cheaper made dress but I didn't expect a Michael Kors outfit while only paying $12.,74906,4
74906,So for they price it's awesome..,74906,4
74907,Will look attractive on her.,74907,4
74908,Thinner material than expected but comfortable.,74908,4
74909,"Runs small size wise, but the super breathable material and the thong cut make for a  surprisingly comfortable pair of briefs for any man.",74909,4
74909,"(You won't be hiding much with these on though, in fact, your complete package will be semi visible thru the material and due to the snug fit creating a distinct silouette.",74909,4
74909,I have several pair of these,74909,4
74911,Love the way it looks !,74911,4
74911,Although it does not look over sized as shown in the picture .,74911,4
74911,it does run small!!,74911,4
74911,I'm 5'5' 204lbs I ordered XL and.,74911,4
74911,It fit snug .,74911,4
74911,very thin material and lace looks fragile.,74911,4
74911,Hand wash is a must.,74911,4
74912,"Perfect size, showed up ahead of schedule, love that",74912,4
74913,"The reviews said they run small, bought the largest size but my butt and thighs just a bit bigger than the XL.",74913,4
74913,I am 6'3 and reasonably fit.,74913,4
74914,I was expecting it to fit better but of course with a one year old it is hard to see in person whether something like this will fit.,74914,4
74914,She did look adorable though so I can't complain!,74914,4
74915,Fits great and the bows on the ankle is very cute.,74915,4
74915,Gave it 4 stars because these pants are very thin and see through.,74915,4
74916,I disliked because it was tookay thick to fit.,74916,4
74916,It was delivered earlier than expected so that was good and it is pretty like in the picture.,74916,4
74917,Quality and style is good.,74917,4
74917,Just a little smaller.,74917,4
74918,"Very cute, but do run a bit narrow for skechers",74918,4
74919,I love the color and how it feels.,74919,4
74919,"I can wear anything from a US 2 to a 6 depending on the brand, & I'm 120 lbs.",74919,4
74919,The top is a little bit too big & you can't adjust how tightly it fits around your ribs.,74919,4
74919,The bottoms are perfect and I don't think I could go any smaller.,74919,4
74919,Good thing bikinis aren't really for utility.,74919,4
74920,"Thus worked great as a smoother where it covered, but I'm really tall and it couldn't quite cover my love handles which actually made them worse.",74920,4
74920,As for my butt...,74920,4
74920,"It's literally concave (you may think I'm joking, but it starts like a big girl booty, dips inward in the middle, then pops back out to finish line a good butt) so there was little hope for it to begin with.",74920,4
74920,It did a decent job with what it had to work with.,74920,4
74921,"However I ordered a size bigger then normal, and its to big.",74921,4
74921,But still looks great with skinny jeans.,74921,4
74921,Arrived in 2 days.,74921,4
74922,"Ok band, clearly not the quality of a genuine band by Apple, but for 1/4 of the price it works.",74922,4
74923,"It's a bit thinner then I thought it was going to be, but it is adorable and I'm looking forward to wearing it!",74923,4
74924,"The fabric is not as soft as I would have liked, but it is flattering to wear.",74924,4
74924,"I did have to safety pin the cleavage area, but that is a personal problem.",74924,4
74925,Brings joy with a small investment.,74925,4
74925,Quality doesn't seem great after a few washes (hence the one-star off).,74925,4
74925,But totally worth it.,74925,4
74926,"Slim, fits in my purse without taking up much space and holds a lot of cards.",74926,4
74926,Only complaint would be the zippers.,74926,4
74926,They don't slide very easily.,74926,4
74927,Quality is as good as what I used in the Coast Guard.,74927,4
74927,I wish they offered them in BLUE..,74927,4
74929,Going against the reviews I ordered a size small and it fit perfectly.,74929,4
74929,"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars because the color is red not burgundy as the picture shows, but other than that I love this dress.",74929,4
74929,I will definitely recommend it for others.,74929,4
74930,Anyways does the job.,74930,4
74930,"Great materia, quality and price.",74930,4
74931,I'm 5'6 weigh 145 and chest is 32DD.,74931,4
74931,"After reading reviews, it was recommended that I purchase a medium.",74931,4
74931,The medium fit me perfectly except in the chest region but I have to find a great push-up and plunge bra not the cheap I'm wearing in pics.,74931,4
74931,I gave it 4 stars because description said gold but it's a rose gold.,74931,4
74934,Descent but don't last long.,74934,4
74935,One might want to get a size up from what you might expect.,74935,4
74935,"I have about 3 - 4 inches left over and I might have wanted more, but this works.",74935,4
74935,"Doesn't loosen all that much, either.",74935,4
74936,I like it real nice.,74936,4
74937,Although these are nice glasses there more of a Sunglasses style.,74937,4
74937,The tent is darker then the picture,74937,4
74938,"it looks the same like the picture, but i am a little bit worries about to ruin her from the water.",74938,4
74939,it looks just like the photo but the jersey material can make you feel a bit warm if you live in the tropics,74939,4
74940,Good value for the price - this is my second purchase of this fanny pack.,74940,4
74940,"At this price, it'll only last for so long.",74940,4
74940,But it does the job and makes long runs much more enjoyable!,74940,4
74941,I love this cap.,74941,4
74941,I am a survivor and wear the pink ribbon happily.,74941,4
74941,It fit like it was made for a man though.,74941,4
74941,I was able to adjust it enough to make it fit but now I have a pucker in the back.,74941,4
74942,"It was for a gift, but design is really nice for those who like big, robust watches.",74942,4
74943,What can you say about socks that fit well?,74943,4
74944,I really like the shirt I normally buy size 14 I purchased a 16 but should have gotten an 18.,74944,4
74945,Very light weight which is what I was hoping for.,74945,4
74945,"Color is just like pictured, and the fit is great.",74945,4
74946,"If you're busty and have a small waist , it's going to fit big on the waist but not for much, I'm a 34D and 27in waist, I order a small it fits big on waist but it's not that big of a deal for me.",74946,4
74946,Nice material love the color.,74946,4
74947,Dress look exactly as expected just a little big.,74947,4
74948,"I really like these, but they are very tight on the top, so if you like slipping you pants in your boots (like I do), you need to wear very tight skinny jeans or leggings to be able to fit them in these.",74948,4
74948,"Overall I love the color, and I got a lot of compliments on these shoes, so I was happy.",74948,4
74948,"They are are a bit tight, like I said.",74948,4
74949,"The skirt seems overall good, but even though I ordered a size up based on people saying it was small... it was still smaller than expected.",74949,4
74950,"I like it very much, although it's a little weird that both sides have bottons.",74950,4
74950,"If I could botton up, I'd give it a 5 star.",74950,4
74951,Size is a little smaller than I though it would be.,74951,4
74951,Still fits but no room to shrink; better wash in cold water and air dry.,74951,4
74951,Love the color and feel of the fabric.,74951,4
74951,"Overall, I am quite satisfied and I give 4 stars.",74951,4
74953,This is my bridesmaid dress.,74953,4
74953,"They fit good, but the boobs on them are huge, even for my bigger busted bridesmaids.",74953,4
74954,Should've gone a size up but it is so cute!,74954,4
74955,I really liked this dress it was was very free flowing and looked exactly like the picture!,74955,4
74957,"Very nice product and great service, but the size was tiny, more like a child's size",74957,4
74959,I liked it very much even though the purple was more like a lilac.,74959,4
74959,How do you wash it?,74959,4
74960,"It was made of good material, but was to small.",74960,4
74962,Thought S should be great for a swimming suit.,74962,4
74962,"Turn out ...too small, need 2 sizes bigger.",74962,4
74962,Rippted for the first try.,74962,4
74962,In the trash now.,74962,4
74962,But still like the looks that's 4 stars for,74962,4
74963,I love the look of these sunglasses!,74963,4
74963,I'm only giving it a 4/5 because they are a little too big for my head.,74963,4
74963,Perfect for a man though!,74963,4
74964,"Not the material I was looking for but overall they are great
Has a nice fit I'm happy with it",74964,4
74965,The shoes fit perfectly.,74965,4
74965,I have only used them on the trainer so far and am at 25 miles logged.,74965,4
74966,nice shirt I bought several for work.,74966,4
74967,They are beautiful-the blue is deep and just the right shade,74967,4
74968,It is very nice .,74968,4
74969,Wish they would add more pictures of different angles of cover.,74969,4
74970,It came in a Guess bag and around a watch cushion.,74970,4
74970,I purchased for my girlfriend who liked the look of it.,74970,4
74970,I appreciate the extra links in the bag.,74970,4
74970,Nicely detailed and hopefully study enough to stand the test of time,74970,4
74971,It's very cute and Veryyyyyy high cut lol,74971,4
74973,I like the shirt and all but..... it's not the dark royal blue color advertised.,74973,4
74973,"It's more of a faded blue, still a great shirt though.",74973,4
74974,I ordered larger per all the reviews.,74974,4
74974,"However, if I had ordered in my normal size, it would have been perfect.",74974,4
74974,It is good quality screen printing and overall I am happy with this addition to my wardrobe.,74974,4
74975,However the color shown here is not the same as arrived it more orange then the musty color on the sight it threw me off but I deciced to keep it anyway.,74975,4
74976,I wore it to the beach over my swimsuit.,74976,4
74976,It is light and comfortable.,74976,4
74977,talk of the party.,74977,4
74978,cute but too long for my 3 YEAR OLD,74978,4
74979,The only thing I noticed is that the button is really hard to open.,74979,4
74980,"Great fit, good quality material and construction and great colors!",74980,4
74981,"I'm 5'8"" athletic build (140lbs) and this dress in size large fit like a regular dress.",74981,4
74981,"If you are wanting it to be the flapper style and be loose fitting, you will have to size up, but then straps might not fit.",74981,4
74981,"But, it is a pretty dress and could be worn not as a costume with a slip underneath.",74981,4
74982,I got one that was too small order next size up too large,74982,4
74983,"I have no problem with it it fits very nicely
Will love to have different colors",74983,4
74984,The dress fit almost true to size.,74984,4
74984,Shipping was fast...I received it within a couple of days of ordering.,74984,4
74984,These were the two positive points of my experience.,74984,4
74984,But the dress looked a little different than what the advertisement shows and the color was off...I ordered burgundy but the dress color was more like a candy apple red.,74984,4
74984,All in all you get what you pay for and I am semi satisfied from what I received.,74984,4
74987,The black paint is poor but I clean it.,74987,4
74987,There are silver now.,74987,4
74988,"Just a bit larger than expected, but I am able to cinch the waist in so it works...still cute!!",74988,4
74989,"Cute, quality made, exactly what I wanted and was looking for, with the right price.",74989,4
74990,"The hotpants are a bit small, despite the sizing chart listed.",74990,4
74990,"However, if I had ordered up 1 more size the top would not have fit.",74990,4
74990,It's comfortable to wear and looks good on.,74990,4
74991,My wife loves it.,74991,4
74992,Worked for my costume though so it served its purpose!,74992,4
74993,I like this outfit with the exception that it hides my butt and makes me look flat.,74993,4
74993,It is that material that may be a little uncomfortable to slip into but once your in it you should be fine.,74993,4
74993,"The chest area looks fabulous with the appropriate bra because I am not heavy chested, Nice colors against my skin, overall killer outfit.",74993,4
74994,"Excellent fit when I followed their sizing instructions ,",74994,4
74995,I was very pleased with the fit and the way it looked.,74995,4
74995,"I am a larger woman (5'5"", 220lbs) and I like the coverage it gives me.",74995,4
74995,It looks pretty on and the black is slimming.,74995,4
74997,It is ABSOLUTELY beautiful and the fit was BEYOND my expectations!!!!!!,74997,4
74997,"Now I understand the saying ""Fits like a glove"" because this dress hugs ALL my curves in all the right places.",74997,4
74997,The one disappointment is that I purchased it in white and was expecting to receive a white sash but a yellow one was sent instead.,74997,4
74997,In the grand scheme of things that is the least because it is easily removable.,74997,4
74997,I can't wait for my wedding day.,74997,4
74997,My fiance is going to be bowled right over!,74997,4
74998,Heavier than expected but well made and looks very nice on.,74998,4
74999,The color and sheer quality is as I expected and according to the picture.,74999,4
75003,My only complaint is that it is too wide in the shoulders for me.,75003,4
75003,"Otherwise, this is a perfect spring/summer/fall dress!",75003,4
75004,I like the pattern and the price but it runs small.,75004,4
75004,I am 5'3 and 122 lb.,75004,4
75004,I usually wear size 2-4.,75004,4
75004,I orderd a size 8 of this swimsuit and found it too tight.,75004,4
75007,"I thought it might run small, so I ordered a size up.",75007,4
75007,More of a long top than a dress.,75007,4
75008,I love the fit and they are so comfortable.,75008,4
75008,The only thing that I did not expect was the material.,75008,4
75008,It was thinner than I expected.,75008,4
75009,"Measurements: 36C, 145#, 8/31 pants.",75009,4
75009,This dress is super cute and fits slightly loose.,75009,4
75009,"If you want a comfortable fit order your usual size (based on the size chart), if you want a more sexy/snug fit size down.",75009,4
75009,I like some shape to my dress and this was a real straight fit.,75009,4
75009,"Comfortable in material (soft), stretchy overall, adjustable neck tie.",75009,4
75010,"Not too big, not too small.",75010,4
75010,"Not the sturdiest piece of jewelry, but it's fine for a child.",75010,4
75011,Comfortable and easy to wear.,75011,4
75012,"I'm 5""0 109 pounds so I got a small I have a small bust and very tiny waist with a plump butt the top and bottoms move with you so you don't have to worry about anything falling out the bottoms are very snug but overall I love this bikini I took numerous photos so that you can see the material and what it looks like up close",75012,4
75013,Just what I exspected.,75013,4
75014,"Actually, the gloves are very warm and waterproof and the fit is fine.",75014,4
75014,I am completely satisfied.,75014,4
75014,I only gave four stars because the clip to keep them together is impossible to work.,75014,4
75014,"Otherwise, the  gloves are great.",75014,4
75014,I use them while I am out in all kinds of Vermont winter weather to walk my dog.,75014,4
75015,I got this for when I wear dress.,75015,4
75015,It does its job.,75015,4
75015,I though it would give me some support and maybe lift a little but it doesn't.,75015,4
75015,It covers you and gives you cleavage.,75015,4
75015,Other then those couple of things I am good with it.,75015,4
75016,I love the fit of the skirt.,75016,4
75016,The only con I have is the underskirt rising.,75016,4
75016,Other than that the skirt is wonderful.,75016,4
75017,This is nice inexpensive costume jewelry.,75017,4
75017,The first set I received was damaged during shipping but the seller did replace it.,75017,4
75017,The second set arrived undamaged.,75017,4
75017,I will probably put the necklace pendant on a thick chain instead of the choker it arrives on.,75017,4
75017,It took a long time to get here since it was shipped from China but for the price you can't go wrong.,75017,4
75017,Overall I like it and I think the stone is pretty.,75017,4
75018,The h is a little to small but other then that its coo mine  came with no stamp but i still like it.,75018,4
75019,"I'm regularly a sz XL, but ordered 2XL based on the reviews.",75019,4
75019,The bottoms are awesome!,75019,4
75019,"The top is cute, but the cups are to spread apart.",75019,4
75019,Not too bad if you have enough till the cup.,75019,4
75019,"I really like the bathing suit, but I'll probably just get another top to mix/match w/the bottoms.",75019,4
75020,just wish it were a little bigger print so you could see it easier.,75020,4
75022,Inner bust is tight great material otherwise,75022,4
75023,A little bigger than expected but it was easily corrected by the drawstrings.,75023,4
75024,Not a fan of the gold tone buttons....so I plan to change them.,75024,4
75024,"Other than that, like the material and the shirt fits as expected.",75024,4
75025,This is a simple over-sized T-shirt cover up.,75025,4
75025,"I was happy with the fit, I'm an XL and it was still nice and over-sized.",75025,4
75025,"Sometimes when things are ""one size"" they are snug when you are bigger but this fit great.",75025,4
75026,"However,  plan to order at least 3 sizes up.",75026,4
75026,I am a 12-14 and I ordered a 4xl.,75026,4
75026,I may have gotten away with a 3xl but I'm very happy with what I received!,75026,4
75027,Nice hoodie bought for husband and he loves it fits as expected a little snug but still good fit.,75027,4
75028,Top doesn't work all that well and fits terrible but the BOTTOM I liked and fit well.,75028,4
75029,"Comfortable fabric, long enough sleeves for my long arms, comfortable, not super wedgie causing bottoms, would recommend to friends!",75029,4
75030,Great material and fit,75030,4
75031,It was a little big for my 12 year old and for my husband.,75031,4
75032,My daughter liked it.,75032,4
75032,"Only the smily came out too soon; but that was fine,.",75032,4
75033,I love it but I was looking for a large white bag.,75033,4
75033,Don't buy it if you need a large handbag because this is not it.,75033,4
75033,I like the handbag but it is not the size it looks on the picture.,75033,4
75033,That's a nice bag !,75033,4
75034,But what can you expect from a beefy-type t?,75034,4
75034,"Otherwise, good, solid colors!",75034,4
75035,Took away foot pain,75035,4
75036,"I opted for a size larger just in case, I'm glad I did.",75036,4
75036,Fits perfect and flattering to the figure,75036,4
75037,The bottoms are tight but maybe that's how they should fit.,75037,4
75038,Clove the way it looks.,75038,4
75038,Has not been worn yet so can't really address quality.,75038,4
75039,Little smaller than I thought it would be...but I would recommend this piece of jewelry to family and friends...makes a great gift,75039,4
75040,"I really like the flexibility and quality of this sweater, however sleeves meet wrist which if u look at fit on model it is displayed so.",75040,4
75041,I wanted it a little tighter but it's still a great fit.,75041,4
75041,I like the way it feels and it's really good for working out.,75041,4
75042,Very comfortable and nice looking.,75042,4
75043,the dress is lovely.. seems to be well made.,75043,4
75043,haven't worn it yet as it's too small.,75043,4
75043,i have to slim down a bit but i am excited to wear it.,75043,4
75044,Great size and made very well.,75044,4
75044,"Perfect color too, I have the navy.",75044,4
75044,"My only complaint would be that the zippers are very coarse, but do work OK.",75044,4
75045,I absolutely love this swim suit.,75045,4
75045,The shipping was extremely fast..,75045,4
75045,It got here in about 4-5 days.,75045,4
75045,The quality is amazing.,75045,4
75045,The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the bottoms are a little snug.,75045,4
75045,I ordered the XL which was described as a size 6-8 (which is smaller than a regular sized XL..,75045,4
75045,"I feel like a 6-8 should be a size Large.. but with the sizing issue aside, I do have hips (size 8-10 in jeans) and 34 DD bra..",75045,4
75045,"The top fit perfect, but the bottoms are very snug.",75045,4
75045,"I need a size 10 in the bottoms, however it doesn't look like that's an option, so I'm settling for these..",75045,4
75047,My daughter loved this necklace.,75047,4
75047,Nice weight to it.,75047,4
75048,"Fits on the loose size looks cute with jeans ...
Much shorter than the pic",75048,4
75049,I liked it but it had a extra string that ddnt do anything !,75049,4
75050,If you like sugar skulls you'll love it !,75050,4
75050,It looks great but it feels like plastic that's the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars beautiful turquoise color,75050,4
75051,"im 5,2"" 147lbs, I ordered a large and since my hips are thighs are thick while my waist is very slim, the middle area is a little loose and baggy, and if you have a booty then it may pull on the dress and cause a weird unflattering pull in the back.",75051,4
75051,"but that isn't anything that can't be fixed with maybe a waist belt, and in the fall wearing a coat will suffice.",75051,4
75051,"The material is actually pretty decent, it's on the cheaper side but it doesn't feel uncomfortable.",75051,4
75051,It isn't itchy or scratchy.,75051,4
75051,It's kind of the material you would find on a formal blazer from H&M or something.,75051,4
75051,"I would definitely buy again though, if it was prime eligible and hadn't taken many weeks to arrive from overseas.",75051,4
75052,Its beautiful and very pretty.,75052,4
75052,"The mask is just as shiny as it is in the picture, which does not make it look cheap.",75052,4
75052,The satin ribbon to tie it around your head/face is black and falls as pretty curled ribbons along side.,75052,4
75052,The removable collapsible stick is more like a steady straw w/ a wooden dowel in the middle.,75052,4
75052,The netting/decorative wrap on the stick is easily frayed each time you put the stick in the back of the mask.,75052,4
75052,For my daughter's party this mask was perfect and was very pretty.,75052,4
75052,The mask was also unique as most party goers went to a local party store for their mask!,75052,4
75053,I received mine in the wrong color but they still look very nice.,75053,4
75053,"However, they don't stay up too well on people with thin legs like me.",75053,4
75054,Arrived on time .Was easy to wear ~Comfortable and lightweight.,75054,4
75055,"Nice looking shirt, but a bit on the snug side.",75055,4
75055,I normally take an XL and they are usually a good fit or perhaps just a bit loose.,75055,4
75055,This one is definitely a tighter fit.,75055,4
75055,It'll be okay as long I wash it in cold water and put in nowhere near my dryer.,75055,4
75055,Note: washing instructions say to hand wash.,75055,4
75056,My son was so excited to were to school.,75056,4
75056,"*After nearly 2 months and a handful of wears, we can see that the Superman photo is starting to show several cracks.",75056,4
75056,Disappointing but my son loves this shirt so hopefully hand washing will limit further cracking.,75056,4
75057,Short in the torso but otherwise a nice swimsuit,75057,4
75058,The screwdrivers work fine and are better made than I was expecting.,75058,4
75058,"Didn't come with the extra bits like they were supposed to, otherwise just fine.",75058,4
75060,"Though the material is thin and a bit see through, it fit perfectly.",75060,4
75060,"I ordered this, knowing it might be a thin material.",75060,4
75060,"The green in reality is slightly lighter, just slightly.",75060,4
75060,"It's also a bit difficult to put it on, seeing as it only has a little button and hole, but it was ok.",75060,4
75061,"Coin holders arrived promptly and i have used them several,times.",75061,4
75061,Tge are somewhat mine.w.,75061,4
75061,Flexible than others i have had but still very usable.,75061,4
75061,In tge past I have.vhad several and a few had been too stiff to be usable so it is better to be a little on the flexible side.,75061,4
75062,"Hoody is a little small fits really good, and comfortable",75062,4
75063,"I likr it , which is soft to touch and easy to clan it, I can wear it day and night, even when sleeping.",75063,4
75064,i like the colors and the design but bigger then i expected and leaves a lot of lint on other clothing,75064,4
75065,I love its simplicity and the chain length is perfect.,75065,4
75066,All the LEDs still work,75066,4
75068,"But my boobs are not that high lol
wish the drawing was a little lower on the shirt!",75068,4
75069,"A little tight at first, but a week of wear (2 hours a day) and they have stretched to fit nicely.",75069,4
75070,I think this posting would do better with a model.,75070,4
75070,From the way it's draped this looks like a big/oversized comfy sweater you can just wrap yourself in on a cold day.,75070,4
75070,The sleeves end at the elbow (even though the listing says long sleeve)  and the length hits at the waist so it fits like a fat lumpy short sweater and isn't attractive at all.,75070,4
75070,The green color's beautiful and it is soft.,75070,4
75072,Pants a little big but my 7 y.o.,75072,4
75072,Is small shirt fits fine.,75072,4
75073,noce dress but it is somewhat small,75073,4
75074,And I love the chain length!,75074,4
75074,"I am allergic to a lot of cheap jewelry, but I can wear this throughout my day with no problem!",75074,4
75075,This is a good pair to just slip on & go.,75075,4
75076,Fits larger than expected.,75076,4
75076,I read the reviews so I ordered a size smaller than I normally would and that was even too big.,75076,4
75076,I am wearing it for a Tacky Christmas event so the fit is ok but if I wanted it for a cute outfit I would return it and get 2 sizes smaller.,75076,4
75076,I normally wear a medium and I ordered a small,75076,4
75077,My blue one broke but great price and the pink is great.,75077,4
75078,It is kind of big,75078,4
75079,"Uncomfortable, but will give you a bubble butt!",75079,4
75080,Good quality but too small,75080,4
75081,"Nice material, feels like a high quality tie.",75081,4
75082,"My son was crazy about these shoes, easy to clean as well...you can just wipe them off!",75082,4
75082,These shoes have MOM points!,75082,4
75083,It is great and sturdy.,75083,4
75085,Love this swimsuit but top is way to small not good for someone with big breast,75085,4
75086,The bottoms fit perfect!,75086,4
75086,But the top was 2x big.,75086,4
75086,For the price though its great!!,75086,4
75086,It sucks you cant mix and match the size,75086,4
75087,My wife lovesit for its spiritual quality;I got it because its stylish!,75087,4
75088,"Great gloves, warm, water resistant.",75088,4
75088,Description indicates that these tend to run larger than size indicated.,75088,4
75088,I got a medium size subsequently but they were too small.,75088,4
75088,"So I would judge the size verbatim, which is contrary to the description.",75088,4
75089,"I purchased the ""Bird"" patterned color, which is one size.",75089,4
75089,The color is beautiful!!!,75089,4
75089,- but different than shown.,75089,4
75089,"It is a lovely gray-blue teal, light and uplifting or cheery, and sweet, not at all drab.",75089,4
75089,"My 8 year old daughter was instantly impressed, too.",75089,4
75089,"I like the material, too, which is a touch thick/crisp, and the same type as the other skirts which are shorter without the buttons.",75089,4
75089,I also purchased the green floral and the white with red/blue watercolor flowers.,75089,4
75089,"4 stars given considering imperfect sewing, but still fine.",75089,4
75089,"Summery, pretty, and inexpensive.",75089,4
75090,Not the best quality but it will work for the price.,75090,4
75091,"Nice vests for the price,  with good vibrant colors and decent fit.",75091,4
75091,Also very soft and light material.,75091,4
75092,Fit me a little small but that's ok it still fits came earlier then it was supposed to so that's a plus and it was very well made and was very nice and pretty,75092,4
75093,Looks pretty but worried it might contain lead since it came from China.,75093,4
75093,The part that hangs on your neck is a rope fabric and is comfortable.,75093,4
75094,I love the color of this dress.,75094,4
75094,Wonderful for the summer.,75094,4
75094,I order 2 additional dresses in larger sizes but I was so disappointed when they didn't arrive.,75094,4
75095,but was too large.,75095,4
75096,This bathing suit is well made and super cute.,75096,4
75096,"I am 5'1"" and weigh 107.",75096,4
75096,I am short waisted and have a small bust.,75096,4
75096,I ordered the small and the medium.,75096,4
75096,The small fit but was a little tight for my liking.,75096,4
75096,The medium was a little loose in the lace part and the bust area.,75096,4
75096,It could still work but I don't think I'll keep either.,75096,4
75096,Im a little picky with swimwear but was not disappointed with the cost or quality of this suit.,75096,4
75098,Looks a size smaller than expected.,75098,4
75099,It fits me the way i expected.,75099,4
75099,And its super cute .,75099,4
75099,im on the thin side so it was good .,75099,4
75099,"the only thing i do not like , is the sleeves.",75099,4
75099,Its best if they weren't even there.,75099,4
75099,It felt a little bit uncomfortable for me .,75099,4
75099,i can only speak for myself so yeah .,75099,4
75099,other than that the product is great,75099,4
75100,Had to order 2 sizes up because it runs small.,75100,4
75100,Otherwise it's a very cute shirt.,75100,4
75101,Just a flip flop.,75101,4
75102,It is much shorter than I expected.,75102,4
75102,It barely covers my butt.,75102,4
75102,If you want a short dress then this one is for you.,75102,4
75105,The top fit as expected.,75105,4
75105,The bottoms seemed a little baggy in the legs.,75105,4
75105,The bottoms are not too tight around the waist like other pjs in this style.,75105,4
75105,"I was expecting the bottoms to be more fitted like in the picture, but they are more like tight fitting joggers.",75105,4
75105,I hope these do not shrink at all because the arms are just long enough.,75105,4
75105,"Otherwise, the pajamas are comfy.",75105,4
75106,"Super cute, but order two sizes up unless you like it extremely tight.",75106,4
75106,The large fits my size 6 sister.,75106,4
75107,Fits perfect only wish had full zipper as it is hard to remove after a workout with lots of sweat so 4 stars for me.,75107,4
75108,"For the ""China"" outfits this one impressed me, I've bought a few and haven't been too impressed with many.",75108,4
75108,This fit well and washed well.,75108,4
75108,"I was expected a black skirt but its navy, I'm ok with that.",75108,4
75108,"The white shirt is not exactly a super nice fabric but you get what you pay for, right?",75108,4
75108,My 6 year old LOVES it.,75108,4
75108,And she looks super adorable and chic in it!,75108,4
75109,"very comfy, thin, kinda thin in the thigh, but still fit, just different from what my son is used to.",75109,4
75110,I got this charm for my granddaughter.,75110,4
75110,It is very lovely and meets expectation.,75110,4
75112,Looks amazing but pretty bulky.,75112,4
75112,Maybe thats thats just the style.,75112,4
75113,"I had to exchange for a smaller size, however the company was very responsive/easy to work with.",75113,4
75113,The suit is seriously NEON pink - like surveyors paint.,75113,4
75113,"The fabric is good quality, the underwires are sturdy.",75113,4
75114,It was cute and super comfortable,75114,4
75115,"It looks really natural, so much so that people thought it was my real hair, and I got a ton of compliments.",75115,4
75115,It also has a nice auburn tone that the pictures don't quite capture.,75115,4
75115,"That being said, it sheds a lot!",75115,4
75115,"It doesn't matter as much because the hair is thick, but it can be a little annoying.",75115,4
75117,They are smaller than I expected but they work great for the zippers.,75117,4
75117,I wanted them to help my son remember to zip up all of the sections and to make is boring luggage more fun.,75117,4
75117,We haven't used it on a plane trip yet so I'm not sure how easy they would be to spot out of other luggage but you would definitely notice them the closer to you the suitcase gets.,75117,4
75118,They are a little top-heavy,75118,4
75119,These are sweet shoes!,75119,4
75119,"They fit my daughter perfectly, are easy to put on and take off, comfortable, and (most importantly), super sparkly!",75119,4
75119,"Also, there is a nice, rubber sole.",75119,4
75119,I would definitely recommend these.,75119,4
75120,Fabric is of surprisingly good quality (withstanding many more washes without becoming pilly) than I expected.,75120,4
75121,I think most people know if you order anything from China or Asia the sizes run really small so you have to get one that is usually 2 sizes bigger than you normally wear so just as long as you get two sizes bigger it fits good,75121,4
75122,This blazer is just cute!!!,75122,4
75122,Light weight but doesnt look or feel too cheap.,75122,4
75123,It was relatively easy to replace the OEM pins on my Suunto Core with the new lugs.,75123,4
75123,"To prevent the replacement screw heads for the new pins from backing out, use Loctite Blue (or a comparable thread locker) on their screw  threads during assembly.",75123,4
75123,"The only thing to note is that with this setup (wearing a NATO-style band), the watch sits a bit higher on my wrist.",75123,4
75123,"The Core is a 'bulky' watch anyway, so this isn't too much of a problem for me.",75123,4
75125,"Too small, do not use it, sold it.",75125,4
75125,The next'll ask a larger size,75125,4
75126,This dress is very cute and affordable.,75126,4
75126,It fits well and is reasonably comfortable.,75126,4
75126,The only downsides are that the shoulders of the dress fall at a weird angle and that it's made out of a cheaper looking material.,75126,4
75126,"All things considered though, it's a great dress for the low price point.",75126,4
75127,Bought for my daughter.,75127,4
75128,The earring look very good.,75128,4
75128,I am very pleased.,75128,4
75129,Less bulky than the double-strap NATO models.,75129,4
75130,My daughter wears it often.,75130,4
75130,The only thing I did not like is it was shipped from China.,75130,4
75130,"I like to have thing shipped from USA, Saves on the environment.",75130,4
75130,I will not buy again because of that.,75130,4
75131,Wish they had an extra large but I was able to squeeze into the large.,75131,4
75132,The shirt fits great but the shorts are way too big!,75132,4
75132,shipping takes a couple weeks to get.,75132,4
75134,Love the style and pretty good quality.,75134,4
75134,"I'm not crazy about the nose holders, but that goes for any sunglasses with that design.",75134,4
75134,"Overall, I really like them and I get a lot of compliments on them.",75134,4
75136,Very cute shoes and my son loves them.,75136,4
75136,They feel soft and comfy.,75136,4
75136,They do for small I would have ordered a whole size larger.,75136,4
75137,"I gave it a 4 because it is thin , fits good, looks like the picture,  i just wish it wasn't so thin",75137,4
75138,I usually wear a medium in tops and 8 in pants.,75138,4
75138,I ordered the xl.,75138,4
75138,I prob could have gotten away w the large.,75138,4
75138,But I ordered as a swim cover so it worked nicely.,75138,4
75138,Looks exactly as pictured.,75138,4
75138,Very sporty cut and feel to it so it's hard to dress it up.,75138,4
75138,I don't see myself being able to use this for anything but a swim cover but that's what i purchased it for so it's perfect.,75138,4
75138,I'm 5'8 and it covered my bottom and was a nice short dress.,75138,4
75139,Looks amazing along with other accessories.,75139,4
75139,Unfortunately it broke very easily :/ but if you are gentle with it you will have a great accessory for the price.,75139,4
75139,It is very small on my wrist.,75139,4
75139,Just letting people know who see this that it is not a big watch (clearly).,75139,4
75139,Just trying to help!,75139,4
75140,"The pink is much brighter than it looks in the product picture, but I actually like it!",75140,4
75140,It's very warm and long and sturdy.,75140,4
75140,"My ONLY complaint so far is that the pockets are weirdly placed, they are REALLY far back and uncomfortable to use.",75140,4
75140,"Otherwise, cute, comfy, love it!",75140,4
75141,Beautiful and neat on me,75141,4
75142,Love it but much too big,75142,4
75143,Love the style and the fit but the sequins are super itchy on the back.,75143,4
75143,I have to wear a long sleeve shirt under it to be comfortable.,75143,4
75143,I will see if I can find someone to sew material under the shirt.,75143,4
75145,LOVE the hot pink!,75145,4
75146,"The chain is a little long, but that is easily fixed.",75146,4
75147,The top was a little big..,75147,4
75147,But other then that it fits nicely,75147,4
75148,"Wonderful bag,  looks and feels very durable.",75148,4
75148,The only problem is there is no shoulder strap.,75148,4
75148,Have contacted amazon and waiting for a response on how to handle the missing strap.,75148,4
75148,Will update on that issue.,75148,4
75150,I found it to be somewhat small however I'll deal with it.,75150,4
75150,It does seem to be well made and of good quality.,75150,4
75151,Idk if it's helping flatten my stomach but it does create an illusion of a flatter tummy,75151,4
75152,"I am 5'4"" 135 bought large form fitting but not tight, fits perfect.",75152,4
75152,Material is translucent and thin but this was expected.,75152,4
75153,I'm giving the dress 4 stars only because it wasn't send with the hooks for the neck of the dress.,75153,4
75153,But other than that the dress is wonderful.,75153,4
75153,Very pretty my daughter will be gorgeous at the homecoming dance.,75153,4
75154,My daughter bought this for her Twenty One Pilots look.,75154,4
75154,"She loves it, great quality material.",75154,4
75154,Looks fantastic at a great price.,75154,4
75154,The shipping was kinda slow (in Amazon standards)- but understandable since its shipped from China..,75154,4
75155,All the  gals attending the bride wore these.,75155,4
75155,Lovely for a beach wedding.,75155,4
75156,They were great but ordering them online meant we couldn't try them on our son before we bought them and they ended up being too small for him.,75156,4
75156,They are still a great product though.,75156,4
75157,Bought the gloves for my son in law.,75157,4
75157,He really liked them especially when shovelling snow.,75157,4
75157,They did keep his hands dry.,75157,4
75158,It has the right amount of shine and the stone is not too big which is perfect.,75158,4
75159,Too long and not enough holes :(.,75159,4
75159,I just ruined it making extra holes.,75159,4
75160,The hat is comfortable and the presence of the ear flaps makes it very utilitarian.,75160,4
75161,Size small is too big for a boys size 6.,75161,4
75161,The material surprised me.,75161,4
75161,It feels almost like a paper.,75161,4
75161,One wear and it's held up.,75161,4
75161,I wonder how it will do long term.,75161,4
75162,"Very nice belt but stiff,
Great delivery.",75162,4
75163,I got a small because I saw in some reviews that it was too big...well it fits but it's hard to put on and i was scared to rip it...i think if I gain a pound I won't be able to fit in anymore.,75163,4
75163,It's better to get a size so it's  lose...worse case scenario is better to sew than to add fabric,75163,4
75164,I think they're okay.,75164,4
75164,bought for European trip - needed quick dry feature.,75164,4
75164,"I have hand washed them, rolled them up in a towel to get out excess moisture as directed and hung them to dry in my bathroom as I would at a hotel when I travel.",75164,4
75164,it took a few hours but they easily dried overnight.,75164,4
75164,the size is a broad range for men and women.,75164,4
75164,I wear a woman's size 6 and they were big.,75164,4
75164,I wouldn't normally wear a sock that big but I think it could be okay.,75164,4
75164,(better than too small)  they are light weight but a decent weave so they should wear well.,75164,4
75164,I haven't actually worn them for more than a few minutes yet -  too hot in Texas for socks!,75164,4
75164,I didn't give them 5 stars because they need to adjust the sizing in their description to more accurately reflect the true size.,75164,4
75165,I purchased this as a maternity swimsuit in an XXL to wear at 6-7 months pregnant.,75165,4
75165,I was very happy with the fit and will most likely continue to wear this summer after baby has arrived.,75165,4
75165,"I normally wear a medium US size when not pregnant, I am 5'6"" and normally weigh between 130-135.",75165,4
75165,Hope this helps with other women's fit questions!,75165,4
75166,The quality is good and it fits just right,75166,4
75167,Super comfortable and they don't shrink much.,75167,4
75167,I would love it if they wouldn't shrink at all but that is a battle you can't win with cotton.,75167,4
75168,For the price it's completely worth it.,75168,4
75168,The bow is sloppy and uneven but i wasn't expecting perfection.,75168,4
75168,"I read all the reviews and it said to go two sizes bigger than you normally would, but that was so off.",75168,4
75168,To put it into perspective I'm usually a small and size 6 dress at h&m and most other stores.,75168,4
75168,So I ordered a large and it fit so awkwardly because it was too big.,75168,4
75168,I wish I had gone with a medium instead.,75168,4
75168,"I would say go one size up instead of two, based on your normal size at h&m.",75168,4
75168,It also came a lot faster than expected!,75168,4
75168,It was a pleasant surprise.,75168,4
75169,Cute but size down one from their chart.,75169,4
75170,Very beautiful and well made dress.,75170,4
75170,I ordered the green color and it is the light army green shade not the dark one.,75170,4
75170,I loved the green one so much that I decided to order the black one and went up a size to xx large because the green one fits a bit too snug.,75170,4
75170,"Not to mention, the breast area is incredibly small.",75170,4
75170,"I'm only a  38C, so not very big at all, but the chest area does not close as it should.",75170,4
75170,I received the black dress and fell in love with it until it wouldn't fit at all despite it being a size larger.,75170,4
75170,It's disappointing to say the least since the detail is gorgeous.,75170,4
75170,"If it were not for the inconsistencies in sizing, I would have given the dress a 5 star review.",75170,4
75171,"Not the best quality cotton but decent, fits my 2 year old perfectly.",75171,4
75172,Travel kit is nice.,75172,4
75172,"It was a little smaller than I expected, but certainly serves it's purpose.",75172,4
75173,Arrived in a different color than the one I chose.,75173,4
75173,"Material is thin , but it fit well.",75173,4
75174,I like them but there was a lot of lint in them.,75174,4
75174,Turn inside out and wash first.,75174,4
75177,I love these gowns.,75177,4
75177,They're so comfortable and soft.,75177,4
75177,They're the only gowns that I like for winter.,75177,4
75178,"I bought my usual size (12) and it fits well (I am 5'3"", 135 lbs).",75178,4
75178,The material is very soft against the skin and the wine red color is true to the picture.,75178,4
75178,The deep V neck requires me to pin the top.,75178,4
75179,I was worried about the size but it was just fine.,75179,4
75181,Seems to work fine to make large hats fit better.,75181,4
75182,I have bought two of these.,75182,4
75182,The zippers on my original have come apart after lots of washes.,75182,4
75182,"For the price, it's nice.",75182,4
75183,This shouldn't be labeled a dress- it's definitely a shirt.,75183,4
75183,It does not cover your bottom well enough to be a dress.,75183,4
75183,Very happy with the fit and quality,75183,4
75184,The shoes are stunning and my 6 year old granddaughter just loved them.,75184,4
75184,Theya are not particularly cushioned but sturdy,75184,4
75185,Unfortunately I have gained weight and getting a bathing suit to cover under the arms and the bottom is not easy.,75185,4
75185,It is as flattering as a bathing suit can be at this point (with the weight gain) and fits properly.,75185,4
75185,I recommend it for all sizes.,75185,4
75185,"It is not skimpy, so it is perfect for those that want ""proper"" coverage.",75185,4
75185,"It is not ""revealing"".",75185,4
75186,"Love the fit, feel, easy flowing style and comfort of this lounger.",75186,4
75186,"It doesn't have pockets, so I had a friend add a pocket on each of the two side seams and now it's perfect.",75186,4
75186,"If it came with pockets, I would have given it a 5-star rating!",75186,4
75186,"I wear it out and about as a casual dress instead of just lounging around the house, and get compliments each and every time!",75186,4
75186,"Because I'm not big on ironing, I turn the lounger inside out and hang this outside to dry and the breeze gets out most of the wrinkles; which is all that's needed since it wrinkles when you sit (just the nature of this fabric).",75186,4
75186,I've bought several of these and definitely recommend them!,75186,4
75187,The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the post are a little long.,75187,4
75189,A little tight but I do love them!!,75189,4
75190,Nice sized  purse.,75190,4
75190,Shoulder strap broke after a few uses.,75190,4
75190,The permanent straps are long enough to go over the shoulder as well.,75190,4
75190,Not bad for the money.,75190,4
75191,So far I like the suit; fits like expected.,75191,4
75191,"It lost a star because, for some reason the TYR logo is coming off--as in it is sticking to other parts of the suit and leaving white on the parts it touches.",75191,4
75191,I've never had anything like that happen before with a TYR suit.,75191,4
75192,Bought for son to use at camp.,75192,4
75192,He was pleased with fit.,75192,4
75193,Love the color and style!,75193,4
75194,I ordered up a size because other similar clothing purchase online was very narrow.,75194,4
75194,So this one size up now is too big.,75194,4
75194,But I will have it altered,75194,4
75195,They are polyester so if that is what your looking for these fit the bill!,75195,4
75197,Love the boot but too narrow and the instep is very tight.,75197,4
75197,I was going to return them but I bought a boot stretcher instead.,75197,4
75198,"Great tops, but I thought they were a little thin which is why only 4 stars.",75198,4
75198,"And the material was easily ""piled"" across the stomach.",75198,4
75199,"Very cute, planning on wearing it with an order sized sweater and just loved the way the leggings looked.",75199,4
75199,They stretched well without losing its form.,75199,4
75201,"Absolutely loved this product, the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was simply because the wallet collected dirt very easily and there is no real way to clean it.",75201,4
75201,Other than that I love all the compartments.,75201,4
75201,I used this because I was a waitress and it made it very easy to keep my money and tips separate but in one spot at the same time.,75201,4
75201,Would definitely look in to buying this product again.,75201,4
75202,"It's a sturdy wallet with ""high fi protection"",no complaints really,but,the product scratches up quick,thus leaving it with an unpromising visual...other than that,it's alright.",75202,4
75204,Ok for the money,75204,4
75205,I only gave it 4 stars because it's a little short.,75205,4
75205,"I'm 5'2"" and it's short on me.",75205,4
75207,"Love it, although I wish there was a little more room in the arms.",75207,4
75208,"Fits perfectly, does a great job of hiding in my loves!",75208,4
75208,"I wish the clasps were a little more inconspicuous, I can't wear it with a smooth fabric that hugs the body...",75208,4
75210,"robe is nice and fit well, shoes are terrible",75210,4
75211,"I should have ordered a size down, but I like the product.",75211,4
75212,Provides nice coverage and I like the colors.,75212,4
75213,fit me perfect but it is slightly see through but nevertheless I am pleased,75213,4
75214,My boyfriend really liked this.,75214,4
75214,I'm happy with it is.,75214,4
75216,It fits and looks great I would buy another one in a different style,75216,4
75217,Worked great for 2 days... now it's too big haha.,75217,4
75217,Which I guess isn't a bad thing.,75217,4
75217,Prepregnancy I was 120lbs.,75217,4
75217,"I weighed 175 at the end, and am just now 6 weeks post partum, 145lbs.",75217,4
75217,"The medium is too large now, it is snug tightened all the way, but not tight enough.",75217,4
75217,I will be ordering a small in the near future!,75217,4
75218,It's perfect for work.,75218,4
75218,The material is that stretchy kind but it doesn't look...inexpensive.,75218,4
75218,I prefer things I can just kind of wash and hang dry when it comes to work clothes because it is so much easier on the pockets and maintenance wise.,75218,4
75218,Definitely a good deal and the price was right.,75218,4
75218,Not to mention it fit as expected.,75218,4
75220,ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT...,75220,4
75220,IT CAME AS I SPECTED I RECOMMENDED QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL 100% OK,75220,4
75221,It has these giant gaps in wallet.,75221,4
75221,Afraid money will fall out.,75221,4
75222,"Hoped it would shrink in length when washed, but it didn't.",75222,4
75222,Product is well made.,75222,4
75222,Remember it is tunic length,75222,4
75223,"True to size but as others have stated, it is thin material.",75223,4
75223,I don't see this suit last very long.,75223,4
75223,But you can't beat the price.,75223,4
75224,you might want to take the plastic out and put a mono fin in,75224,4
75225,This water shoe is durable.,75225,4
75225,It lasted through my 19 month old's weekend visit to an indoor water park.,75225,4
75225,My only issue is that I feel it runs a tad small.,75225,4
75225,He is a size 6 in all of his shoes.,75225,4
75225,I ordered a size 6 in this water shoe and they fit almost too perfect.,75225,4
75225,They will definitely not make it through the summer.,75225,4
75226,I like the dress...its really pretty and it has a corset back that helps with size issues.,75226,4
75226,I was worried that an XL wouldnt fit but having the corset back really helps.,75226,4
75226,the only thing is that there is some boning in the back that is kinda of weird but not a huge deal.,75226,4
75227,fits as expected for a Jr.. wish there were larger sizes.,75227,4
75228,I loved this dress but it was too big around the bust area.,75228,4
75228,I had to take it to get altered.,75228,4
75228,The price was perfect but after paying $15 for alterations it was more than what I wanted to pay.,75228,4
75228,It was still a fun dress to wear for my 1920s event.,75228,4
75229,"Ok, I said fit as expected however it does not.",75229,4
75229,"It is not too big or too small, my upper body is a C and lower is Large.",75229,4
75229,So it does fit a little small on the lower area and a little loose in the breast area.,75229,4
75229,I love the style.,75229,4
75230,"Nice skirt, good material but I thought that I would be able to wear it to work.",75230,4
75230,"I'm 5'10"" and the large fits but this skirt is not very long.",75230,4
75231,They are so adorable on my 7 week old daughter!,75231,4
75231,They are not adjustable as others of this style are.,75231,4
75231,They are sewn in place.,75231,4
75233,It came looking just like the picture.,75233,4
75233,I would have gave it 5 stars but one of the loops in back of the dress was sewn shut and I had to use a box cutter to open it up so I could lace it up.,75233,4
75233,I would recommend this dress.,75233,4
75234,"Love the dress, my girls couldn't believe it came from Amazon",75234,4
75235,"The cut of the sleeves does not exactly match the picture, but it is not completely different.",75235,4
75235,The color is also slightly off (mine is just a little darker than pictured).,75235,4
75235,"I ordered the light gray in small (I am 5'2, 105lbs) and it fit well.",75235,4
75235,"I really like this shirt, and would purchase another product from this company.",75235,4
75236,I love the look of this swimsuit!,75236,4
75236,"The only thing I had an issue with is that they strings are very long so they tickle you back quite a bit, but so cute!",75236,4
75237,My grandson is 3 hat was a little large,75237,4
75238,"It's a nice hat I will say, it come only 12 days after I ordered it, so pretty good
However it was shipped in just a plastic bag, & because of that the hat is somewhat dented & awkward looking, but it is an appropriate for the price.",75238,4
75239,"i am 5'4"" and 135lb; these socks fit snugly and come up to mid thigh, stay put relatively well/with minimal slippage",75239,4
75240,These run a little small.,75240,4
75240,"I am usually a medium, and this still fits (I'm keeping it)...but I think I would have preferred a large.",75240,4
75241,It's exactly as I thought it would like like from the pictures.,75241,4
75241,"Fit perfect- I chose a Medium, 5'8 145 lbs.",75241,4
75243,"Finally, sunglasses that I can wear over my prescription glasses instead those ugly and heavy pair I'm using.",75243,4
75243,"They fit nicely and provide balanced shade; not too dark, or too bright.",75243,4
75243,"As far as protection from UV or other harmful radiation, I have no idea, for there is nothing on the glasses themselves to indicate such protection.",75243,4
75243,Amazon product detail page does not provide such information either.,75243,4
75243,"So, if you are concerned about that, I don't think this is for you.",75243,4
75243,I did not know about the fact that they do not provide any protection from harmful radiation until I purchased them.,75243,4
75245,My husband works on a towboat and is constantly getting his hands dirty.,75245,4
75245,We both decided on a tungsten ring and this one stood out the most.,75245,4
75245,"At a GREAT price and wonderful reviews, it impressed me!",75245,4
75245,It has continued to withstand a lot with few scratches!,75245,4
75245,It's just as good of quality as an 100 dollar one I could've gotten from Kays.,75245,4
75245,My hubby and I are thoroughly pleased with it!,75245,4
75245,And a year later it still looks good!,75245,4
75246,"Very soft material, love the colors.",75246,4
75247,"Super cute, runs small but fits.",75247,4
75247,Top looks kind of cheap but it was a good price.,75247,4
75248,In short I do like the swim suit and I plan to wear it.,75248,4
75248,It is a bit tight but I like my stuff tight and I can handle it because I'm small chested.,75248,4
75248,My measurements are 5'4'' 138 lbs.,75248,4
75248,and I am pear shaped with a small chest and larger bottom half and I got the Medium.,75248,4
75248,If you have a bigger chest you will have more issues because the torso is short so I'm stretching it and therefore it comes closer to not covering my nipples.,75248,4
75248,It's very sexy though definitely like the photo so you need to be well manicured.,75248,4
75248,Also because it's a stretch the white bands look stretched too.,75248,4
75248,It doesn't look bad you'll just have to adjust everything when it's on.,75248,4
75248,This swim suit also looks best on a flat stomach.,75248,4
75249,"The outfit looks great, but my son barely fit it when we got it.",75249,4
75249,He outgrew it within a month or two even though other cloths the same size still fit him really well.,75249,4
75250,I bought this for my 13 year old niece for Christmas.,75250,4
75250,I just rec'd it and have to say I think she will love it.,75250,4
75250,I love the message!!,75250,4
75250,My niece was being bullied at school and although it all has been resolved I know her self esteem took a hit.,75250,4
75250,I think this will be a reminder that she really is Braver than she believes and truly an over comer!!,75250,4
75251,It's nice and for the price was worth it.,75251,4
75252,The quality of bag is not the greatest though- I was expecting a heavier fabric.,75252,4
75253,"The straps sits very far on the shoulders, not in the middle, closer to the arms ( on top of that pointy bone almost at the edge of the shoulder) and gives the feeling that is going to slide.",75253,4
75253,"Other than that is a good, soft, supportive bra with a firm wide band.",75253,4
75254,i like the watch but had to have 4 links removed from the band and now it fits just right.,75254,4
75255,"Fits perfectly
And the print and material is really nice and perfect  for the spring weather",75255,4
75256,My daughter made Homecoming Court.,75256,4
75256,This dress was beautiful and stunning.,75256,4
75256,Great quality but the dress does run larger.,75256,4
75256,Don't go according to chart size.,75256,4
75256,Order your true size or order size smaller.,75256,4
75257,It is adjustable with a velcro strap in the back.,75257,4
75257,I normally wear a 7-5/8 and it fits well with strap to spare.,75257,4
75257,The hat is deeper than a normal round ball cap so I can pull it down to my eyebrows.,75257,4
75257,"The depth also makes it more resistant to wind, activity, and longer hair causing the back to slide up.",75257,4
75257,The slightly longer peak (bill) is good for additional shade from the Sun.,75257,4
75257,Cotton feels good against my forehead.,75257,4
75257,This may become my favorite grab-and-go hat on hot Summer days.,75257,4
75258,Really like the style and slimming material of this shirt.,75258,4
75258,It is versatile for work or play.,75258,4
75259,Really cute romper for the price!,75259,4
75259,Quality isn't the best but it's still cute and flattering,75259,4
75260,Fascinator arrived well packaged and in a timely manner.,75260,4
75260,"Very well constructed, fits comfortably on the head, and looks great on me.",75260,4
75260,"Comes with original tag of ""Something Special - Commerce, California,"" style number YH2501 and another tag that says it's 100% sinamay without trimming.",75260,4
75260,The reason why I gave this four stars instead of five is that the one I got though is more lavender/purple than the Barbie pink in the stock photos with the orchids and feathers also being more of the orchid/violet/amethyst hue which is unfortunate as I bought this with the intention of wearing it to Red Hat Society functions as a pink hatter.,75260,4
75260,"Overall, a beautiful fascinator which I'm sure to wear anyways for tea parties and for funsies, but don't expect the ""orchid"" one to be pink like in the picture.",75260,4
75260,"Honestly though, I would buy again because it is well constructed and a beautiful piece for the price I had paid.",75260,4
75260,"So if you are looking for an orchid colored fascinator of the violet/orchid/amethyst/lavender hues, this is the fascinator for you!",75260,4
75261,It was exactly what I wanted but was a little big.,75261,4
75261,"I wasn't sure what size to order, and I guessed wrong.",75261,4
75264,"For as inexpensive as they are, they're great!",75264,4
75264,"Clasp works well, and the gold shines nicely - not fake.",75264,4
75264,Good size too...not too big or small.,75264,4
75265,The blouse is good but was tight on the bust.,75265,4
75265,Can not risk keeping it due to the doubt it might shrink after wash.,75265,4
75265,The stichingbin the front is uneven.,75265,4
75265,One side is longer than the other.,75265,4
75265,My size is U.S L-XL and the fit will be good for ladies with smaller breast.,75265,4
75265,I am returning it but not because of its quality.,75265,4
75266,Material is very thing.,75266,4
75266,The style is nice.,75266,4
75266,The color is brilliant.,75266,4
75266,I love the green color.,75266,4
75266,"I'd say it's good value, but nothing t brag about.",75266,4
75267,love the dress  good fit,75267,4
75268,"VERY STRONG MATERIAL...
MET ALL EXPECTATIONS",75268,4
75270,Its a great robe to wear and I love the full zipper.,75270,4
75270,Easy to get in and out of this robe.,75270,4
75270,"Material a little heavier than expected and stiff but after washing, I'm sure it will be softer.",75270,4
75270,I always buy a larger size in robes so I have lots of room to move in around the house and also when I watching television for coverup.,75270,4
75271,Good quality just runs large...returned for smaller size...hope it will arrive soon,75271,4
75272,It was what we ordered!,75272,4
75272,perfect for the needed project,75272,4
75273,"Nothing fancy, nor fashion.",75273,4
75273,The material is kind of thin.,75273,4
75273,Perfect for summer time.,75273,4
75273,I bought it for playing golf under sun.,75273,4
75273,It covers my ears and back neck.,75273,4
75273,It serves the purpose.,75273,4
75273,"Based on the other reviews, I bought a XL.",75273,4
75273,"It is just a little bit big, but OK for me.",75273,4
75274,There is another seller trying to sell these with the same picture and they are AWFUL.,75274,4
75274,"This one however, fits as expected.",75274,4
75275,My daughter loved this it is very cute!,75275,4
75275,She wore it for her 6 year old mermaid birthday party.,75275,4
75275,However the tail was very very long and the bottom piece was ... Baggy!,75275,4
75275,I ordered a size down and found that it was the same size except the tip seemed a bit smaller.,75275,4
75275,We ended up making the tail smaller and she wore it anyway.,75275,4
75276,My daughter loves them.,75276,4
75277,"Bought for Maui, used by my daughters, great on hot sand.",75277,4
75277,Used with snorkeling fins.,75277,4
75277,She already had a sore on her toe from fin prior to using socks.,75277,4
75277,Helped a little to protect it from further damage.,75277,4
75278,Bought it as a gift and the response was good.,75278,4
75279,Gave it to a friend and they lived it...,75279,4
75282,It smelt when I pulled it out of the package so I washed it without putting it in the dryer.,75282,4
75282,The color was just as pictured very thick and warm.,75282,4
75282,Happy with this purchase.,75282,4
75283,only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it got dirty really fast and I can't find a way to get it shiny again!,75283,4
75283,I've tried severaly ways to clean it and it looks dull still but was shiny when it arrived,75283,4
75284,"Nice, and well made, but it avoids 5 stars because although it is fully functional it has an awkward fit",75284,4
75285,Nice and soft but a bit thinner and less spandexy than I hoped.,75285,4
75285,But looks nice under long tops.,75285,4
75286,"great shoes ,  i am a diabetic so  im careful .it is a great shoes",75286,4
75288,"This dress was of a similar quality I would have gotten in the dress shop, but half the cost.",75288,4
75288,"It fit well, was a great coral color and the beading was durable (and they even sent extra beads just in case).",75288,4
75288,"It was a  little hard to get the corset to stay together while trying to get the ribbon in, a button/snap to hold the back flap in place would have make it perfect.",75288,4
75288,"I used an iron at low setting  on it when we first received it, and the wrinkles came out without any problem,  My daughter got something on it at homecoming, and I was able to wash it on delicate (with some stain remover) and the stain came out, without messing the dress up at all.",75288,4
75288,"We tried several others like this sold on Amazon, and sent them back because they looked cheap or had flimsy beading.",75288,4
75288,This was the third dress we ordered.,75288,4
75289,"Fit great, washed nicely too.",75289,4
75290,Good quality and I love the gold flecks in the material.,75290,4
75290,"I'm 5'1"" 115 lbs and it is slightly big on me.",75290,4
75290,I don't quite fill out the sides enough but I'm still going to rock it.,75290,4
75291,Great looking shoes but it will be great if the y remove the button inside them can be uncomfortable for the kid ti wear,75291,4
75292,"has no padding in the top, lovely colors!",75292,4
75293,"If I had more time before Halloween, I would've been able to make a better vest for my husband's costume, but it worked.",75293,4
75294,This was actually cute unlike a lot of the other shirts of this type that I bought on amazon.,75294,4
75294,I took off one star because the hem looks a bit uneven in the front.,75294,4
75295,I'm very happy with this comfy sweater!,75295,4
75295,"Works great with a nice pair of leggings, instead of wearing he usual baggy pants and top.",75295,4
75295,Thanks for helping me change my style a bit.,75295,4
75296,"I'm happy with this Butt Lifter it does the job, i order a Size a Size 2XLARGE I Wear A Size 16 and i have thick thigs.",75296,4
75296,"FITS SMALL 
I should've order a 3XLARGE ..",75296,4
75296,It's Tight N The only reason i dint give this a 5 star is because it doesn't do much of a tummy control...,75296,4
75297,I have always used this type of panty hose.,75297,4
75297,I like the way they fit.,75297,4
75298,Great until the stones slowly fell out.,75298,4
75299,It's cute but a bit small and short.,75299,4
75299,The fabric has a good  quality.,75299,4
75300,Super comfortable and soft.,75300,4
75300,"It runs a little large, but that's what I expected.",75300,4
75301,"cheap but a great piece for the price , I wear it a lot :-)",75301,4
75302,The packing cubes are smaller than what I expected.,75302,4
75302,But I packed my shirts in a rolled up fashion and it worked out well.,75302,4
75302,"For a large bag, buy two of these!",75302,4
75303,"Such a lovely print, genuinely.",75303,4
75303,"I will order more...however, some adjustments will have to be made...for instance I will replace the elastic in the waist, and add to the slip on the bottom underneath .",75303,4
75303,"Many people wouldn't feel the need to add to the  slip but I think some would want to adjust the elastic simply because it is for a small waist, however, the absolutely lovely print and price make up for the tweaks.",75303,4
75303,I'm a huge fan of floral and this print is hard to find.,75303,4
75303,Again I may order two more just to have a backup in case anything happens to the first I bought.,75303,4
75304,"Very nice for the price, I bout it for my 3 year old and she really likes it.",75304,4
75305,A strong smell but well made,75305,4
75306,I'm very pleased with the cut of the dress.,75306,4
75306,Just as light and airy as depicted.,75306,4
75308,This was a birthday present for an 11 year old.,75308,4
75308,Hat was a bit too large but he loves it,75308,4
75309,"It is beautiful, and came faster than expected.",75309,4
75309,"The chain itself does feel a little fragile, but other than that it is very pretty!",75309,4
75310,Daughter loves the scarf.,75310,4
75310,Gave it 4 stars because there is actually a hole in the product.,75310,4
75310,"Since the scarf's design already has holes, it was not an issue.",75310,4
75310,However it is disappointing to get a new product and it have a defect.,75310,4
75311,What can I say...I'm a spanx fan...never disappointed...,75311,4
75312,It's smaller than it looks.,75312,4
75313,"great necklace, love it",75313,4
75314,Ive ordered five pairs of these so far.,75314,4
75314,The first two came in perfect but ine of the three i just ordered came with a small hole in it(see picture) not i big deal i fixed it myself with a needle and some thread I had.,75314,4
75314,No problems other than that,75314,4
75315,I really liked the material and style.,75315,4
75315,The straps have a bit of elastic for bigger ankles and a zipper in the back.,75315,4
75315,It did feel awkward to put it on wide feet.,75315,4
75316,"There over all super comfy, but i didn't the pink pair only the one with all there faces on it, i di have 3 pairs but i just didn't get the pink pair.",75316,4
75317,He loves it !,75317,4
75317,The first day he refused to take off,75317,4
75318,It was bought in a hurry to replace a gift that was ordered and came in damaged.,75318,4
75318,It was a very good substitute and I wish I had ordered it originally.,75318,4
75319,Fits perfect quality is good,75319,4
75320,The quality was good and the rise was great.,75320,4
75320,I am between a medium and a large and didn't want them to be too tight.,75320,4
75320,I should have gone with the medium as the large was too big.,75320,4
75321,Came within a week.,75321,4
75321,I am very petite and the bottoms fit me just right.,75321,4
75321,The top could have more padding/coverage but it's still a great suit for the price.,75321,4
75322,Great quality although I wish there were another muted tie to replace the white one,75322,4
75323,I'm a runner in Minnesota....this was the perfect purchase for the winter!,75323,4
75324,Comfortable and good for the price.,75324,4
75325,Brother-in-law loved the shirt.,75325,4
75327,Ordered a size up as the reviews said to do and it fits.,75327,4
75327,Lots of padding in the top which I like.,75327,4
75328,The little bit of stretch makes them very comfortable.,75328,4
75329,My product arrived on time and  I love it!,75329,4
75329,I didn't follow the size guide.,75329,4
75329,"I opted to use my shirt size, which is large.",75329,4
75329,It's comfortable and I've even worn it on a long rode trip.,75329,4
75331,warmest costume I have ever worn.,75331,4
75331,"If the power ever goes out in the dead of winter, I know I have the tigger costume to rely upon for warmth!",75331,4
75333,"I accidentally ordered two of these suits, which ended up being very eye opening as they both fit COMPLETELY different, even though they were both size L. The one I kept was made and sewn much more generously, allowing for extra room in the butt.",75333,4
75333,"One was ""very cheeky"" (shown in pic) and one was straight up a thong.",75333,4
75333,The tops were also cut very different.,75333,4
75333,"One was much tighter, and had smaller cups.",75333,4
75333,"Had I only gotten the one, I would have returned it.",75333,4
75333,The one I kept I am VERY happy with.,75333,4
75333,"The solid side is red NOT pink, but the printed side is a really pretty green and pink paisley.",75333,4
75333,"This suit is definitely ""Asian sizing"".",75333,4
75333,"I am a size M in Victoria secret, a size 8 in Lulu, 145/50, 5'5, 36D.",75333,4
75333,"My suggestion to all, and my new MO, is order two if there's free returns,",75333,4
75334,"These worked temporarily for me, and fit perfectly.",75334,4
75334,"Unfortunately, the arch support wasn't quite enough.",75334,4
75334,"After about a month of wearing them, my feet started pressing inward again, and I began to have pain in my large toes.",75334,4
75336,"Good quality, looks and value.",75336,4
75337,They ripped my first time wearing them but besides that I liked them.,75337,4
75339,Looks very nice but the wristband could be better quality.,75339,4
75339,But for the price its worth it.,75339,4
75340,Should order a small size.,75340,4
75342,Super comfy and easy to wear.,75342,4
75342,"My only problem is I noticed after the first wash (in a garment bag), on of the seams was starting to separate.",75342,4
75342,I will be hand washing from now on,75342,4
75343,"it's a very cute bag, thought it had more pockets, but big enough to put ""stuff"" in.",75343,4
75344,It looks nice and the top fit nicely but the bottoms were to tight,75344,4
75345,Got here much faster than estimated!,75345,4
75345,Very cute and quirky.,75345,4
75345,A little heavy but well made.,75345,4
75345,Very happy with them.,75345,4
75346,It is a nice Anima fox costume.,75346,4
75346,"(kind of cartoonish), but it fits well, is soft and comfortable, doesn't look bad, or look cheap.",75346,4
75346,"It looks big on him then, but I ordered it several months ago and now he fits perfectly.",75346,4
75346,Wife said I made a good guess this time and to never blindly guess purchase something 6 months in advance again.,75346,4
75346,"(Edit: the first set of images keep rotating after I upload them, so sorry about that.",75346,4
75346,"not sure why they don't allow for rotating after uploading, but they still work.",75346,4
75346,Here are a few of the only pictures taken during Halloween.,75346,4
75346,"Update 6 months after the first dress test: Halloween
It was a bit hot after a few hours of tick or treating at our church, so I had to unzip it at one point too keep him cool.",75346,4
75346,Other wise he loved it and had a blast.,75346,4
75346,"he isn't a fan of things on his head, but he oddly kept it on  and would whine a little when he couldn't get it back over his head on his own.",75346,4
75346,"In call, I thought this was a win.",75346,4
75346,The anima fox for the win.,75346,4
75347,The tank top is super cute.,75347,4
75347,The coloring is bright and the anchor on the front is well placed.,75347,4
75347,The bow on the back was hanging down on the sides a bit so I put a small stitch on each end to attach the sides.,75347,4
75347,I have worn it a couple times and it has held up pretty well.,75347,4
75347,"I did notice after the third wash, there is a small area by the armpit where the stitching is coming undone.",75347,4
75347,It won't take much to see it back together.,75347,4
75348,Once i get my tummy a little tighter it will fit great but it is a little tight!,75348,4
75350,"My boyfriend really, really liked this lol
The stockings and thong were a bit tight but im a bit thick in the back and in the thighs.",75350,4
75350,The hat also isn't as flat as I would have liked.,75350,4
75350,But for the price you can't beat it!,75350,4
75351,It comes with pads inside for if people want to wear it without a bra but these are so ridiculously small and close together they'd only fit an A cup.,75351,4
75351,But the pads are removable (thank god) so I tossed them and wear it without them.,75351,4
75351,I got the white and the color was awesome and the fabric is a nice pattern of lace.,75351,4
75351,Would buy again :),75351,4
75352,"i am not sure what odor other people refer to, but mine didn't smell, at least not as bad as the others.",75352,4
75352,"if i got my nose really close, i could smell a ""plastic"" type smell, but the odor certainly wasn't overwhelming.",75352,4
75352,the zippers work just fine for me.,75352,4
75352,"the inside lining of the compartments seem a little cheap to me, but the outside looks just as pictured (i got the dark blue).",75352,4
75352,"the only issue i had, which is personal preference, but i wish it was softer.",75352,4
75352,"it's not super hard, but it almost feels like a plastic leather to me.",75352,4
75352,"feels too much like leather boots, and i'd prefer a more soft leather.",75352,4
75352,"that's why i docked a star, but that just me.",75352,4
75353,"It's a nice width ( overall around wrist)  a ""bit"" thin height wise, but it is in the description, so it's not misleading.",75353,4
75353,The wording is still readable and it has a nice dainty look.,75353,4
75354,I didn't like the color .,75354,4
75355,It is a very pretty dress!,75355,4
75355,It is perfect to dress ip or down for any occasion.,75355,4
75355,"However, this dress is not meant for busty women.",75355,4
75355,I am a 34D and i ordered a large and it was tight around the chest area!,75355,4
75355,I would reccomend for smaller chested women looking for a nice dress!,75355,4
75355,Perfect for a date night wedding or special ocassion!,75355,4
75356,"Had my doubts, but decent product",75356,4
75357,This is a decent size and looks professional!,75357,4
75357,"It even came with a re-sealable plastic case for storage, which is nice since since I plan on travelling with it.",75357,4
75357,"Downside is the backing is cardboard; it's sturdy, but I probably wouldn't put too much weight on it OR leave it near liquids~",75357,4
75358,"Bought this for my wife, and as some have stated it is not super sturdy.",75358,4
75358,"For example, she has a coat that has tight elastic wristbands and it got caught a little when she took it off and one of the rings in the clasp opened up.",75358,4
75358,Easy fix with some pliers.,75358,4
75358,"However, it looks great and as long as your just wearing it (not trying to build a deck or repair a sink) you should be fine.",75358,4
75359,It's for a person with a small neck; it fits perfectly on my junior bridesmaid!,75359,4
75361,I love the way this necklace sparkles when it catches the light and it's a great size and length.,75361,4
75361,It's very very light which was unexpected but doesn't feel cheap.,75361,4
75361,It's a very pleasant surprise because I was worried it might be heavy based on the dimensions.,75361,4
75361,My only concerns are that it did arrive a little scratched.,75361,4
75361,The red surface has a few spots but they aren't very noticeable and for the price; it's worth it.,75361,4
75361,The chain and gold casing are actually bronze.,75361,4
75361,They are much darker than expected but again; it's a gorgeous necklace.,75361,4
75361,I'm very happy with it and will continue to wear it and love it.,75361,4
75361,Was worth the purchase.,75361,4
75362,"bigger than I expected, constructed well...will use it for a gift",75362,4
75363,"Not as thick as I would like for a sweatshirt, but looks good, and fits good.",75363,4
75363,I'm sure it will shrink some after a was so I would buy a size larger.,75363,4
75364,"Was a little small, but beautiful.",75364,4
75365,"I was afraid they wouldn't come in time, they were a present.",75365,4
75365,"They did, very cute, very warm.",75365,4
75367,"This robe puts me in mind of the old ""Elvis"" and ""Jesus"" velour paintings.",75367,4
75367,The material is soft and light weight.,75367,4
75367,"It's very shiny material, not quite the classier look I see in the picture.",75367,4
75367,"The red is very Coca Cola-can bright red and the white areas (especially in the roses) makes the contrast a bit more ""startling.""",75367,4
75367,"This robe/gown all but screams ""Made in China.""",75367,4
75367,Looks well made though.,75367,4
75367,The black area is heavy and stiff (satiny ribbon texture).,75367,4
75367,That might be more preferred as it holds the gown to a shape it would definitely not have due to the thin and soft texture of the velour.,75367,4
75367,The gown tag says 100% polyester.,75367,4
75367,"I don't see that as a con, though.",75367,4
75367,The gown meets my criteria.,75367,4
75367,"I wanted something with a zipper, that covered well for a fall trip.",75367,4
75367,"The length is just a tad shorter than I would have liked and I'm 5'6.""",75367,4
75367,That could be a plus to some people who don't want floor length.,75367,4
75367,It hits me right about top ankle.,75367,4
75367,"That being said, I wasn't looking for beauty so much as coverage and functionality.",75367,4
75367,You can definitely wad this up in a ball and crush in a suitcase and pop it out at your destination without a wrinkle in sight.,75367,4
75367,"For what I wanted, I would recommend.",75367,4
75367,But it isn't as pretty as it looks in the picture.,75367,4
75368,They are nice to have.,75368,4
75369,The black dye starts wearing off fairly quickly,75369,4
75371,I am pleased with this purse!,75371,4
75371,I get a lot of compliments!!!,75371,4
75372,This looks just like the photos and feels fairly well made.,75372,4
75372,"The fleece is a little stiff and on the cheaper side, and the fabric actually squeaks a bit when I move.",75372,4
75372,"Weird I know, but it does.",75372,4
75372,"It seems like it will probably soften up once washed, but I will let it dry flat because I think it will probably shrink and there is no room for that!",75372,4
75372,"I went up one size, but should have gone 2.",75372,4
75372,"It fits, but it is a little snug around the bottom and I would prefer a looser fit.",75372,4
75372,I still like it and will wear it (wearing it today actually).,75372,4
75372,It arrived 3 weeks earlier than expected too.,75372,4
75374,bought this for my daughter for Christmas the chain has with stand.,75374,4
75374,it is a nice size neckless and looks just as it does on here,75374,4
75375,"Ordered for someone else, who really likes the product",75375,4
75376,Good socks but wish they were just a bit longer and had a heel,75376,4
75377,Nice looking and fit nice,75377,4
75378,Nice suit but the top would only handle an A and B cup size.,75378,4
75381,The only complaint that I would have about this product is that it needs away to lock so that it doesn't open in your pocket,75381,4
75382,don't like how it looks like the lace is coming off but i love the shirt,75382,4
75383,They don't seem to stay on baby's feet that well though.,75383,4
75385,Cute gift for the caffienated nerd in your life.,75385,4
75386,"Very very nice, super happy and planning to order more.",75386,4
75387,color is more green than blue but is still nice,75387,4
75388,"Aside from a stiff, and slightly awkward to use at first, zipper; this is a fantastic coat.",75388,4
75388,"I followed the advice of previous purchasers of this coat and order a few sizes larger than I'd normally wear, and it fits me quite nicely.",75388,4
75388,"Luckily this jacket arrived just as a large rain storm did, so I got to test it out (this October has been the wetest one in my neck of the woods in a century, or so says the local news).",75388,4
75388,"Suffice to say, I was kept warm and toasty!",75388,4
75388,"I appreciate all the zippered pockets, the ample hood, and the soft micro fleece lining.",75388,4
75388,"Something the description didn't mention is that the chest pockets both have a d-ring to attach keys to as well as a smaller pen pocket in each, and that all the pockets (save for the one on the left cuff and the one on the small of the back) have a nice port you can thread your headphone cable through...",75388,4
75388,Overall I am both impressed and satisfied with this jacket.,75388,4
75389,Somewhat small for average sized calves but look super cute.,75389,4
75391,"This shirt runs a bit small,  but I love everything else about it.",75391,4
75392,"Love it, looks good fits great!",75392,4
75393,Decent hat :) bought it to add to my 60th Disney celebration collection,75393,4
75394,These sunglasses are just perfect.,75394,4
75394,"Amazing price point, the polarization is awesome, they look stylish, and feel comfy, my only complaint is they are actually a little too dark at times!",75394,4
75394,"Otherwise, a perfect purchase, especially at this price point!",75394,4
75395,"It fit nicely, but I was expecting it to be more fitted and cinched like the one I got from another company...No, I was not trying to suffocate, I just wanted my waist to be a little more ""snatched'....But, it fit nicely under my clothing and you couldn't see the hooks.",75395,4
75396,Good fit tho a bit large.,75396,4
75396,"Great pattern, good weight to fabric.",75396,4
75396,Will get lots of wear.,75396,4
75397,Kinda short (im 5'5) and the neck isn't as high up as the picture but its still a very cute dress.,75397,4
75398,I love the crisp clean lines & feel of this product.,75398,4
75398,My only concern is for the interior dividers and there longevity given lots of use.,75398,4
75399,Love the color; I wear these all the time.,75399,4
75400,My husband loves it!,75400,4
75400,I didn't give it all 5 states because the edges are starting to frey already but he is very hard on his wallets.,75400,4
75401,"Not sure how protective the case is, but it is adorable for the price.",75401,4
75402,I absolutely loved the color (hi-liter yellow) of these leggings.,75402,4
75402,"Unfortunately, I had to return them because there was a line running down the front right leg of the leggings.",75402,4
75402,"If that flaw had not been there, I definitely would have kept them.",75402,4
75403,"I like my skirt extender, but it is different than pictured.",75403,4
75403,I was just telling someone who commented on it today that the one I thought I ordered has a more lace-like detail at the bottom (as pictured).,75403,4
75403,The one they sent has several rows of ruffles and do not resemble the lace-like bottom in the picture.,75403,4
75403,"It is cute, it fits nicely and I like it, but it is not the product pictured.",75403,4
75404,As advertised but a bit small.,75404,4
75405,"Nice pendant, my only wish is that it would have been a bigger size in diameter.",75405,4
75407,"It's slightly curved out, and the back of it doesn't have the same wood-looking design as the front.",75407,4
75407,One of the small rings broke once and I almost lost it.,75407,4
75408,Really beautiful but way too small.,75408,4
75408,Order up at least a size.,75408,4
75409,"very pretty, colorful dress.",75409,4
75410,It is a great length and weight for snowy winters in michigan.,75410,4
75411,Buy at least two sizes bigger.,75411,4
75411,I wear medium and I bought a large and it was still a little small.,75411,4
75411,The zipper get caught a lot so be careful when zipping up and down.,75411,4
75411,It does keep me very warm just wished I'd bought a bigger size.,75411,4
75412,"Ok for just cards, putting cash in is a minor annoyance.",75412,4
75414,I love the shape & the color!,75414,4
75414,The arm holes are a tad big.,75414,4
75414,I'll have to take it in at the shoulders.,75414,4
75414,Got lots of compliments.,75414,4
75414,Over all- a keeper!,75414,4
75415,I'm a size 10-12 and the jacket fits perfectly as described.,75415,4
75415,It is shorter than the pic though.,75415,4
75416,"Love it but, was not what I expected.",75416,4
75416,The crosha is hard and no flex to it.,75416,4
75416,"Like it but, will not buy again.",75416,4
75417,"Not to die for, but ok.",75417,4
75418,It fits great but has a strange smell when first arrived.,75418,4
75418,I'm sure it's the fresh ink on it!,75418,4
75421,material is not as good as I expected.,75421,4

75422,"I ordered the dark gray one, and the color is slightly darker in the picture.",75422,4
75422,I'm 5 foot 8 and I ordered a large and it fits perfectly.,75422,4
75422,"The arm length is longer which I love, and it's not too short.",75422,4
75422,"However, the sweatshirt is thin, but I like to wear layers.",75422,4
75424,"Very uncomfortable at first, and took quite a while to wear in.",75424,4
75424,"They're still a little tight, especially on the tops of my feet, but they did get better after a few weeks.",75424,4
75424,"They're not bad, but I probably won't be buying another pair.",75424,4
75425,This ring is comfortable and the sizes accurate.,75425,4
75426,It is really soft on the skin.,75426,4
75426,I find the fabric a little too thin for what I like to use it for.,75426,4
75426,I still ordered another one because the manufacturer has a beautiful dark green.,75426,4
75429,"The color of this dress was supposed to be ""aqua.""",75429,4
75429,"It is more green than aqua, but still a lovely dress.",75429,4
75429,Better quality than I expected at this price.,75429,4
75429,I bought this dress in a size Large.,75429,4
75429,"I am a usual dress size 14, at  5' 7"" and 165 pounds with a ""D"" bust, and this dress fits great!",75429,4
75429,"It is stretchy, so I think it might fit a larger size too.",75429,4
75429,"Length is fine, maxi dress length.",75429,4
75430,A little bigger than I expected.,75430,4
75430,They don't fit a 1 month old.,75430,4
75430,But the fabric is cute and they will fit eventually!,75430,4
75431,It requires a camisole.,75431,4
75432,I loved wearing it.,75432,4
75433,My wife totally LOVEs this necklace I got her as a gift.,75433,4
75433,She loves dolphins so when I saw this I had to get it.,75433,4
75433,"Since then, she wears it a lot.",75433,4
75433,The stone in the middle is quality and sparkles like a blue diamond.,75433,4
75433,The silver is real and quality has held up well.,75433,4
75433,This think just shines and look stunning on her neck.,75433,4
75433,She is beautiful in it!,75433,4
75433,I would recommend any man looking to buy his GF or spouse a gift to highly consider this one.,75433,4
75433,"For the price, its well worth it to have a super happy spouse love you more when you give it to them.",75433,4
75434,The top fits perfect the bottom fits a little large that you can see her private when she sits down.,75434,4
75434,She is 3 years 4 months old,75434,4
75436,Very comfy and stylish.,75436,4
75436,The material is a little thin but cool I'm always hot.,75436,4
75437,It looks  right,75437,4
75438,So far it has been pretty good.,75438,4
75438,I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars since I've only worn it for 3 days.,75438,4
75438,Let's see if it does what I hope it will do in the next month.,75438,4
75439,A little smaller than expected.,75439,4
75440,Nice simple ring.....they appear to run a half size too small.,75440,4
75441,"Love the color, sparkle and size.",75441,4
75441,"Also, the top zipper works fine which is very important to me.",75441,4
75441,Only gave 4 stars as I noticed some of the gold threads are in danger of coming loose.,75441,4
75441,"Fixed that with spraying clear FlexSeal, first on the bottom, to see if the color changes, and then sprayed lightly both sides of the bag.",75441,4
75441,Looks good and solid.,75441,4
75441,Haven't used the bag yet but am confident it will last.,75441,4
75443,I wear it almost everyday for at least 5-8 hrs,75443,4
75444,It is actually shorter and stiffer than I expected but that may be all in my expectations instead of the actual product.,75444,4
75446,"The wiring inside is somewhat cumbersome, but it's a good sweater.",75446,4
75448,Beautiful headpiece for a great price!,75448,4
75449,"It's good material and I didn't notice any sewing issues like some others have posted, and it actually looks just like the models picture, except bigger.",75449,4
75449,It fit like a dress on me except for the slit on the sides coming too high for that.,75449,4
75449,"I would recommend, just order down!",75449,4
75450,A great accessory for a tie.,75450,4
75451,"For the price, this top is great!",75451,4
75451,It's definitely cheaply made but it fits me perfectly and looks really cute with my high waisted jeans and skirts.,75451,4
75451,I'm thinking about buying more in different colors!,75451,4
75452,"They're great, only complaint being that they're super small...",75452,4
75452,"But that's my fault, I didn't look at them very well.",75452,4
75453,"Slightly large in circumference, and a tad short for a girl my height (5'10"") but overall a quality product.",75453,4
75454,Product came quickly and matches the description and picture perfectly.,75454,4
75454,Made for a great gift for my daughter.,75454,4
75455,I ordered a size up and am glad that I did -- little tight-fitting.,75455,4
75456,Nice summer weight hat,75456,4
75458,Really like the onesie--color & design are great.,75458,4
75458,Only disappointment is the design fades quickly with washing--and baby clothes tend to get washed a lot.,75458,4
75458,"I would still buy again, her brothers love Dino's.",75458,4
75459,Always falls down the shoulder but I personally don't mind.,75459,4

75462,Fit great and loved outfit,75462,4
75463,I like it im 5'3 and its actually not long long its just good with some flats.,75463,4
75463,I was 1% dissapointed  its not white white it has like 5% pearl in it but its ok i guess.,75463,4
75463,I love how the shape is but next time i buy ill buy a size bigger to be comfy.,75463,4
75464,Had to order a size larger just fyi.,75464,4
75464,Only problem was when i got it it had a seem that wasn't sewn on the the shoulder so it showed the stuffing.,75464,4
75464,I had no problem returning it.,75464,4
75465,"Every pair isn't exactly the same, some of the socks feel a little small.",75465,4
75465,"That being said, every pair was usable for me and they look great too.",75465,4
75466,Got the powdered pink and it was still see through.,75466,4

75468,I purchased the 12-18 months size and it fit well.,75468,4
75468,Not huge by any means.,75468,4
75468,It's a bit tricky to get on a baby without any snaps near the crotch area.,75468,4
75468,"However, he looked really cute in it.",75468,4
75469,I've had this necklace for about 2 years now and it's such an amazing piece to wear.,75469,4

75469,It really looks great in fall and spring seasons!,75469,4
75470,Nice looking shoe just too small,75470,4
75471,"It's really not that ""long"", but it is pretty.",75471,4
75471,Not quite as dark as pictured but nice contrasting cool tones.,75471,4
75472,It has withstood my daily wear while dog walking all day.,75472,4
75472,Being summer I can get sweaty and the stainless steel had withstood the test.,75472,4
75472,UPDATED:  Sadly the clasp has tarnished.,75472,4
75472,Two months into wearing it.,75472,4
75473,Perfect for typing  in a cold office building.,75473,4
75474,My 6-year old is very happy with it.,75474,4
75474,But he will probably outgrow within a year or so.,75474,4
75475,I wasn't able to get a Chinese to NA comparison size.,75475,4
75475,"Well live and learn, next imported shirt I purchase I have a rough idea what size I need.",75475,4
75476,I'm not sure yea,75476,4
75477,Fits my lumia 640.,75477,4
75477,The buttons are a little harder to push though.,75477,4
75477,Also I dropped my phone and the case flew open and my phone hit the pavement face down.,75477,4
75477,It's still ok but that was scary.,75477,4
75477,I might add my own stronger magnet to the closure now though.,75477,4
75478,I bought according to my size and it's a tad big in the waist and a little too long.,75478,4
75478,But I've gotten so many compliments on it.,75478,4
75479,Bought larger size cause i knew chinese sizes run small,75479,4

75483,"I take extra clothes, tanning stuff, and all sorts of other stuff in it.",75483,4
75483,At least it's kind of an original type gym bag.,75483,4
75483,I got my sister one at the same time and had it sent to her.,75483,4
75483,"she's a nurse and uses it to take her things, lunch exsetra to work.",75483,4

75485,"It is a really cute hat, it lights up easily and looks great!",75485,4
75486,"The silver plug was slightly larger than the other two, making it a bit difficult to get in.",75486,4
75487,"We liked the sweat shirt- it is good quality, but it was too small.",75487,4
75487,We had difficulty understanding how to choose the size based on Japanese sizing- and the advice we got did not help.,75487,4
75488,The material is very nice and stretchy.,75488,4
75488,"The top feels great to wear, but it is a bit short.",75488,4
75488,"It isn't horrible and if you have the right body size for it you'll be fine, but if you have a long torso or chest, it may not fit very well.",75488,4
75489,Great fit and they look terrific.,75489,4
75490,"exactly what I wanted, nice feeling fabric",75490,4
75491,Comfy breathable fit for a 10 - 12 American fit,75491,4
75492,"Bought a medium and it was perfect for my 35"" waist and 40"" hips as a size 6",75492,4
75493,Bracelet is very nice.,75493,4
75493,Only problem is that the crystals fall off if they catch on something.,75493,4
75495,I just got it today!,75495,4
75495,"I'm a size medium, out of the box it feels slightly small, however it loosens up over time and fits well.",75495,4
75495,"I'm very pleased how light (4 oz) and breathable this hat is, compared to the western straw hats I had in the past.",75495,4
75495,You can tell the weight differences.,75495,4
75495,Seagrass is something I never seen before in the Northwest either.,75495,4
75495,"The color is oat colored, not quite as light in the picture.",75495,4
75495,"Form looks good, just like the picture.",75495,4
75495,I noticed in the comments that there was some fabric underneath the brim.,75495,4
75495,"My hat didn't come with that and I thought it was worth mentionOverall, I like it!",75495,4
75496,I feel like I got more than I paid for with the mask.,75496,4
75496,Details were good......except being able to see very well in the dark while trick or treating.,75496,4
75496,Also no venting so it gets pretty hot in there quick.,75496,4
75496,I'd still buy it again if I had to do it over again.,75496,4
75497,I read a lot of reviews before buying this suit.,75497,4
75497,"I was worried by all the people who said it runs crazy small, and even more worried by those who said it's totally see through.",75497,4
75497,"I just received my suit, immediately put it on, and am pleasantly relieved.",75497,4
75497,"I'm 5'11, and typically a size 12 in pants and a medium or large in tops, so I bought a size large in this.",75497,4
75497,"The bottoms fit exactly as I'd hope they would, although I'd prefer they be a little higher rise.",75497,4
75497,"The top fits nicely, although slightly large for my small chest, but that's just my lot in life.",75497,4
75497,I would never expect a $12 swimsuit to look exactly the same in real life on my real life body as it does in that picture of that models body.,75497,4
75497,But I am happy with this one and I recommend it to any like-minded cheap skates with love handles to hide.,75497,4
75500,I absolutely love mermaids so this purchase was a no brainer for me.,75500,4
75500,"The size of the pendant and the length of the chain are perfect, and the slide large enough that I can use a different chain if I'd like.",75500,4
75500,My only issue is with the pendant itself.,75500,4
75500,"The pictures make the pendant look almost carved (maybe it's just my perception), but in reality it is an image with a glass dome over it.",75500,4
75500,I was looking for more interest and dimension from this necklace and was disappointed when I didn't get it.,75500,4
75500,Overall it is pretty and I enjoy wearing it.,75500,4
75501,I bought this so I would have something cool to wear while I was putting on my makeup.,75501,4
75501,It is actually very nice.,75501,4
75501,"I have thyroid problems, so last year, I went down to  6/8, but I lost mostly muscle.",75501,4
75501,"This year I gained weight, and now am a 12/14, and a roly poly looking 12/14 at that.",75501,4
75501,"I wanted this to be loose, so I sized up to a 1x.",75501,4
75501,"Well, it is loose, but I believe if I wanted it a little tighter, the Large would be fine.",75501,4
75501,"It drapes really well, and the gathers at the top are just enough to cover my stomach, yet still not look like a tent.",75501,4
75501,"It is not 100% cotton, but rather a blend, but still feels pretty cottony.",75501,4
75501,"It did not pill, shrink, or get scratchy when I washed it.",75501,4
75501,The color is very attractive and should complement most skin tones.,75501,4
75501,"Really, I was surprised at how well this is made and recommend it.",75501,4
75502,"If you're looking for a custom made dress, they can help.",75502,4

75503,Wish they had more floral suites.,75503,4
75505,Nice beach cover up,75505,4
75507,I love the colors and the flexibility of the barbell.,75507,4
75507,"A few of the barbells were difficult to tighten the ball, but eventually the threading smoothed out and now they work without a hitch!",75507,4
75509,Nice item for the price.,75509,4
75509,"Does not include a power cord, which I wish I'd noticed, but it only takes 3 AAs so it's not a big deal as far as I'm concerned.",75509,4
75509,Arrived before expected delivery date.,75509,4
75510,"I am 5'3"", 126lbs, 34B, 25"", 37"" and ordered a large.",75510,4
75510,"The dress fits loose in my midsection, but it's very short!",75510,4
75510,It reaches just below my bum so I keep this dress limited to beach days/nights.,75510,4
75510,"Other than that, I love the fun print and it's very comfy.",75510,4
75511,These were great for the water and our little guy loved them for swim lessons.,75511,4
75512,"Arch support / heel, and sole are very comfortable",75512,4
75513,This swimsuit is super cute!,75513,4
75513,"I bought it a size bigger than I normally wear and it's still a little tighter than I expected, so order 1-2 sizes larger than your normal dress size.",75513,4
75513,The color is beautiful and it is very flattering.,75513,4
75514,it was a bit small other than that it was great,75514,4
75516,"I'm fairly tall and lean (6'0, 160lbs), so costumes like these can be difficult to size.",75516,4
75516,"I went with a medium, and it fit really well.",75516,4
75516,The sleeves and legs were more than long enough.,75516,4
75516,"Like most Halloween costumes, it's obviously made to be worn once or twice, but looks great and I highly recommend.",75516,4
75517,"Very please for the price, especially for a one time use for Halloween.",75517,4
75518,I bought two of these and one of them was perfect.,75518,4
75518,The second one has glue where is should be soft and fuzzy and scratched the glasses.,75518,4
75518,I would highly recommend that you put your hand in the check it out so your glasses don't get ruined.,75518,4
75519,This is very sexy ... Have it 4 stars because the top fits perfect but the short just a little loose in the waist,75519,4
75520,"Lvoe the color and fabric, but it is slightly large.",75520,4
75520,Should have gotten a size small.,75520,4
75521,I bought this as a gift for an 8 year old girl.,75521,4
75521,The chain length was perfect for her.,75521,4
75521,"It arrived a bit snarled in the package dice it doesn't ship in any type of jewelry case, just a plastic bag.",75521,4
75521,"But, overall, it was perfect for her.",75521,4
75522,"I have only two small concerns: The dress was very wrinkled and difficult to flatten out, and the fabric over the bust was not very stiff, so slid slightly during wear, showing the sides of my strapless bra.",75522,4
75522,"A small amount of fashion tape kept it in place, or wearing a bra with slightly less coverage would resolve it as well.",75522,4
75522,"It was beautiful, fit perfectly, and easy to put on and take off.",75522,4
75523,Looks fantastic but is SO thin... more like a thin shirt vs an outdoor garment,75523,4
75524,I bought a med the first time and they were huge.,75524,4
75524,I have normal size female hands.,75524,4
75524,I had no problems returning them and getting a small they fit great.,75524,4
75524,I haven't used them yet but they are very warm.,75524,4
75525,I am a 36 C and I ordered the D and absolutely could NOT go any smaller.,75525,4
75526,Very cute but runs small,75526,4
75527,"I loved the creative setting, but not for long.",75527,4
75527,The center stone and some of side crystals fell out on my second time of wearing it.,75527,4
75528,These are so comfy!,75528,4
75528,I'm 5'3 so they are a little longer than a normal Capri length but other than that I love them!,75528,4
75529,It is a good fit for my oakleys that i unfortunately scratched up.,75529,4
75529,So this was a much mor affordale option compared to the replacements directly from oakley.,75529,4
75530,However it says that it is pink and I think that it is ORANGE not pink...,75530,4
75530,I sent it back and kept the black one which I really like and wore to play tennis in today....,75530,4
75530,The reason for 4 stars is because I think that the color is off in it's description...,75530,4
75530,Otherwise it's a great fitting top.,75530,4
75531,I give it a 4 star rating only because the sizing is very difficult to guess.,75531,4
75531,"My child is almost 3 years old and he usually wears a size of a 4 year old kid, so I bought size 4 and it nearly fits him.",75531,4
75531,"Otherwise the material is soft, the colors and vivid.",75531,4
75533,I really need to buy another set of leg warmers.,75533,4
75533,"They are a bit too tight for my baby's mighty thighs, but it makes late night and bedtime diaper changes so much faster.",75533,4
75533,I use the extra material to put over her feet up to her toes.,75533,4
75533,That way she keeps warm and I don't have to wrap a thick blanket around her at night.,75533,4
75533,"Yes it can get a little Jane Fonda as far as looks, but you can't argue that these things are so practical.",75533,4
75534,"I will admit that I didn't look at the dimensions prior to ordering... a lot bigger than expected, but still a great product.",75534,4
75535,This case really didn't fit any of my 32C bras in the compartment.,75535,4
75535,"It squished the cups, and cause the corner to fold down.",75535,4
75535,I would NOT recommend this to carry bras.,75535,4
75535,"BUT, I love this case for panties and socks!",75535,4
75535,"The top netting has six compartments, which can fit 2 thongs per compartment when rolled.",75535,4
75535,"The bottom part of the container is great for regular boy shorts, granny panties, and lingerie.",75535,4
75535,It's pretty bulky; it is the exact height of the bottom part of a carry on roll suitcase.,75535,4
75535,"Perfect for moving around a lot, or if you don't have a lingerie drawer.",75535,4
75536,They will be a perfect match with the school uniform.,75536,4
75537,"They arrived very big, I even called Frogg Togg for sizing - I will keep them because my grandson will grow into them but they are big.",75537,4
75538,"Nice top, I use it for exercising.",75538,4
75538,Thin material but comfortable.,75538,4
75538,I ordered a bigger size.,75538,4
75538,"I usually a medium, 38c.",75538,4
75542,"Fits a bit loose on my wrist, but otherwise has a nice look to it.",75542,4
75543,Nice but took two months to get it.,75543,4
75544,This braclet was for  My husband.,75544,4
75544,Seems to meet expectations.,75544,4
75544,Would have been better  if the wrist size was larger.,75544,4
75545,"Good visor but not best, it fits very well but it's not an official Air Force product.",75545,4
75545,"It looks very nice, and as you walk by, people will notice the emblem right away, but those that get very close and look closely, will notice the bad stitching.",75545,4
75545,It's uneven and it can be done better.,75545,4
75546,When I first received it I thought it looked too much like a man's wallet.,75546,4
75546,I love all the slots for cards though and it does fit nicely in my pocket.,75546,4
75547,"Just received the US Medium and if it fit well I think this would be a great coat, stylish looking, good cut and seems well put together - probably would give it 4-5 stars.",75547,4
75547,Still pretty puzzled about the sizing though.,75547,4
75547,I looked at the chart and I still can't seem to wrap my head around the measurements that they provide.,75547,4
75547,"I'm about 5'7"" and weigh about 150 lbs with an athletic build.",75547,4
75547,"I normally purchase US small coats (North Face, Kuhl, Eddie Bauer, etc).",75547,4
75547,"Based on other's reviews, the sizing chart and my other coats I figured the US Medium would be the right size.",75547,4
75547,"Unfortunately the shoulders are too snug, chest too tight when the coat is zipped, and even the sleeves are too short.",75547,4
75547,The label on the coat says XL but when I ordered on Amazon the drop down menu said US Medium/Asia XL.,75547,4
75547,I've ordered the US Large/Asia 4XL (since there seems to be no US Medium+ any longer) and will update my review when I receive the larger size.,75547,4
75547,*** UPDATE - so after posting this review I looked at my order from Amazon and confirmed that I ordered the US Medium/Asia XL however on the review page it says US XS/Asia XL.,75547,4
75547,I am really puzzled right now and can't tell if they sent me the wrong size (US XS instead of US Medium)!,75547,4
75547,I hope they can get the kinks out of the ordering and sizing.,75547,4
75547,I may have to cancel the US Large I ordered since I really have no idea what they sent!!!,75547,4
75547,*** UPDATE 2 - after communicating with the seller (who responded very quickly) I received a refund and proper size information.,75547,4
75547,The sizing on the Amazon order drop down menu is accurate now and for my size the US S/Asia 2XL is correct.,75547,4
75547,Unfortunately they did not have the black available on Amazon Prime so I ordered a green and have been very happy with the purchase and sizing.,75547,4
75547,"The shoulders are only very slightly tight, although I do have broad shoulders, but not really noticeable.",75547,4
75547,Well worth the <$40 for a coat that could sell for over twice that from an American branded company.,75547,4
75548,This was a great outfit for family pictures.,75548,4
75548,Really cute jumpsuit that required a tank underneath because it was so low cut.,75548,4
75548,"Kinda short but I'm 5'2"" so it wasn't that big of a deal.",75548,4
75548,Overall I was very pleased with my purchase.,75548,4
75548,"It would be a great ""festival"" outfit too.",75548,4
75549,Okay for the price,75549,4
75550,The hat stays on my kids head and keeps him cool.,75550,4
75550,Don't care for the look.,75550,4
75551,"Order your regular size, but also recommend purchasing and ""installing"" petal pads at the ball of the foot and heel.",75551,4
75551,"Heels gap a bit and have a awkward pitch, but this is easily corrected with the pads.",75551,4
75551,Overall quite comfortable and can be dressed up or down as needed.,75551,4
75553,"A little flimsy, and the grommets are not very strong.",75553,4
75553,But nice for as long as they last,75553,4
75554,"It's nice, but it is smaller than I was expecting.",75554,4
75555,For the price it's not bad but I wish it was tighter quality is good,75555,4
75556,Super cute and very Scottish!,75556,4
75557,"It was unexpectedly lightweight and had a nice ""feel"" to the fabric.",75557,4
75557,Will have to be careful about undergarments since it is tight.,75557,4
75558,only color hubby will wear,75558,4
75559,Love how the chain doesn't hang really low.,75559,4
75560,"Love this pendent, it looks very cute",75560,4
75561,super cute gift for my little niece!,75561,4
75562,It looks like the product on the model (unlike some Chinese dresses online).,75562,4
75563,doesn't look at all like pic but still nice,75563,4
75564,These little boots are SOOOO cute!,75564,4
75564,We get lots of compliments every time she wears.,75564,4
75564,They are easy to get on and they stay on very well.,75564,4
75564,She can pull them off but usually only does if she's in her car seat so I assume that means they're pretty comfortable.,75564,4
75564,:) Haven't worn them outside much so I don't know how well they hold up in the elements.,75564,4
75564,"I do wish they had a little more rubber on the bottom, as they're slippery on our hardwood floors, but overall very pleased with these boots!",75564,4
75565,Looks good and works good.,75565,4
75566,Nice design but sizing is a little on the smaller side.,75566,4
75567,"Good quality and very warm, only thing I wish is it had hand wormer pockets, but all in all a good Jacket",75567,4
75568,"Bit tight and the straps are so short, but I love the racer back style and the amount of push up.",75568,4
75569,Only complaint is that the stone is not as dark as in the picture,75569,4
75570,Even though the coat is to snug I am still happy with the coat.,75570,4
75570,I love that you can remove the hood and also remove the fur.,75570,4
75570,"It has been a very warm, comfy coat.",75570,4
75571,I thought the costume was great and fit my wife pretty well.,75571,4
75571,"She's 5'7"" and curvy so I ordered an XL just to be safe.",75571,4
75571,That was a good choice because a L would have been to short in the torso.,75571,4
75571,"Her main complaint was that it was a little too short in the torso, but all things considered, it was a good costume with a pretty good fit.",75571,4
75571,Just be advised that the sizes run small.,75571,4
75572,Very pretty but was so small I gave it to my 15 year old,75572,4
75573,A little small but good quality.,75573,4
75574,Would of gave it five stars but it's my own fault can see my lovely marks if u know what I mean ladies three the outfit have to get better tummy control panties,75574,4
75576,Caused a little chaffing,75576,4
75577,Pants are nice but somewhat don't fit too well.,75577,4
75578,They fit well everywhere except they are snug at the ankles.,75578,4
75578,I wash them by hand to prevent further shrinkeage.,75578,4
75579,Way too short to be a dress.,75579,4
75579,Fits fine as a long shirt but had to have shorts on under it.,75579,4
75579,Overall I love it but it is not a dress.,75579,4
75580,"I like this shirt a lot, love the longer short sleeves!",75580,4
75581,A little large than expected.,75581,4
75581,Will need to see how quickly the image fades and fabric frays.,75581,4
75582,I ordered a size bigger than what I needed and it still is kinda tight.,75582,4
75582,Other than that I love the shirt!,75582,4
75584,Good cheap booty shorts for gym or lounging.,75584,4
75584,Material is streatchy cotton.,75584,4
75584,You can wear up for tummy control or folded down.,75584,4
75584,Will definitely buy more.,75584,4
75585,I agree with other reviews.,75585,4
75585,"The coat is very cute, but the sleeves are tight.",75585,4
75585,Wearing anything other than a light shirt is impossible.,75585,4
75585,"I did order a size larger, and it fits great across the chest, however.",75585,4
75586,I'm 5'6 and 117lbs.,75586,4
75586,The belt actually came a little smaller than expected but it still fit on the last two holes.,75586,4
75586,It's pretty true to color but my only complaint is that it is pretty stiff so bending it into the loops is a little bit annoying.,75586,4
75586,I bought the belt for work though and I'm pretty sure it's the best belt for the price.,75586,4
75587,"darling, if she would just leave it on",75587,4
75588,I am enjoying my Super Soft Plaid Checker Detachable Hood Flannel.,75588,4
75589,Would have given 5 stars but there is no under boob support.,75589,4
75590,Nice blouse for the price,75590,4
75591,Great as a bathing suit cover but cannot be worn as a dress without leggings.,75591,4
75592,I ordered this on Tuesday & got it Thursday GREAT shipping!,75592,4
75592,"It fits good but it was just a little too short so i should've ordered a medium i wear a 34C, so they may have been the issue, so i put a black crop top underneath because the material is somewhat see through, other than that this was a great product!",75592,4
75594,Very nice for the price,75594,4
75595,The title says 14g but the item is actually 16g read carefully.,75595,4
75596,"Very pretty, though when wearing, the earrings turn backwards.",75596,4
75596,"I'll have to twist the wire before wearing again, so the shells, and not the backing, show.",75596,4
75599,"I am 5'4"", 115lbs and ordered a size 5.",75599,4
75599,They are form-fitting pants - great color!,75599,4
75599,But definitely not quite jeggings.,75599,4
75599,I would call the material more like regular jean material; there is barely any stretch.,75599,4
75599,The material seems to be good quality.,75599,4
75599,They were used for a dance team performance.,75599,4
75600,I would have liked the material to be more appropriate for winter.,75600,4
75601,"I can't figure out how to tie it so it looks nice, but that's just me.",75601,4
75602,I love it but it's a little small - I have an average to small head and it's as big as it will go and is tight.,75602,4
75603,"Writing fades fairly quickly, but otherwise, its adorable.",75603,4
75604,Nice shoes but a little too big.,75604,4
75605,Except yhe necklace too thin.,75605,4
75606,Perfect for my costume!,75606,4
75606,"Great price for something i needed as only a prop, and it works perfectly!",75606,4
75607,"The blouse is very comfortable, lightweight, but not shear.",75607,4
75607,I ordered the blue.,75607,4
75607,The blue pictured appears to be a royal blue.,75607,4
75607,The blouse that I received is a pewter color.,75607,4
75607,The band near the bottom is a lighter shade than the rest of the blouse.,75607,4
75607,"The color is okay, but not a true blue.",75607,4
75608,I bought this a few weeks ago and it is holding up very well.,75608,4
75608,"Looks nice, very much like the picture.",75608,4
75608,True to size as well.,75608,4
75609,This dress is beautiful and fits great.,75609,4
75609,I took one star off because the dress has a bad chemical/plastic smell.,75609,4
75611,Had sat in bag for a long time and the left side was pushed and formed to the inside - hard to see out of the eye hole on that side.,75611,4
75611,Hoping to reform it with a mannequin head.,75611,4
75612,Absolutely love this anklet.,75612,4
75612,"I wasn't expecting much at first because of the price but it was perfect its very cute, and I love the little bell that is on it.",75612,4
75612,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wore it while I was at the gym and when I got home I realized it no longer looked rose gold in color the clip that holds it together turned a very dark brown almost black in color along with one side of the heart and the little circles that are on the double chain.,75612,4
75612,Other than the discoloration I have to say I am very satisfied with what I received and especially at the price that I paid.,75612,4
75613,i like the way they look.,75613,4
75613,very impressed with price and quality.,75613,4
75613,"im 5.11 183 and the medium fits me just fine, even a little room to breath.",75613,4
75614,Clasps were loosed so I would of had to have sewn those had I kept the dress.,75614,4
75614,Actually returned it because 2 of my daughters classmates ordered the same dress,75614,4
75615,Material is a little stiff at first.,75615,4
75615,Also I find a little annoying the two belt closers,75615,4
75616,I got this for my husband and it is a beautiful ring.,75616,4
75616,I wish they had the same ring for women as I prefer it to the one I bought for myself.,75616,4
75617,My daughter loved it and it was great quality for the price.,75617,4
75618,My Grand daughter is using them for Halloween to be a Pegasus.they did have a rubbery smell when we first opened them but it is disapating now.,75618,4
75619,Order your real size,75619,4
75620,Cute but need to order a size larger if you want it to look like the picture,75620,4
75621,Bought for Halloween outfit and I must say they fit great and look HOT!,75621,4
75622,Run little small and some plastic parts have sharp corners I had to file down.,75622,4
75623,"These are great watches, got them for my young nephew for Christmas.",75623,4
75623,He loves them but it came with a scratch across the back of the black one.,75623,4
75623,No big deal seeing as they were for a 7yr old however a little quality control wouldn't hurt.,75623,4
75625,"Nicely made, good weight, goes with a lot.",75625,4
75626,Love this zip up sweatshirt.,75626,4
75627,"These are gorgeous, and the size is really good for my nips.",75627,4
75627,"Only one downside, one of the clickers doesn't snap closed, it can be opened with the slightest tug.",75627,4
75628,The hat was pretty flimsy and I didn't use it.,75628,4
75629,"Beautiful dress, fits great and true to size.",75629,4
75629,The only problem with this dress is it has no side zipper to get in and out of the dress.,75629,4
75629,You have to have someone there to lace you up in this dress.,75629,4
75629,The coloring is a little off I ordered the grey and it has a lavender tint to it.,75629,4
75630,Only thing is the time tends to slow down after a while so I have to adjust it once in a while,75630,4
75631,The shoes fit great.,75631,4
75631,I am happy I read reviews .,75631,4
75631,I ordered a half size up at first placed order than read reviews of how small they come .,75631,4
75631,Yes they run small.,75631,4
75631,Get a full size bigger than regular size .,75631,4
75631,I had already place my order than read review I sent an email to change size they were nice about it changed size right away didn't affect delivery I was very happy,75631,4
75632,I bought the dress for my office party.,75632,4
75632,I usually wear a medium but since it is the holidays and I have packed on a few extra pounds I decided to play it safe and order a large.,75632,4
75632,The fit was perfect.,75632,4
75632,I have a short torso so the cut worked with my frame.,75632,4
75632,The fabric is nothing fancy so this would be great for a casual get together.,75632,4
75632,I wore a petticoat with it and I received several compliments.,75632,4
75632,If you are any bit top heavy be ready for your girls to be exposed.,75632,4
75632,I could not keep them contained and received the side eye from several judgemental ladies.,75632,4
75633,A little bit short but comfortable,75633,4
75634,"Loved the feel of it, it's a great addition to my wardrobe.",75634,4
75635,Great for the price,75635,4
75636,"Buttons are really noisy BUT the jacket fits well, comfy, the pockets are sewn shut BUT I cut them open and nothing is ripping so now there are pockets, it is pretty stretchy so that is good also.",75636,4
75637,"great fit, good quality",75637,4
75638,fast delivery and looks just like the picture.,75638,4
75639,They look adorable on my 7 month old!,75639,4
75641,Runs small but still looks pretty good.,75641,4
75642,"Cute shirt, fits well, but is a tad short; keeping it though!",75642,4
75643,The large fit very well and didn't pull anywhere.,75643,4
75643,"(I am 5'7"", wear sz 6/8 bottom, 34 C top.)",75643,4
75643,The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because it is very short.,75643,4
75643,So short that I cannot wear the black nylons for a more authentic look.,75643,4
75643,I'll wear leggings for this one.,75643,4
75643,The material is much nicer than I expected and the pleat/flap in the front and back is very flattering.,75643,4
75644,we used these to make our own diy corsages for my daughters wedding and they worked great!,75644,4
75645,Fits and washes well.,75645,4
75646,"A bit bunchy in the top, but it works!",75646,4
75647,Very Beautiful but larger than I realized.,75647,4
75648,I like the swim dress it fix nice.,75648,4
75649,I like it but I find the lettering to be very faint.,75649,4
75649,And I think I was expecting it to be a little larger.,75649,4
75649,It came with two chains which was a nice suprise.,75649,4
75650,"I love the cut, flowy yet still reveals my figure which is what I wanted.",75650,4
75650,It hangs a little lower than I expected and the straps are a little too long for me but can be fixed with a quick sew job.,75650,4
75650,It is comfy and kind of thin.,75650,4
75650,(not paper thin by anymeans) I wish it were a little thicker (in regards to material) the print on it was a tad faded but overall I'm pretty pleased.,75650,4
75651,Very cute love it!,75651,4
75651,My heads too big tho:)  always slips off,75651,4
75652,"I like the feeling of the material, the leggings are medium coverage but are semitransparent, so black undies or a big shirt, dress, or sweater are preferable.",75652,4
75654,"Great jacket, wish there was a patch on the back though.",75654,4
75654,"Also, the XL is a little big for those wondering.",75654,4
75655,Son loved zipped picket for iPhone.,75655,4
75656,"Nice cheap Chinese hat,I like it!",75656,4
75657,"I can wear them with almost anything, sundresses, jeans....",75657,4
75657,The only item to note is that the part between the toe is stiff and therefore I gave it one star less.,75657,4
75657,I still enjoy wearing them!,75657,4
75658,Could be a little bigger but fits nicely.,75658,4
75659,One is yellow and one is white but that is not a deal breaker.,75659,4
75659,Both sparkle nicely in the sun.,75659,4
75659,Birthday daughter will love them.,75659,4
75659,They are not large but they have the elegance only diamonds can give.,75659,4
75660,very nice slub t style,75660,4
75661,"fits smoothly against the skin, washes well, great product",75661,4
75663,"Nice case, some of pills in the case weren't colored :/",75663,4
75664,My daughter is turning six soon and I ordered size 7 tall.,75664,4
75664,It fits her great.,75664,4
75664,"The shirt is looser than a lot of pajamas, which I like.",75664,4
75664,The pants have a cuff which keeps them from dragging on the ground.,75664,4
75664,"My daughter is not slim, so sometimes it's hard to find clothes that aren't too tight on her belly but fit the length okay.",75664,4
75664,This worked out great.,75664,4
75664,I wish they were a little softer.,75664,4
75665,"In one of my ""let's look this up for other pregnant stories"" moments, I read a random forum thread from one woman on how she was wearing her bellaband.",75665,4
75665,"I have tried mine four times now - I have two pair of formerly-every-day jeans that are fitted and not stretchy, so during my second pregancy they became quite tight and uncomfortable by the end of the day during first trimester bloating.",75665,4
75665,"When I first tried the bellaband with my fitted jeans as shown folded over, when I sit or bend over, the band rides up off the jeans in the back (and I am a size 4 with a cyclist's butt - there's not much going on back there).",75665,4
75665,"Today I tried this suggestion - put it on with the grippy layer UNDER the jeans, not over, at hip level, then zip up and fold down over hips.",75665,4
75665,I was doing this before but completely on top of the jeans.,75665,4
75665,What a difference it makes!,75665,4
75665,I do not have to keep adjusting it.,75665,4
75665,I am totally comfortable!,75665,4
75665,"You can see in the picture it has ridden up in the back some, but I don't feel it and it's still in place in the front.",75665,4
75665,"I will keep wearing it this way until my belly is big enough to wear it unfolded, or the jeans stop fitting in other areas.",75665,4
75665,I hope this comment helps!,75665,4
75666,Not sure this really makes any difference.,75666,4
75666,It's very well made and very simple.,75666,4
75667,Lovely dress..fits as decribe..worth the price.,75667,4
75668,The fit was a bit tight but overall good!,75668,4
75669,I read the other reviews and still chose the product.,75669,4
75669,It wasn't perfect for my purposes but is a nice product.,75669,4
75669,I too took the little tag off.,75669,4
75669,It's a good solid piece.,75669,4
75670,It's a bit rough and small.,75670,4
75670,So just make sure your order it a size bigger than you think you'll need if you want it to be a little baggy,75670,4
75673,These were to small on me but I expected that to happen.,75673,4
75673,I have extremely long legs so I had a backup plan.,75673,4
75673,"But other than that these are great, they come looking exactly like the picture.",75673,4
75673,If you have long thicker legs I recommend finding another product but if your small or medium length go for it,75673,4
75675,I'm a size 20 and I ordered the 6x!!,75675,4
75677,"I was looking for a pair of oversized wayfarer styled glasses, and this pair fit the description perfectly.",75677,4
75677,"The shipping was extremely fast and like I said, I'm thrilled with the product.",75677,4
75677,I didn't receive the random Shades Daddy promo though.,75677,4
75677,"I was under the impression that I'd get the oakleys, lens cleaner and promo sunglasses.",75677,4
75677,I only got the oakleys.,75677,4
75677,It's not important but it's still false advertisement.,75677,4
75678,color started fading so if you do order add nail polish clear on it and it will last longer,75678,4
75679,You get what you pay for people.,75679,4
75680,It's somewhat see through.,75680,4
75680,It is cute though.,75680,4
75681,"I do like the ring, and the pink color is not too pale at all, just not as bold as the picture shows.",75681,4
75681,"However, I bought this to wear on my pinky which is a size 4, but this is much closer to a size 5 so it is of no use to me.",75681,4
75682,I love this bracelet but the stones were not as vibrant as in the picture.,75682,4
75682,They are more raw versus polished.,75682,4
75682,Still worth it as my primary purpose was for the healing properties of the stones.,75682,4
75683,Overall decent swimsuit just top is not very supportive.,75683,4
75683,"For the price, it is great.",75683,4
75684,"I love the fit of this product, it very much mimics a bra.",75684,4
75684,"There is no padding whatsoever in the cups so that can feel non supportive here, but the underwire is nice to hold you up.",75684,4
75684,The swimsuit very much fits just like the bra size and it's great that the back fits comfortably.,75684,4
75685,The bracelet is very nice!,75685,4
75685,I just wish it would of came in a gift box because this is a XMAS gift for my hair stylist.,75685,4
75686,The bead work is done well.,75686,4
75686,"My only disappointment is I ordered IVORY and the dress is labeled ivory, however the dress is pure white.",75686,4
75687,Wish it was a little longer....but still cute.,75687,4
75688,Bought this as a gift for my daughter.,75688,4
75688,She seems to like it.,75688,4
75688,She only had a couple concerns.,75688,4
75688,The plastic liner that holds the phone is lightweight.,75688,4
75688,Also she said she wishes it would hold a little more in the card slots.,75688,4
75689,It was quite comfortable... the sleeves were a bit short for my long arms.. but rolled up they were fine.... it does wrinkle as it comes out of the dryer... and needs ironing.. but a beautiful color,75689,4
75690,This dress is adorable.,75690,4
75690,Looks great on and is well made.,75690,4
75690,It is a tiny bit short if you have long legs and are a taller but not so short it is a shirt.,75690,4
75691,Love these socks a little tight but overall great,75691,4
75692,"This top is somewhat of an awkward fit, and the material is weird, but it is comfy and I would recommend it.",75692,4
75692,"I wear a US 3X and bought a 5X, and it fits loose, but definitely comfy.",75692,4
75693,"They fit well and stuff, they were received quickly... it's just that they look a little bushy when they are on...",75693,4
75693,They're super soft though.,75693,4
75693,It may just be my body type.,75693,4
75694,top has no support but for the price it's good,75694,4
75695,With some modifications this is perfect.,75695,4
75695,"I love how sturdy the walls are, not going to get squished in your bag.",75695,4
75695,I love the fabric on the bottom BUT it is like 3 inches wide which makes this easily fall over.,75695,4
75695,"I cut the bottom out and sowed (is that a word) in my own bottom liner that I got from a craft store, it's just a 1/4 inch thick foam thing.",75695,4
75695,Really random stitching since I am no expert.,75695,4
75695,BUT it works now and fits.,75695,4
75695,It is kinda small for being called Jumbo but I like putting my wallet and planner on the outside of the organizer yet still in my bag.,75695,4
75696,"Pretty good buy...I'm small, under 100 pounds and short, so I appreciated that this sweatshirt was slim fitting and the sleeves weren't too long.",75696,4
75696,"It's medium weight, I would have preferred heavier weight as I live in Chicago where it gets so cold, but if I layer I think I'll be ok.",75696,4
75696,"The bottom hits me in the middle of my butt, I think it would look better if it were either shorter or longer, but it's still a decent fit.",75696,4
75698,Good for the price,75698,4
75699,I have some older Carhartts and ordered the same size as those pants and these ran a little bit smaller.,75699,4
75699,I can still wear them but they are more snug.,75699,4
75700,It's a little snug around the top and the zipper is a tad tricky but it looks good.,75700,4
75700,I'm a US medium and a size 9/10 in jeans.,75700,4
75700,The fabric is surprisingly thick and the skirt is exactly like the picture.,75700,4
75700,I'm so excited to wear it for my occasion.,75700,4
75700,It even came early in ecstatic.,75700,4
75701,The turquoise stone looks less like turquoise and more like blue plastic than what is pictured.,75701,4
75703,not sure what to do with the extra cord - but otherwise comfortable and really nice looking.,75703,4
75704,My daughter doesn't just pee right through them.,75704,4
75704,And they fit her perfect!!,75704,4
75704,The only thing  I didn't like was I couldn't pick out the paterns I wanted.,75704,4
75704,I got 4 lions and 1 that I'm guessing is maybe a goat(??),75704,4
75704,I wanted the cute girly ones since I have a girl and it did take a little but to get them.,75704,4
75704,But I do love they way.,75704,4
75704,They fit and the way they absorb  so I won't complain to much on the design that I got.,75704,4
75704,She stilL looks cute in them.,75704,4
75705,The Fit is a bit small for the brand.,75705,4
75705,The band isn't as forgiving as others by Saxx,75705,4
75706,Have ordered a couple times.,75706,4
75706,"Have had others that rusted, which is never a good thing with a white shirt.",75706,4
75706,This one hasn't yet.,75706,4
75707,To small have to order next size,75707,4
75708,I like the sweatshirt but the arms are way too long.,75708,4
75708,The picture is beautiful.,75708,4
75708,I wish it came in a Women's Petite XL.,75708,4
75708,Maybe the arms would be a little shorter.,75708,4
75709,These were easy to install and fit perfectly.,75709,4
75709,There is a noticeable difference in thickness of the Oakley original lense and these.,75709,4
75709,Oakleys seem a bit thicker--arguably better quality.,75709,4
75709,The polarization is evident and seems good.,75709,4
75709,"Although I do wish ""polarized"" was marked in the lenses like the original lenses (hence the -1 star).",75709,4
75709,"The black lenses give a bluish tint when looking through them (some lenses brands/types filter yellow, or grey).",75709,4
75709,These are a bit darker than the stock lenses but that's fine with me.,75709,4
75709,"Overall, I am pleased.",75709,4
75709,Only time will tell how these will stand up to the elements.,75709,4
75709,I will update if I have any issues,75709,4
75710,"Good fit, good quality.",75710,4
75710,But the 100% cotton wrinkles easily.,75710,4
75711,Very cute and warm!,75711,4
75711,Main problem is the hole for the thumb is very hard to get in.,75711,4
75711,Add in that a 1 year old doesn't know how to move her thumbs correctly.,75711,4
75711,She ended up just having a whole fist in the main compartment.,75711,4
75711,"Maybe when she gets a little older, she will still fit them and she will figure it out.",75711,4
75712,Like everything about it except a little too short.,75712,4
75712,Like the material and the fit but wish it was longer,75712,4
75713,Not as comfortable as I would have hoped.,75713,4
75714,Nice shoes fit good and they are comfortable,75714,4
75715,Love it i wish it fit my boobs better bc they're huge and im skinny so i don't really like how my boobs fit but overall its my favorite crop top .,75715,4
75716,Pretty good just light and short sleeves,75716,4
75717,"It's really baeutiful, I'm glad I ordered it more large, and even so it's a bit tight on my back!",75717,4
75717,Add two sizes more if you want to buy.,75717,4
75719,I like these a lot - needed to go over a bandaged leg and works really well,75719,4
75720,I wore it to my daughters wedding.,75720,4
75720,Perfect for the civil ceremony she had.,75720,4
75721,The mirror effect has a strange look to it as time passes.,75721,4
75721,I guess it's wear and tear.,75721,4
75721,"Where the screws are located, the mirror shows where the glasses were pulled and held onto the frames.",75721,4
75721,"Other than that, great temporary sunglasses.",75721,4
75722,Its made very well and fits perfectly.,75722,4
75722,The COLOR is NOTHING like this picture though.,75722,4
75722,It's the color of Pepto Bismol.,75722,4
75723,These are great but a little small...,75723,4
75723,I wish they were a little bit stretchier around the thighs and butt.,75723,4
75723,"However, they're thick material and very comfy!",75723,4
75724,ordered the wrong size.,75724,4
75724,tie didn't come in the pink and black stripe i wanted,75724,4
75725,"It could be a little more fitted, but I still can wear it, not a bad fit because it is well taliored so it can pass.",75725,4
75726,Nott he the best quality but not bad for the price.,75726,4
75726,Just know it run's small and order accordingly.,75726,4
75727,This fit like a shirt on me but was still oh so sexy!,75727,4
75727,My husband loved it.,75727,4
75727,I normally wear a med/large.,75727,4
75727,If you're curvy and/or have a large bottom.,75727,4
75727,This may not be for you,75727,4
75729,"I ordered this because it was cheap, prime eligible, and had good reviews.",75729,4
75729,It's really cute considering the price.,75729,4
75729,The g string that comes with it is way too small there's no way for me to wear it but that's not really why I bought it.,75729,4
75729,The robe is *slightly* snug on the arm holes but it's still comfortable to wear.,75729,4
75729,Definitely buy it if you want it!,75729,4
75729,You won't regret it.,75729,4
75730,"My mother was very happy with this for mother's day, I will buy her more like this",75730,4
75731,A nice fit  and stylish.,75731,4
75732,Very comfy and soft with a bit of eighties flair lol,75732,4
75733,Its your basic black leotard.,75733,4
75733,Only used it for halloween but it worked well and looked flattering.,75733,4
75734,Little off on the measurements but a little altering fixed the problem.,75734,4
75735,"Its a nice caridigan, really sheer materiel, colors are like seen in the picture.",75735,4
75735,The only thing is it is quite tight around the arms (I have bigger arms that normal) so i do suggest to watch out for that while choosing your size.,75735,4
75735,Also after a while the hem of the arm might come a little undone (I just burned the strings).,75735,4
75736,"I ordered a Medium, keep in mind that i'm 5'4 at 130 lbs, the top cup size is perfect, however the back strap doesn't stay tight or in place and i found myself exposed in front of my family for my niece's 3rd birthday at the beach.",75736,4
75736,The bottoms are huge and i have a fairly large butt so i was entertainingly surprised to find my medium bottom is too big.,75736,4
75736,However i was pleased to find that it covered my butt entirely.,75736,4
75736,"Overall, i still looked good in the bathing suit and its really cute!",75736,4
75738,Only gave 4 stars because it's not linen,75738,4
75741,"Great Design and quality, small flaw.",75741,4
75741,"The glasses are of excellent quality, light, and seem durable.",75741,4
75741,This is my second pair of prescription club masters.,75741,4
75741,"I received the made in china model, same quality as the last pair which was made in Italy.",75741,4
75741,"However, the nose pads on my glasses are sharp, when adjusting your glasses with your hand the nose pads tend to scratch you, one star minus.",75741,4
75741,"However this can be easily fixed by a nose pad replacement, nonetheless i consider new glasses should have parts be replaced.",75741,4
75742,Love the lenses but the frames are very fragile but you get what you pay for here.,75742,4
75742,great price for comfortable glasses,75742,4
75744,"It fit as expected, but the elastic in the waistband was the reason I say ""somewhat small.""",75744,4
75744,The elastic is uncomfortably tight on my waist and the rest of the costume fits great.,75744,4
75745,this purse is very spacious and fits everything which is a nice feature.,75745,4
75745,"The small handles seem to be very flimsy and have somehow separated at the base of the purse, and some of the stitching is loose.",75745,4
75745,I have gotten a lot of compliments on this bag but it seems that its not the best quality if using this as an every day carry all.,75745,4
75746,I find AmeriMark's clothes size is not consistent.,75746,4
75746,The dress was a bit big but the jacket was a good fit.,75746,4
75746,I like the price.,75746,4
75748,"I absolutely love the shirt, but ""runs small"" is an understatement.",75748,4
75748,I'm usually between a small and a medium.,75748,4
75748,"I ordered a medium and could barely get it on, so I returned it and got an XL.",75748,4
75748,"Even that size is a bit more snug than I'd like, so hopefully it doesn't shrink in the wash!",75748,4
75749,Very comfy to stand all day (which I usually do).,75749,4
75749,"I wear Cole Haan dress shoes and I can't stand on them all day, I can with this pair -- the desired effect!",75749,4
75749,"They're not very dressy, but can fulfill a business-casual dress code in my opinion.",75749,4
75749,"As a note to the future buyer, the first day as with many leather shoes is terrible.",75749,4
75749,"They hurt until they break in, but once they do (for me it was 3 full days of wearing) they feel great!",75749,4
75750,Nice.. for the price.,75750,4
75752,Love this dress very cute,75752,4
75753,It's not too short and I'm 5'9 so it works for me perfectly.,75753,4
75753,I didn't like the silver hand pieces & the legging boot covers but everything else about it is good,75753,4
75754,Super sexy and sturdy!,75754,4
75755,"This product works very well BUT, more than one applicator is really important to have on hand.",75755,4
75755,"The company only supplies one and if you run into any kind of problem; falls off the work surface and gets dirt on it, you're stuck!",75755,4
75756,"Gave as Christmas gift, for my nephew.",75756,4
75756,Fits and looks great!,75756,4
75757,Good price for a dozen pairs of casual stud earrings.,75757,4
75757,"They have silicone backs, very small but acceptable.",75757,4
75759,Not as attractive as pictured.,75759,4
75759,I would go a least a half size or an entire size down since it's very thin.,75759,4
75759,I normally wear a comfort fit 11 but had to size down to a 10.,75759,4
75759,Good customer service from seller and very attentive.,75759,4
75760,It fit good and arecomfortable,75760,4
75761,Was bigger than expected,75761,4
75763,A little bit too big for a toe  ring but excellent for the fingers.,75763,4
75764,They are somewhat smaller than expected but not so small I cannot wear them.,75764,4
75764,They stay in place well and comfortable enough I could wear them all day.,75764,4
75766,"I like the material, but both times that I ordered the shirt, moving up in just one size, the shirt was still too small.",75766,4
75766,"So I gave it to my sister, otherwise, I'd wear it.",75766,4
75766,Too lazy to order another one after two failed attempt on size.,75766,4
75767,Beautiful bracelet at a great price.,75767,4
75767,Wish it were could go a bit smaller as it slides around my wrist too much.,75767,4
75768,"Did not fit in any way, shape, or form.",75768,4
75768,Definitely NOT plus sized.,75768,4
75768,"Probably a good product for a normal woman, but not for a large woman.",75768,4
75770,It would be the perfect backpack if it were a little bigger,75770,4
75771,"Its cute, but it is somewhat sheer.",75771,4
75771,It was covered in lint and hair in places.,75771,4
75771,Had to throw in the wash. Also be prepared to iron it.,75771,4
75772,"as advertised, quick delivery",75772,4
75773,"Good product, nice weight of cloth?",75773,4
75774,just normal and i bought those as couple shoes with my girl friend.,75774,4
75774,"So, Imm really content with it",75774,4
75775,"the stone is a little bit darker than I expected, but I am quite fond of the ring.",75775,4
75776,Looks and feels good,75776,4
75777,perfect size for my 6 year old son,75777,4
75778,Nice gloves and a good price.,75778,4
75779,I like the unique shape as well.,75779,4
75779,And the arms reach past the lenses when folded!,75779,4
75780,The sweater length is perfect.,75780,4
75782,The first one we received was too small but they replaced it without us having to send the other sweater back because of the cost.,75782,4
75782,Great customer service and love the sweater.,75782,4
75783,Nice with leggings on a cold day....runs bit big and somewhat baggy....but looked ok!,75783,4
75784,"I'm short so they were kind of higher than I expected, but I made it work",75784,4
75785,"Thin material, but comfortable.",75785,4
75786,It's very pretty I ordered 2 sizes  bigger then I would normally wear fits a bit snug but pretty happy with it the shorts are a bit short but over all pretty pleased with it,75786,4
75787,Best ones I've found so far in the value category.,75787,4
75787,"XL fits well (I'm a 35"" waist) Pouch could be a tiny bit bigger but does the job to lift and keep the boys from sticking to the thighs.",75787,4
75787,Modal stretches nicely and feels cool and comfortable.,75787,4
75788,Pros: Great looking and feeling belt.,75788,4
75788,"Nice and thick

Cons: Only issues is that the leather around the fabric is so thick that it makes it tough to take the belt off.",75788,4
75788,The leather portion ends up getting stuck on the belt loops.,75788,4
75788,Follow up: After a few weeks of use i have noticed that it has broken in and catches on the belt loops less.,75788,4
75790,Nice fabric very pretty.,75790,4
75791,I ordered this for my 15 year old daughter.,75791,4
75791,It looks nice on her.,75791,4
75791,"And, has laundered well.",75791,4
75792,I like this top.,75792,4
75793,I like the quality of this jacket.,75793,4
75793,Its a good buy for the price.,75793,4
75794,It's see thru in the rear.,75794,4
75794,"Other than that, it's a great fit.",75794,4
75795,Ordered this dress for my nautical themed baby shower.,75795,4
75795,Material is a little thin but it was hot and I was thankful for it!,75795,4
75795,Looks elegant but not overly dressy.,75795,4
75795,It is long but I am also super short and just throwing on some wedges made it wearable.,75795,4
75795,And most importantly super comfortable as well!,75795,4
75796,Nice fit but kind of still too tight i even order Xlarge ugh but anyway shipping was fast,75796,4
75797,Very nice scarf !,75797,4
75798,The product is easy to install and has lasted for several months.,75798,4
75798,I would certainly buy this tape again should I need this type of product again.,75798,4
75799,I just wish Amazon had it in more colors.,75799,4
75799,Seems to be sold out in every color/size.,75799,4
75799,"Unlike similar shirts on Amazon, this one runs true to size.",75799,4
75799,No need to size up.,75799,4
75799,love the way it drapes and love the arm coverage.,75799,4
75800,"Not as loose and flowy as picture shoes.. i am 5.3 and purchased a small, if i wear low on hips its at desired length but it's like a straight or boot cut.",75800,4
75800,Doesn't open up at bottom or throughout leg .,75800,4
75800,Still like the style and design.,75800,4
75801,Great watch for a steal.,75801,4
75801,"Works like it should without any issues, clear and efficient.",75801,4
75801,"If you're looking for a budget watch, this is a good option.",75801,4
75802,"this are pretty, but very sharp, handle with care",75802,4
75804,I shoul've ordered a size smaller.,75804,4
75804,Very pretty and comfortable.,75804,4
75805,Could be a little bigger.,75805,4
75806,Bought with Amazon prime which also advertised free returns but cost $6.00 for ups to pick up.,75806,4
75806,"Had to return
because the shoes seem to run small compared to my other boat shoes.",75806,4
75807,"This one fit wonderful
Beautiful dress
Very fast service
Thank you Amazon",75807,4
75808,"But I love this jacket, it will be fitting as expected so",75808,4
75809,I somehow lost my favorite bow belt and bought this one as a replacement.,75809,4
75809,The bow is slightly larger than I was expecting but still completely doable.,75809,4
75809,Depending on what size you get this is definitely meant to be a waist/ under-bust belt not a normal belt for pants (unless you buy a size up).,75809,4
75809,I wish I loved this belt the same or more than the one I lost but it is still very cute.,75809,4
75809,"There are two buttons behind the belt to hold it together, I've never had a problem with them coming undone.",75809,4
75809,"For the low price and pretty decent quality there's not much to complain about, however the bow looks like it was hot glued onto the belt.",75809,4
75809,It is not noticeable when you're wearing it but it makes me nervous that in the future it will come off.,75809,4
75810,The only thing that sucks about this bathing suit is that the top gets tangled.,75810,4
75810,I ended up using my own set of bottoms because the ones that come with this were too small and showed my ass.,75810,4
75811,Ankle socks are fine.,75811,4
75811,"Crew socks though are not elastic enough in the ankle, leg space in our case.",75811,4
75811,They are almost impossible for my 7 year old to put on without help.,75811,4
75811,"They aren't too tight, just on the normal / snug side, but they are really hard to stretch to get over the foot.",75811,4
75812,Worked well for me and our sensuous activities.,75812,4
75813,"Cute earrings, can be dressy or sport.",75813,4
75814,My grandson (12 years old) loves his belt & wears it all of the time.,75814,4
75814,My only problem was that it didn't give a size range so he won't be wearing it long as it just fits him now...no growing room.,75814,4
75815,Not sweater fabric but washes easy!,75815,4
75817,"Fits good, looks good",75817,4
75818,Material is stiffer than I thought it'd be.,75818,4
75818,These are more for wearing out and about.,75818,4
75819,I was very excited to get this shirt and when received was extremely soft.,75819,4
75819,"However, the XL size is a small for an XL and I knew I would not be able to get more than a couple of wears from this one.",75819,4
75819,Returned it and will be picking up a 2XL of the same shirt.,75819,4
75820,The fit definitely did not look like the picture.,75820,4
75820,"It was almost like a shift dress, so when I tried it on, there was a lot of give in the waist area.",75820,4
75820,Perhaps a belt may help.,75820,4
75821,Carries all my items very well.,75821,4
75822,I bought them with the intention that they were stretchy for doing yoga or at least teaching my toddler tumbling class.,75822,4
75822,so now they are just a lay around the house legging.,75822,4
75822,Too tight in the butt area to even chance them ripping when going to sit down.,75822,4
75825,"I usually wear XL and got an XL and it fits close to body, not loose.",75825,4
75825,Feels great and is comfy.,75825,4
75825,Has a weird smell so I am air drying it for a while.,75825,4
75825,It looks great and I plan to wear it soon.,75825,4
75826,I got a size that was way too big but it's my fault for picking the big size,75826,4
75827,These have a Very Sensual Feel to them.,75827,4
75827,They are comfortable as well as Sexy.,75827,4
75827,The material is soft and smooth.,75827,4
75827,I find it easier to put on when either slightly aroused or fully aroused.,75827,4
75827,"If you put them on soft you end up having to pull the fabric over your shaft while shoving yourself in, then repeat the process until you're comfortable.",75827,4
75827,They can be worn either hard or soft.,75827,4
75827,They feel like you aren't wearing anything.,75827,4
75827,They are comfortable enough for you to wear them all day.,75827,4
75827,If you wear them under breathable jeans or shorts you can feel the air blow past you.,75827,4
75827,"The Wife likes to stroke which feels nice, but without full sensation, similar to wearing a condom.",75827,4
75827,I gave it 4 Stars because the pouch for your balls is a little snug.,75827,4
75827,If it were better positioned or slightly bigger then I would have given it a full 5 stars.,75827,4
75827,I wish we could rate by the half star as it would have been 4.5 then.,75827,4
75827,"I hope this review has helped someone, if so please mark it as helpful.",75827,4
75829,Great size for large sketchbooks.,75829,4
75829,"The small front pocket is a great design for smaller items
Though there's those two small handles up top where the bag opens, I don't use those but those aren't very bothersome.",75829,4
75829,Just tuck them in the bag of you need.,75829,4
75829,"Overall, this backpack is awesome.",75829,4
75829,Great material and cool design,75829,4
75830,"Go with your size, this top is not suppose to be tight.",75830,4
75830,"I ordered down a size, based on a previous review and wish I hadn't.",75830,4
75830,It's not loose enough  for my taste in this style of top.,75830,4
75830,I guess mine will be gifted.,75830,4
75830,"Nice top for the price, colors are beautiful.",75830,4
75831,"I would be perfect, if I was perfect.",75831,4
75832,Only giving it a four star because of how long it took to ship.,75832,4
75832,It fits perfectly and I couldn't be happier with how they feel on me.,75832,4
75832,I usually wear I size 9-10 in jeans.,75832,4
75832,"And I got a large, and they fit perfectly.",75832,4
75833,"I ordered a size large, and it fit's well, is just slightly larger in width than I expected.",75833,4
75833,"From the pic, it seems to have more of a ""fit and flare"" fit, but it's actually around the same width from the bust down.",75833,4
75833,I still like it and do plan to purchase another in a different color.,75833,4
75833,"The material is nice, color is true to the pic, and the quality is good.",75833,4
75834,"Fits B Cup/ 34 Max
Its still cute",75834,4
75835,"I thought this suit was going to be cheap and total waste, but I actually love it!",75835,4
75835,"I had to order 2 sizes up  (usually a M, had to get an xl) but it fits great and isn't shear or flimsy!",75835,4
75836,"It's heavy, but this is not the sort of ring I'd wear every day, so it's not an issue.",75836,4
75836,"It doesn't look fully authentic, but it's close enough for the general public.",75836,4
75836,"At this price, I wouldn't expect any more.",75836,4
75837,Goes great with palazzo pants.,75837,4
75837,4 stars because of the stitching!,75837,4
75838,I purchased these with the intent to test them out at the next water park or vacation getaway in hopes of a) reducing the chances of burning my feet on scorching hot poolside surfaces and walkways and/or b) reducing the chances of slipping on a wet surface.,75838,4
75838,I paid $20 for two pairs so to me it's worth the cost of trial and error.,75838,4
75839,It's not as long.,75839,4
75839,It come to the top of waist.,75839,4
75839,Other than that it's fine,75839,4
75840,Fit large but terrific panty post C section,75840,4
75842,Very pretty lightweight hat.,75842,4
75843,"The hat is nice, but the strap broke the first time I wore it so now it always flys off with the slightest bit of wind.",75843,4
75843,UPDATE: Received fund from seller.,75843,4
75844,"I ordered the set of 4, which specifies blue, pink, white and red.",75844,4
75844,"I received blue, pink, white, and camo.",75844,4
75844,"I wanted red, not camo.",75844,4
75844,"Still, they look real.",75844,4
75845,"I really like this brand, but these do not fit the same as a pair I purchased some time ago.",75845,4
75845,These fit pretty tightly.,75845,4
75845,I will order again in the next size up.,75845,4
75846,This product does really work!,75846,4
75846,I am just in that point in my pregnancy where my belly has grown enough where I can't comfortably button my pants and sit down.,75846,4
75846,I bought this product going to get lots of extra life out of my pre-pregnancy pants and it does work.,75846,4
75846,Right now I wear it in the folded position.,75846,4
75846,"Holds the pants up nicely while walking around shopping, etc.",75846,4
75846,"Sometimes after getting up from a sitting position I have to hike up my pants slightly, but it's not a big deal because I've always had to do that.",75846,4
75847,They were beautiful but one of the links came apart the first time my wife wore them.,75847,4
75847,Definitely worth the price but not durable enough for much more than casual walking.,75847,4
75848,"I'm 4'11"", about 125 lbs, and the small fits perfectly.",75848,4
75849,Zipper split even though it fit right.,75849,4
75849,"Cheap zipper, had to sw",75849,4
75850,I love this tote for the most part.,75850,4
75850,I originally purchased the crossbody bag in the same pattern but it wasn't quite big enough.,75850,4
75850,"Even going by the measurements, this bag seems to be a bit big.",75850,4
75850,"However, the fabric is nice and the pattern is beautiful.",75850,4
75850,My main complaint is that the gold id already flaking off of the straps.,75850,4
75850,It's pretty bad; it looks like I have shiny dandruff on my shoulders.,75850,4
75850,It's a very roomy bag and holds lots of things.,75850,4
75851,"really like the design, but seem very big",75851,4
75852,very pretty but needs different back with the support to hold them up and secure on the ear.,75852,4
75853,I love this so much!,75853,4
75853,It is super light and cute and goes with a lot of my outfits!,75853,4
75854,I was in need of a wallet and this was good enough.,75854,4
75854,It has more than enough space to hold cash.,75854,4
75854,"However, I wouldn't say the same for the coin pouch, which looks fragile.",75854,4
75854,"If you are planning on storing a lot of coins, I would recommend getting a separate coin purse.",75854,4
75854,"It isn't the most well made wallet out there, but it does the job.",75854,4
75854,"There were a few frays here and there and the design is a bit iffy in places, but overall it looks good.",75854,4
75854,"And as cheap as it is, that is to be expected.",75854,4
75855,These shoes run a little small and a little narrow.,75855,4
75855,I'd go with one size larger for wider feet.,75855,4
75857,They're cute but def run small.,75857,4
75857,Don't think anyone over a size 10 could even wear the extra large.,75857,4
75858,"Fits big, light fabric good material.",75858,4
75859,I ordered this necklace to wear for a wedding.,75859,4
75859,I was hoping it was as pretty as the pictures.,75859,4
75859,It turns out it was!,75859,4
75859,It's well made and the colors are vibrant.,75859,4
75859,Will be wearing it often!,75859,4
75860,"A little bit long to use it as bracelet, nevertheless, I liked it.",75860,4
75861,This is a beautiful shoe....,75861,4
75862,"Nice material,good size bill,stretch fit but even the extra small size is a little big as I have a 6 5/8"" hat size.",75862,4
75863,Can't wait to take my grandsons newborn pictures in this adorable prop,75863,4
75864,I ordered 1x thinking it would be a little large.,75864,4
75864,I'm glad I went with the larger size.,75864,4
75865,Very nice fit and comfortability for work pants.,75865,4
75866,Part of the white gauge got suck in my ear and staid there for a long time.,75866,4
75866,The back that screws on to the gauge got messed up and wouldn't come off.,75866,4
75866,Took a pair of pliers and vice grips to finally break it off.,75866,4
75866,Other than that the tapers are great!,75866,4
75866,But I have learned my lesson in putting screw on gauges in my ear.,75866,4
75867,I used hair elastics to make the finger loops in loops that would fit around my wrist.,75867,4
75869,I will be returning  .,75869,4
75869,I wear a size small iordered a medium.,75869,4
75869,I  will order the large this time.,75869,4
75869,"I am 5'3 1/2  120 the small b
The swim suit is worth the hassle.",75869,4
75869,"Looks great, just need the right size",75869,4
75870,"I really wanted it in blue, but the green worked out well.",75870,4
75870,I son loved the big 'broom-broom' on the shirt and wouldn't take it off.,75870,4
75871,This ring is great looking!,75871,4
75871,It definitely has that 'white gold' look and I really like the high polish.,75871,4
75871,"The ring feels comfortable with its rounded edges, facilitating an easy-on/easy-off fit and all-day wearability.",75871,4
75871,I have slight reservations about the ring's weight.,75871,4
75871,"It's definitely got some good heft to it, and feels a bit bulky.",75871,4
75871,A lot of people will appreciate this attribute because the ring feels significant.,75871,4
75871,I'm not so sure.,75871,4
75871,"Perhaps to get the durability of tungsten, you have to accept its bulk... (You decide.)",75871,4
75872,They are not as thick as regular socks so you should only wear them as needed.,75872,4
75872,They are not thin like stockings though.,75872,4
75872,"The distance from the heel to the top is 19"".",75872,4
75872,"I am 5'8""  and they cover mid knee",75872,4
75873,I use it for Water aerobics so I wanted something that fit tight in the water.,75873,4
75873,I like the look also.,75873,4
75874,"A little flimsy feeling, easy to bend.",75874,4
75874,But looks exactly as pictures.,75874,4
75875,great for wearing over bikini until ready to bare,75875,4
75876,Comfort arable rushed at the waist for a gleteri f feel at be Color is very compliamdntary,75876,4
75877,This bag was a little too narrow for my liking.,75877,4
75877,It has tons of little pockets which is great but once you fill the small pockets it's hard to fit anything in the middle.,75877,4
75877,"I could only put a few diapers, a pack of wipes and some food/formula in the middle.",75877,4
75877,It's good quality and cute pattern but I wouldn't spend the money on it again.,75877,4
75877,Arrived timely as well.,75877,4
75879,Pretty and shows just like the picture.,75879,4
75879,A bit metal-ly looking at it up close.,75879,4
75879,"Better than I expected, as it was under 10 dollars!",75879,4
75880,My girlfriend liked it very much.,75880,4
75881,Great conversation starter... especially this year.,75881,4
75882,This is a great bag!,75882,4
75882,"It's a bit smaller than I anticipated, but I'm perfectly happy with that because I didn't really want a ""black hole"" of a bag.",75882,4
75882,The scarf and smaller bag that came with it are also great.,75882,4
75882,The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit smelly.,75882,4
75882,"It's that ""not leather"" smell, but it's a little more than other products of this nature.",75882,4
75882,"I think over time it will decrease so overall, I think this is a great purchase!",75882,4
75883,Great for pants with small belt loops-,75883,4
75884,I love the traditional clock that displays when it's closed.,75884,4
75884,I just wish it would charge in my cars built in Qi charger.,75884,4
75885,both super cute and trendy.,75885,4
75885,for the price you can't beat it.,75885,4
75885,good quality and fun.,75885,4
75885,makes great gifts too.,75885,4
75886,I like the fit and style.,75886,4
75886,There are two things I would change.,75886,4
75886,"The buttoned flaps on the pockets are difficult to unbutton, and, thus, difficult to access.",75886,4
75886,The knitted cuffs on the sleeves are extremely tight.,75886,4
75886,"If they were buttoned like the stand up collar, they would be more stylish and more comfortable.",75886,4
75887,"I thought it would be a little heavier
But we had an unseasonably warm
Halloween so it worked out well.",75887,4
75888,loved the bright colors and kept my kids feet nice and toasty on cold days - would purchase again,75888,4
75890,Good everyday around the house jeans,75890,4
75891,ordered xlarge and it is a small xl should have gotten xxl.,75891,4
75891,but overall a good shirt,75891,4
75894,It fit me well i guess but then after washing a few time i think it shrank.,75894,4
75894,But i think its a nice shirt overall and looked really nice on me when i first wore it.,75894,4
75895,Very snug at the bust.,75895,4
75897,This enabled me to wear my regular work slacks up until I hit the 3rd trimester.,75897,4
75897,It didn't want to stay in place initially.,75897,4
75897,I had to reach about the 20 week mark for it to really hold everything as it's meant to without having to constantly readjust it.,75897,4
75898,This gown was okay.,75898,4
75898,The material was not as soft as I expected.,75898,4
75899,Material is really good,75899,4
75900,This is a nice tee shirt.,75900,4
75900,"I like the longer sleeves, but I am pretty busty, so it lays a little differently on me than it probably would on a average-sized woman.",75900,4
75901,Very nice and sturdy pair of sunglasses.,75901,4
75903,Bought for my bf's daughter for a costume and she loves them.,75903,4
75904,"cute and comfortable, just wish the material didn't catch so much lint and didn't end up pilling.",75904,4
75905,Thin so wear an undershirt.,75905,4
75906,"Really cute, but the top wore really think by end of summer had to cut off the pretty yellow but other wise nice suit",75906,4
75907,"Material somewhat thinner than expected, but my niece loved it.",75907,4
75908,Birthday girl like it,75908,4
75910,"Nice set, earrings worry me because the backs are hard to get on",75910,4
75911,"a birthday gift for my granddaughter , the top button popped off when she put it on,  it is cute and a little short , but with shorts underneath,  it will work",75911,4
75912,"Works perfect for a small child, but be aware that the pockets won't let you fit more than travel size things in them.",75912,4
75912,There are two slightly larger pockets that were very useful and we put things like the kids toothbrushes in them,75912,4
75913,"Fit well, material is silky feeling, so its more of a warm weather blouse.",75913,4
75915,"IT IS A VERY NICE PRODUCT, FITS WELL AND IS OF GOOD QUALITY.",75915,4
75916,I recommend to get a size bigger.,75916,4
75916,But it very beautiful!,75916,4
75917,The outfit is cute and cotton seems very soft.,75917,4
75917,Will edit when I put it on my boy!,75917,4
75918,"This beanie was actually decently warm, but more importantly it served its purpose (Halloween Costume) perfectly.",75918,4
75918,"I wore this with a yellow shirt, blue suspenders, and jeans and people all seemed to know exactly what I was.",75918,4
75918,I only gave it 4 stars because of its fit.,75918,4
75918,When looking at the photo I assumed this girl might have a smaller head or just be pulling down on the hat or have it angled a certain way and that is why it comes down so far over her eyes.,75918,4
75918,"WRONG, that picture is exactly accurate of how it fits my head (average build male) even after washing.",75918,4
75918,"Because of this I will honestly probably wear it very rarely, and leave it in my closet until Halloween every year.",75918,4
75919,I bought this for my husband and he really likes it.,75919,4
75919,The only negative is that the lighter part that comes out fits pretty loose.,75919,4
75919,It could fall out so you need to be careful.,75919,4
75919,That's the reason why I gave 4 stars.,75919,4
75920,We purchased to put my daughters sand toys to take to the beach.,75920,4
75920,They all fit and the sand was able to fall out.,75920,4
75920,Also a good size for either adult or child.,75920,4
75921,"A bit tight in hip area, there is no give at all.",75921,4
75921,It is a beautiful shirt and high quality.,75921,4
75921,Wore it to Navy hockey game with many compliments.,75921,4
75922,A bit too long.,75922,4
75923,"It fits as I expected it to, however, the belt was very deceiving in the picture.",75923,4
75923,I was under the impression it was a wide belt that was held in place somehow.,75923,4
75923,"When I got it out of the package, it was just a piece of cloth that was hardly long enough to tie around me and it kept slipping away from where the seams are.",75923,4
75923,I'll have to buy a different belt to go with it but overall I'm happy with the purchase.,75923,4
75925,If the fringes was a little more fuller I would have given it 5 stars!,75925,4
75925,Had no trouble with shipping or sizing,75925,4
75926,Just the right size.,75926,4
75926,Liner and snap may not hold up to heavy usage.,75926,4
75926,Great price for this item.,75926,4
75927,Works great at keeping cold AC blowing air off my husband's nerve damaged ear.,75927,4
75927,He says a little uncomfortable but not a problem.,75927,4
75928,Good for its price.,75928,4
75928,A bit see through and thin but cute for simple cosplay.,75928,4
75929,Possibly should've ordered a size up as it is a lil difficult to pull up over torso once you get your bottom adjusted.,75929,4
75929,Can't wear it with most dresses as you will see the lines depending on material but it looks FABULOUS in straight legged or flared fitted jeans.,75929,4
75930,I really like this brand - too cute and it seems to be of decent quality.,75930,4
75931,"The shoe is cute, good rubber sole on the bottom for beginner walkers but NOT TRUE TO SIZE .",75931,4
75931,"I suggest ordering a size down from babys age , but after I contacted seller I was very pleased and look forward to getting the right size shipped to me.",75931,4
75931,Great price and the fur lining is perfect for winter shoes.,75931,4
75931,So if you do order these just make sure you order down a size.,75931,4
75932,I'm very happy with this.,75932,4
75932,I ordered the green in medium.,75932,4
75932,"I'm 5'10"" and my measurements are 34"" 26"" 36"".",75932,4
75932,I could have worn a small but I wanted the sleeves to be long enough.,75932,4
75932,"The fabric is soft and stretchy, it does show the outline of under clothing unfortunately.",75932,4
75932,The color is beautiful and it looks great with tights and a belt.,75932,4
75932,I gave it 4 stars because the back hem is about an inch shorter then the front and because the size chart was a little off.,75932,4
75932,"Instead of being 32"" long it's 35"" which is better for me because I'm tall, now I can wear it as an actual dress not a long shirt but when I order online I rely heavily on the size charts so... Thankfully this worked out.",75932,4
75933,Fit my calves well.,75933,4
75933,They arrived alot faster than I had expected.,75933,4
75934,"It's kind of small on me, but to be fair, I have a LOT of hair.",75934,4
75934,But it gets the job done.,75934,4
75935,The body of the swimsuit fits as expected.,75935,4
75935,"The bra area is way too big, but a bigger bust would fill it out.",75935,4
75935,"Very thin material, not sure how long it will last.",75935,4
75935,Bought it for a music festival so I'll at least get my day out of if.,75935,4
75937,Too small I returned it,75937,4
75938,The jacket was smaller than expected and fits snuggly.,75938,4
75938,"When ordered, it was not available in a larger size.",75938,4
75938,"However, it a great and nicely styled jacket that my daughter likes.",75938,4
75939,Love the bracelet got l,75939,4
75940,"The pant was a bit longer,,",75940,4
75941,"Seems to be a good quality belt, only time and use will determine durability.",75941,4
75941,Really like the ratchet system over the standard hole system.,75941,4
75941,Allows for incremental adjustments of approx.,75941,4
75942,Hangs well stretches well molds to body.,75942,4
75942,Like the length and off center points.,75942,4
75944,"Fit was great, although the black looks more like a deep blue.",75944,4
75947,"Cute sweater and colors are true to the hue, but the material is a bit cheap.",75947,4
75947,( Shows in the fit as the waistline).,75947,4
75947,Would be a far better fit if the bottom of the sweater was not pinched and just hung straight,75947,4
75948,"Very comfortable, warm and soft, perfect for laying around the house in.",75948,4
75948,"Although some of the ""bone"" pieces of fabric were stitched weird and the stitches started to come loose so I had to re-stitch them",75948,4
75949,The necklace is beautiful.,75949,4
75949,It lays nicely when worn.,75949,4
75949,"The only drawback is, it would be nice if the chain was longer.",75949,4
75950,I have a hard time ordering pjs online so I appreciate reviews about fitting.,75950,4
75950,"I usually need to order up a size but I ordered a 3t for my almost 3 yr old, 35 lb son and these fit great.",75950,4
75950,They would have some room for growth too.,75950,4
75950,Pjs are comfy and fun designs.,75950,4
75950,Ordering another design tonight.,75950,4
75951,This is a nice quality..not thin!!!,75951,4
75951,I have four stars only because it was a little right around the back.,75951,4
75951,Otherwise I love it!,75951,4
75952,Looks good and very nicely priced.,75952,4
75952,A tad tight around my face.,75952,4
75952,Have a pretty average head I think!,75952,4
75953,Back ground looked like a dark brown.its black but very cute wish the body was a little longer though.,75953,4
75954,The 11 year old loves his stylish puma shoes.,75954,4
75954,Perfect for walking around europe!,75954,4
75955,The fabric is a little thin but other than that the shirt fit good.,75955,4
75956,Looks more green than blue is reason for 4 stars.,75956,4
75957,A bit see through but over all great product.,75957,4
75957,I can get away with wearing these to the office as well as out and about.,75957,4
75957,"I ordered 3 more in different colors, I wish they were a bit longer for taller ladies",75957,4
75958,I bought it for my husband.,75958,4
75958,It was too small.,75958,4
75958,it's a nice bracelet though.,75958,4
75958,I will keep it for myself.,75958,4
75959,I am very happy with the ear mitts,75959,4
75960,"Cute, my teenager loves it.",75960,4
75961,Pretty and sturdy in person.,75961,4
75961,Color is accurate to the photo the company provided (it looks a little blue in my photo but it is closer to a Tiffany green in person) .,75961,4
75961,The chain is shiny.,75961,4
75961,Seems like it is well made.,75961,4
75961,The triangle design is large enough to make a statement but not so large that it is ridiculous.,75961,4
75961,"But it is a bold, modern design so it won't go with every outfit.",75961,4
75961,The necklace clasps at different lengths.,75961,4
75961,A nice necklace for the price.,75961,4
75961,Hope this was helpful,75961,4
75962,It was a pretty good item.,75962,4
75962,It seems strong and it fits nicely.,75962,4
75962,Nice gift for the price.,75962,4
75963,"Took a while for me to decide whether I will buy this in white size small with the varying reviews, but now I'm glad I did.",75963,4
75963,"I am 5'4"", wear size 2-4, and this fits as expected.",75963,4
75963,"It came in a plastic packaging (see photo) and came out wrinkled, but nothing that can't be undone with ironing or heat drying.",75963,4
75963,"The neckline measures 17.75"" and the bustline was around 36.25"".",75963,4
75963,It did not shrink after washing.,75963,4
75963,"The fabric is light, almost like lawn cotton, breathable, and comfortable.",75963,4
75963,Perfect for spring or summer.,75963,4
75963,No stitches were out of place and I like that.,75963,4
75963,"If it were a better quality cotton, I'd give it 5 stars.",75963,4
75963,But for the price it is a great buy and value.,75963,4
75963,It shipped fast too.,75963,4
75963,The wrist ties provide versatile styling depending on how loosely or tightly these are knotted.,75963,4
75963,"As I am petite, the sleeves reach the top of my wrists, but if I knot the ties tightly, the sleeves can be 3/4 length.",75963,4
75963,"This top goes perfectly well with jeans and pants, tucked and untucked, and with both flats and heels.",75963,4
75963,Its hemline is certainly cut high to the sides as the other reviewers said (see photo).,75963,4
75963,I don't particularly mind this though.,75963,4
75963,I also like it that chest portion of the neckline does not have elastic in them.,75963,4
75963,The elastic starts on both shoulders and runs to the back.,75963,4
75963,"Unlike other off-the-shoulder tops, this one does not ride up my shoulders.",75963,4
75963,"Overall I can see myself using this a lot, and would like to buy the other colors too.",75963,4
75964,"The tie is fine, just a little narrower than I was hoping for.",75964,4
75964,It was the best of the rest I found and I wear it frequently (I'm a piano player in a restaurant where I live).,75964,4
75967,Not made in USA but printed in USA.,75967,4
75967,Would get 5 stars if made in USA.,75967,4
75968,I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband.,75968,4
75968,It's a warm and nice looking!,75968,4
75968,Unfortunately after two weeks of wearing it the inside lining is coming unstitched from the outer hat.,75968,4
75968,"I can fix it, but it's too bad that a fix is needed already.",75968,4
75968,Thus the 4 star rating.,75968,4
75968,Otherwise it's a 5!,75968,4
75969,The color is not the same as shows at the picture..,75969,4
75969,But is a beautiful dark blue and cute large blouse,75969,4
75970,This dress  was great.,75970,4
75970,I received so many compliments on New Years Eve.,75970,4
75971,Nice hat a little large and the straps only adjust so far.,75971,4
75971,I had to see it up on the sides.,75971,4
75971,I have a small head.,75971,4
75971,I'm sure it will be fine for adult size heads.,75971,4
75973,This cardigan is what I was expecting.,75973,4
75973,It is warm and fits me as I wanted (a bit baggy).,75973,4
75973,"Yes, it came with a funny smell, but I got rid of it after I washed it.",75973,4
75973,"The finishing is not perfect, but that is OK considering the price.",75973,4
75973,Looks great with jeans and a colorful scarf.,75973,4
75975,love the color but it is alittle tight.,75975,4
75975,Will lose some weight and then wear it.,75975,4
75977,Preferred beige but the pink is ok good for spring / summer,75977,4
75978,Super soft and snuggly.,75978,4
75978,I ordered the pair in size 6 months a few moths ago.,75978,4
75978,Lately he does not fit size 6 mo pajama's and clothes but these pajama's still fit.,75978,4
75978,I am really happy with this purchase.,75978,4
75979,"I bought this hat for my husband, and he loves the material and breathability.",75979,4
75980,The toe of the  boot rubbed off with in the first two times wearing them.,75980,4
75980,Otherwise they are nice.,75980,4
75981,"The dress is pretty, nice material.",75981,4
75981,I suggest ordered the dress one size bigger than your US size.,75981,4
75981,I normally wear xs or s in US and fit in size 4 which is a M for this dress.,75981,4
75981,"This dress can be worn at cocktail party, it has an elegant look to it.",75981,4
75981,* I received this dress in exchange for an honest review*,75981,4
75982,"This is my second pair, the arch support is not as prominent as my first pair.",75982,4
75982,But I can wear them all day and walk and it's definitely more comfortable for me.,75982,4
75982,"I especially like that I can adjust them, I needed to make them much more narrow to start.",75982,4
75983,I bought this polo to test its quality for field work.,75983,4
75983,It wears good and looks nice.,75983,4
75983,"I plan to buy several to use as my ""nice"" uniform when visiting clients.",75983,4
75984,Gift and she loved it!,75984,4
75985,The color was a perfect match to what was advertised and the fabric was a good quality especially for the price.,75985,4
75985,When I put it on the bottoms fit perfect and looked nice.,75985,4
75985,My only complaint is that the top has zero support to hold up my huge 36G boobs.,75985,4
75985,I think this would be perfect for someone with smaller boobs.,75985,4
75986,It looks good on me and keeps me warm in fall.,75986,4
75986,This is the purpose i bought it for and it serves that perfectly.,75986,4
75986,The fleece inside is comfortable and soft.,75986,4
75986,"I am 5' 1"" , 130Lb and this fits great on my body.",75986,4
75986,"Only issue is the build, I am not sure whether it was only the one I bought but for all the products, the threads near the ankle started tearing and I had to stitch it again to make sure the whole leg does not get tore off.",75986,4
75987,"This ring functions properly and is decent looking, but when it arrived it was much larger than I was expecting.",75987,4
75987,"It tells you this, but really keep in mind that the length listed is not the diameter of the ring but the length of the bar in the middle.",75987,4
75987,This ring hangs low.,75987,4
75987,"I was looking for something slightly more understated, but no worries.",75987,4
75987,I'll still be wearing it.,75987,4
75987,I would recommend this to someone who wants something more flashy.,75987,4
75988,Thought they were gonna be Good but after about two weeks of wearing then the color rubbed off and irritated my nipples :(,75988,4
75989,The first pair that I ordered via the size chart were too small.,75989,4
75989,I went with a medium.,75989,4
75989,"The return process was not difficult, so I went ahead and purchased the two pack in a large.",75989,4
75989,"I am about 5'7"" 140 pounds with hip size 36"".",75989,4
75989,They were so worth returning as they are not see through and are great for working out in.,75989,4
75989,They shipped quickly as well!,75989,4
75991,This dress is ADORABLE and my daughter loves it.,75991,4
75991,Is on the thinner side material wise.,75991,4
75992,it was very large but it was very cute and soft and they really got it here before christmas which i apprecieated.,75992,4
75993,Like other reviews that I should have read...,75993,4
75993,I ordered light purple and got pink.,75993,4
75993,"Other than the color discrepancy, the dress is lovely and a perfect fit.",75993,4
75993,Will be ordering more in different colors!,75993,4

75996,"A little longer than Carters, in our car a positive.",75996,4
75996,My daughter wishes there were less snaps when dealing with a 3 am feeding.,75996,4
75996,It would be nice to have a little animal instead of the logo.,75996,4
75997,I wear a medium and the large is almost too small,75997,4
75998,Based on the sizing chart it is a little large but overall a nice jersey.,75998,4
75999,Easily adjustable openings to fit the largest of baby toes sized nips.,75999,4
75999,These things make your chesticles look amazing and aren't to hard on the teats.,75999,4
76000,"Bought this hat for my son, and yes he likes it",76000,4
76001,"Fit as expect d, I wear a women's medium.",76001,4
76003,"It came a day early but it looks really dark almost a black unless you show it in light then it's a very dark purple, it also doesn't come with a chain.",76003,4
76003,other than that it comes as expected.,76003,4
76004,This belt is very cute.,76004,4
76004,"The design is true to the image and it fits will in most of my jeans, even the shorts!",76004,4
76004,It has a hidden bottle opener in the buckle (which I find amusing) and is all around comfortable.,76004,4
76004,I've gotten many compliments as I let my nerd flag fly.,76004,4
76004,The main reason I do not give it five stars is sometimes the fastener becomes unhinged at random.,76004,4
76004,"If I loosen it by an  inch, or torque it down then it clicks properly into place.",76004,4
76004,"Could be a design flaw, I'm not sure.",76004,4
76005,I purchased this tie dye top for an outdoor festival.,76005,4
76005,It's a nice thin shirt and very comfortable.,76005,4
76005,But I have a bigger bust size and it's a little form fitting instead of flowing.,76005,4
76005,I should have bought an extra large instead of a large.,76005,4
76005,I do recommend it.,76005,4
76007,Have to adjust the straps in back because I ordered a little larger and when I bend over or move the wrong way my breasts fall out.,76007,4
76008,Really pretty skirt and seemed well made.,76008,4
76008,My waist is 31 inches and I wanted a little bit of room so I ordered the XXL.,76008,4
76008,Unfortunately it was at least 2 inches too big.,76008,4
76009,Perfect fit and comfortable,76009,4
76010,"It's a beautiful jumper, but size chart is off.",76010,4
76010,Go up one size.,76010,4
76010,Had a small issue with the chest area.,76010,4
76010,"There is a button to keep everything in place, I just felt it was placed lower than it should've been.",76010,4
76011,Just what i wanted.,76011,4
76011,Glasses have a home.,76011,4
76011,I bought like 5 or them..,76011,4
76012,My granddaughter loved it,76012,4
76013,Great dress for the price!,76013,4
76014,This is so cute!,76014,4
76014,My only minor issue is that the padded cups move around in the bra while I'm wearing it.,76014,4
76014,I think I'll sew them in place.,76014,4
76014,Overall love how this fits and looks.,76014,4
76015,Loved the material..  the sleeves are tight but its ok.. the quality is perfect!,76015,4
76016,These socks are pretty cute.,76016,4
76016,They fell down more often than I would want but my daughter is 2 so I'm thinking she's a bit small for them.,76016,4
76016,Overall I like them,76016,4
76017,But remember they will stretch as u wear them.,76017,4
76018,This would be a  favorite piece if it was just a little bigger.,76018,4
76018,I wear a sz 10-12 and this is a little smaller then I like.,76018,4
76018,I LOVE the soft feel and the way it drapes.,76018,4
76019,"Cute bag, lots of compartments.",76019,4
76019,The material will wipe clean easy.,76019,4
76020,Shoe is very soft and great grip for new walkers.,76020,4
76020,The size runs a little larger than expect but they last longer that way.,76020,4
76020,The white does get dirty easily but it also very easy to clean off.,76020,4
76020,Over all a great product.,76020,4
76021,Just what we imagined.,76021,4
76021,Just right for the job.,76021,4
76022,This is a great dress!!!,76022,4
76022,"For the price, it cannot be beat, it looks like an expensive dress!",76022,4
76022,"I ordered a medium, I am a 34D and surprisingly the bust area was a little big, luckily the straps ARE adjustable.",76022,4
76022,I usually wear a medium in dresses (I have a fuller bottom) and this medium fits a tad bit larger than what I am typically used to.,76022,4
76022,I would say order your normal size and you will be fine!,76022,4
76022,"Again, beautiful dress - looks exactly like the picture.",76022,4
76023,My husband and I have lots of matching rings to signify our togetherness.,76023,4
76023,"Since just before we got married, this has been our thing; however, this ring stains slightly because our skin/sweat is too acidic for the metal (not sterling silver) - too much nickel?",76023,4
76025,The material is thin but very stretchy and seems like it will hold up.,76025,4
76025,They are cool and comfortable.,76025,4
76025,They qash up really nicely.,76025,4
76026,Very long but I am a short girl.,76026,4
76027,Nice baggy sweater.at first felt a little itchy but then after wearing it a little it softened up nice.,76027,4
76027,I got the red wine color and it is very nice.,76027,4
76027,Arrived earlier than I expected.,76027,4
76028,Is a cute dress... fit right but if you have a big breast I don't think will fit...,76028,4
76028,I'm 34 b and it just right little  thigh if I wear a push up bra...  my be u just need to unbuttoned the chest area...,76028,4
76028,I will give 5 star if the price little bit cheaper... comparing the quality and the price I think it this is little bit to expensive.,76028,4
76030,"Somewhat small, but it was effective.",76030,4
76031,i got my package through DHL.,76031,4
76031,"they were having issues delivering it to my place of work for some reason so i didn't get it right on time but blame dhl overall great product i do suggest getting it a size bigger because even tho i fit in it, it was still a bit small.",76031,4
76032,I've had the shirt a few months now and its handling normal wear and tear nicely.,76032,4
76033,These are beautiful and only irritated my sensitive ears a little.,76033,4
76033,The only reason I am giving a 4 instead of 5 is that they are a bit bigger than what I could call a huggie..,76033,4
76034,"Smells bad when I got it, but after one wash it was all okay.",76034,4
76034,Also it's a bit shorter than I thought it would be.,76034,4
76035,I love the color (purple).,76035,4
76035,It fits really nice and actually look good tucked into slacks.,76035,4
76035,It drapes well and I think it is flattering.,76035,4
76036,"I LIKE THEM,COULD BE A BIT LONGER.",76036,4
76037,JUST WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.....UNDERPANTS,76037,4
76039,Haven't yet used them but they seem very high quality.,76039,4
76040,I got a pair of these for my husband for Christmas.,76040,4
76041,The color of this dress is so rich & beautiful.,76041,4
76041,It is very comfortable & long.,76041,4
76041,My only dissatisfaction with this item is that there are a few seams that needed to be restitched.,76041,4
76041,Luckily my mom is a seamstress & she fixed it for me.,76041,4
76041,I would definitely purchase this dress in another color.,76041,4
76042,Loving this card holder so far!,76042,4
76042,"I have 6-7 cards in it, and it will have some room for a few bills.",76042,4
76042,"It feels fairly durable with a nice finish...but I've only been using for a few weeks so, I'll update after a few months.",76042,4
76042,"The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I wish it could hold at least a few more cards/bills...if you put too much inside, it will open and won't stay shut.",76042,4
76042,Maybe make a unit slightly larger for those of us with more cards?,76042,4
76043,Love how this looks on my dad.,76043,4
76043,XL was a good fit.,76043,4
76043,My only critique is that it seems it will require ironing.,76043,4
76043,Otherwise I'm very happy.,76043,4
76044,"Pros: bag is cute, good size for travel, love the compartment organizer.",76044,4
76044,I think it is a neat idea.,76044,4
76044,"Cons: hard to zip the zipper, keep getting stuck at the corner",76044,4
76045,I bought this dress as part of a costume.,76045,4
76045,"I like it, it fit my body shape, and it is reasonably priced for what I had in mind,  but it is made for a tall person.",76045,4
76045,Even with 5 inch heels it was just too long for me.,76045,4
76047,This is my favorite ring to wear in my nipples.,76047,4
76047,It doesn't snag or pull.,76047,4
76047,I also love that it's a captive bead without requiring special pliers.,76047,4
76047,Only downfall is that the skull rusts with my water.,76047,4
76047,"I, unfortunately, have well water here in South Florida.",76047,4
76047,"The water is ""hard"".",76047,4
76047,"Other than that, love them.",76047,4
76048,I usually wear a small or an XS but for this I ordered a large after reading other comments -and thank goodness I read the other comments!!!,76048,4
76048,Very nice however the sizes are completely off.,76048,4
76048,Beautiful but make sure to order 2-3 sizes larger than what you are.,76048,4
76049,Just a tiny bit bigger than expected.,76049,4
76050,"larger than a normal XL, nice quality, but not a super soft cotton.",76050,4
76051,Nice pajamas for my in-law.,76051,4
76051,"The quality is great, although it could be a bit thicker, especially for the elderly.",76051,4
76051,"The size is as expected, and the color is exactly as pictured.",76051,4
76052,"The nurse hat is not like in the pic but whatever, the dress itself was not as tight as I would have liked it.",76052,4
76052,and the thong was way to large.,76052,4
76052,I'm 5'1 105 lbs and slim.,76052,4
76053,"A bit lower quality than expected, but did the job.",76053,4
76054,It's a very light/thin shirt.,76054,4
76054,"The area where the palm trees is, is a bit rubbery.",76054,4
76054,Would I buy it again?,76054,4
76055,I really like this romper!,76055,4
76055,It looks really cute.,76055,4
76055,I'm always afraid of how things will fit me but its good.,76055,4
76055,"Im almost 5'8"" and i have a bigger back side and thighs but a small waist..size 12 in pants.",76055,4
76055,But this fits well.,76055,4
76055,"Only thing is the elastic waistband has gotten somewhat ""tangled"" inside but not too big of a deal.",76055,4
76056,The poop emoji faded very easily after washing & I could see the tie-dye under it when I first bought it.,76056,4
76056,My daughter loves this shirt and wore it so much lol.,76056,4
76057,good summer sweater for over Tshirts,76057,4
76058,The material is thick and soft.,76058,4
76058,It doesn't quite fit as flattering as I had expected because it's a bit too large.,76058,4
76058,The color is very pretty and the accent buttons are unique.,76058,4
76058,I will return it and most likely purchase it in a smaller size.,76058,4
76060,Dress was well made.,76060,4
76060,I did order 1size larger and it fit nicely.,76060,4
76060,Some of the sequins were falling off.,76060,4
76061,It will go well with as an accessory to one of my dresses.,76061,4
76062,"Very pretty and very good quality, just a tad smaller than expected.",76062,4
76063,the shirt fits around the body as expected but the sleeves are about 1.5 inches short.,76063,4
76063,Also the neck line is a bit odd.,76063,4
76063,"But for the price, cute shirt",76063,4
76065,"Looks like the photo, fitted me just fine.",76065,4
76065,I don't know what else to say.,76065,4
76065,I got it fast ( I am a Prime member ) and I really was happy to get it.,76065,4
76065,These days for me are hard to find things that fit me.,76065,4
76065,"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and was put on Lyrica.",76065,4
76065,"Well, just as one of the side affects said, I gained weight.",76065,4
76065,I went to weighing 115 ( all my life ) to 170 in a matter of months.,76065,4
76065,I had to buy new clothes.,76065,4
76065,It was really hard for me to pick out clothes.,76065,4
76065,I had to keep buying different sizes.,76065,4
76065,I couldn't wear all the cute clothes I once wore.,76065,4
76065,I became severely self conscious.,76065,4
76065,"I found myself buying clothes that covered my stomach, arms,....",76065,4
76065,Things I never had to worry about all my life.,76065,4
76065,So this dress was just fine with me.,76065,4
76065,"It is short, just as the photo shows, so I wore some basic shorts under it.",76065,4
76065,"I recommend it to anyone, whatever size you are, assuming it comes in your size.",76065,4
76066,"the medium size of the jacket do not size me, i want large size",76066,4
76068,"While these earrings are poorly constructed, they're beautiful in the way they're crafted.",76068,4
76068,The earrings have a hand made feel and are a bit of a diy project.,76068,4
76068,"First time I wore them a small piece where the pin pushes into detached from the wing, so I simply pushed it back in and glued it together.",76068,4
76068,"Also, black came off small bottom part of one of the earrings, so I took a black sharpie and colored it in.",76068,4
76068,Now the earrings are perfect and look quite amazing on my ears.,76068,4
76069,"Color was great, nice large brim",76069,4
76070,"I wore it to work the day it arrived, just to see what people would say.",76070,4
76070,"At first I got comments like ""that vest suits you"" or ""interesting pockets"", but it wasn't too long before I got the knowing nod of a Star Wars fan.",76070,4
76071,The top is cute but absolutely see through.,76071,4
76071,I was able to finagle it with a bra but it took some work.,76071,4
76071,The skirt is cheap looking and the slit on mine is too close to the front!,76071,4
76071,Will wear the top but not the skirt.,76071,4
76072,"Cute, much much brighter orange though.",76072,4
76072,"More traffic cone orange, but other than that cute and fits and is very cozy.",76072,4
76073,Nice looking watch at a very good price,76073,4
76074,I bought this shoes for my little brother's birthday and he absolutely loves it.,76074,4
76074,I have no cons for this product except for the shoe size because it turned out a little bigger than expected.,76074,4
76074,"But overall, this shoes has a very nice design and it is very light!",76074,4
76074,I think it's a great shoes for little boys to wear.,76074,4
76075,It looks very nice!,76075,4
76076,The hat brings back memories of the place far far away and a lifetime ago where far too many of us  never came home,76076,4
76077,Arrived promptly and fit great.,76077,4
76077,Very happy with the purchase.,76077,4
76078,i expected my waist trainer to fit a little more tighter than what it is fitting.,76078,4
76078,is it any way i can ship this one back to you for an exchange of a small ?,76078,4
76079,"Decent quality, nothing wrong.",76079,4
76079,I purchased this for a Mary Poppins costume.,76079,4
76079,It fit fine and stayed on all night.,76079,4
76080,This is a good looking tie and I received it on time.,76080,4
76081,"Can't change the size, so a bit larger for those who have slim wrists.",76081,4
76081,Not a dedicated bracelet but chic chic.,76081,4
76082,I wish there was an extra small.,76082,4
76082,"While the body part fits well, the sleeves are saggy, even on the small.",76082,4
76082,"Also, in the picture it appears that it fits more like a thong than full coverage underwear, but it is full coverage.",76082,4
76082,"Not exactly what was expected, but still sexy for the price.",76082,4
76083,I struggled between 4 or 5 stars.,76083,4
76083,"It fits as expected, and as far as the chemical smell... it is very faint, i am going to wash it before I wrap it and since the smell is so faint I for see it coming out in one wash.",76083,4
76083,"I also gave 4 stars as supposed to 5 because I feel it could be thicker, if one were to wear a winter hat/ beanie underneath then it should be warm enough to with stand the cold for.",76083,4
76083,"When wearing the front can be used as a small pockets, but i am assuming what the actual purpose is for is to fold/ ball it up when one is.done using it.",76083,4
76083,I would recommend this but would prefer it to be thicker for the cold weather.,76083,4
76084,"I purchased this in the green, size Medium.",76084,4
76084,"I'm 5'3"" with a short torso and long arms, 34/28/38.",76084,4
76084,"I was indecisive on whether to order a Small, but went up a size figuring that the front would be a little more modest, and because inadequate sleeve length is a common issue for me.",76084,4
76084,The sleeves are long enough and there is no extra material bagging anywhere.,76084,4
76084,"That being said I definitely could have gone with a Small since it's so stretchy, and the neckline opening would have more closely resembled the model.",76084,4
76084,"The fabric is thick enough to go braless, which is good because there is no bra that plunges deep enough to be concealed..",76084,4
76084,Outer fabric is soft and slightly shiny (not so shiny that the item looks cheap...pretty much exactly like the picture).,76084,4
76084,"The inside is the same material, but appears to have been brushed, so it's extra plush and soft against the skin.",76084,4
76084,I find it very comfortable.,76084,4
76084,Shipping was ahead of schedule and packaging was adequate.,76084,4
76084,This is actually very similar to the Free People 'layering' bodysuit at a fraction of the price!,76084,4
76085,"It's not too small, per se.",76085,4
76085,Needs to be worn and stretched a little,76085,4
76086,Big loose and cool.,76086,4
76086,silky feeling material but very thin/see through.,76086,4
76086,You will definately need to wear a tank or at minimum a sports bra underneath.,76086,4
76086,Great with jeans for almost any occasion.,76086,4
76087,its really nice...looks like the picture.. smooth surface is ok would rather have the more vintage feel but I like it a lot,76087,4
76088,"I'm going to have to see what effect that it actually has on my shoes, but it was a good value buy, and one can sprayed thoroughly 11 pairs of shoes and 3 hats.",76088,4
76090,happy with the product,76090,4
76091,"The sizing fits me kind of weird, im 5'4"", size 34c, weigh 135lbs, the length fits me good, i don't feel ""too reveling"" on the backside (but this depends on your own personality, and honestly i don't plan on wearing it out of the water without a cover up anyway, just like any other bathingsuit) however the top part feels a bit too snug.",76091,4
76091,"I don't have big breast at all, and any bigger it would be really uncomfortable.",76091,4
76091,"This will work for me, it doesnt look on me like i was hoping it would, but its not bad either.",76091,4
76091,"But i did receive this before expected date, which was nice!",76091,4
76093,"I have 5'8 and 140 and needed an XL, I have a long waist though.",76093,4
76093,Tons of compliments though!,76093,4
76094,Super cute- my daughter loves this.,76094,4
76094,"I wanted to like the bubble design, but I feel like it just drops all the water on her (or me if I'm using it after running her to school;)",76094,4
76095,The spark is off a little.,76095,4
76096,"The skirt has a nice flowing movement to it when walking, and though it is not lined you can't see through the material.",76096,4
76096,I am pleased with what I received for this price range.,76096,4
76099,"The pantsuit is beautiful...the length is too long for me, but it is worth having an inexpensive alteration.",76099,4
76100,I GOT THE XL BEING 5'10_165LBS AND THE FIT IS GREAT!,76100,4
76100,I HAVE 10+ PAIRS NOW.,76100,4
76100,VERY SOFT & COMFORTABLE.,76100,4
76100,HOLDS UP FINE IN WASH THEN I HANG DRY.,76100,4
76100,WELL MADE AND DURABLE.,76100,4
76100,PRICE IS GREAT BUT THE SHIPPING IS AS MUCH AS THE CAPRIS!,76100,4
76102,I originally found this brand in either a TJ Maxx or a Marshalls (I can't remember) and ended up loving it for the price.,76102,4
76102,I've since come on to Amazon to buy more as needed.,76102,4
76102,They are fantastic for the money.,76102,4
76102,"They're soft, comfortable, not see-through, they don't show sweat (at least not the black, I've had other black pants that do), matte (I hate shiny pants!",76102,4
76102,"), and they hold up to multiple wearings & washings.",76102,4
76102,The biggest negative is that they do eventually stretch out so that I'm constantly pulling them back up during any high-impact exercise.,76102,4
76102,And I've found this particular pair runs slightly big.,76102,4
76102,"I'm 5'3"" and usually wear a size 8, I ordered a  medium and it fits well if I wasn't wearing them for exercise, but a little loose in the waist for exercise (have to pull them up on occassion).",76102,4
76102,"But my body style is bigger hips to smaller waist, so it's not unexpected.",76102,4
76102,I think if I went down to a small they'd probably be too tight (i.e.,76102,4
76102,"So for cheap money, these are great!",76102,4
76103,Good ear rings wife liked them,76103,4
76104,"It is very nice, but it is definitely falsely advertised - mine says 50% viscose, 50% acrylic.",76104,4
76104,"It feels and looks very nice and the color is beautiful, they should just correct the description.",76104,4
76105,My granddaughter is 10 months so I bought the 12 month product based on previous reviews of this product running small.,76105,4
76106,I would have loved it if it fit.,76106,4
76107,I love it and it matches the outfit that I bought it for perfectly.,76107,4
76108,"The box was excellent quality, I was very impressed to unpack it when it arrived.",76108,4
76108,"I really really like the box, though we did end up returning it, as it was just a little too big for our needs.",76108,4
76108,"Regardless, I would still recommend it to someone looking for a product like this.",76108,4
76108,The slots for glasses should easily accommodate glasses of all sizes.,76108,4
76109,it fit like supost to and color was ok wish flet more like animal and better color looking.,76109,4
76109,but will do.came on time and in good boxes.,76109,4
76110,"Other than being a little tight, this shirt was great for my ugly Christmas sweater party!",76110,4
76111,The dress is made of a stretchy soft material and the print is nice.,76111,4
76111,I am a US medium and ordered a China 2XL.,76111,4
76111,It is a little loose but I have boobs and a booty so I was paranoid about the sizing.,76111,4
76111,"Just for reference, I am 5'3 and 160 with an somewhere  between athletic to average build(I like my squats).",76111,4
76111,The dress does run a little short but nothing that I wouldn't wear out.,76111,4
76111,"Just fyi, it does ship from China so I had no idea where it was till it got to the US .It was earlier than the projected delivery so that was cool.",76111,4
76111,Overall it was a great purchase.,76111,4
76111,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the confusion over sizing.,76111,4
76111,It should be more clear.,76111,4
76111,Thank you to the other lady that posted she ordered a 2XL as a medium!,76111,4
76112,It runs small but it still was beautiful I gave it to my granddaughter,76112,4
76113,"I misread this and thought ""22"" was the quantity rather than the chain length.",76113,4
76113,"I had bought this as party favors, but ended up just having the birthday boy wear it.",76113,4
76114,Some of the designs are too small to make out.,76114,4
76115,"These work great; I'm using the two smallest sets, as even the 8mm are pretty large and heavy.",76115,4
76115,I just wish I could buy more of the small ones without purchasing the entire set.,76115,4
76115,"I have sensitive ears (I do ok with surgical stainless earrings), and don't seem to be having irritation issues that some others mentioned in their reviews.",76115,4
76115,"The posts take me a little bit of wiggling & manipulation to insert, since they are slightly larger diameter than standard earrings, but all in all its pretty painless.",76115,4
76115,I purchased these to basically leave in place for extended periods of time  & they'e perfect for that.,76115,4
76116,"Very cute and it firs
I thought it would Be too big
But it's not and I Love that it's
More cotton cooler in the summer
If you live where it's 107 for today lol",76116,4
76117,Bought this bag as an alternative to my backpack/diaper bag.,76117,4
76117,Fits lots of stuff.,76117,4
76117,Does have a few small inside separation pockets that I wish were a bit bigger.,76117,4
76117,Other than that I really like this bag.,76117,4
76118,Decent quality for the price.,76118,4
76118,Gems aren't as vibrant as in the photos.,76118,4
76119,I haven't washed it yet so hoping it survives the wash.  Quality isn't top of the road but cute dress and if it washes well and I can get a season out of it things will be great!,76119,4
76120,I purchased this item for my 2.5 year old son to wear at a wedding.,76120,4
76120,"One item of note is that the main color running through the suspenders other than green, is quite difficult to decipher, in my opinion.",76120,4
76120,In certain lights we'd swear it was navy blue.,76120,4
76120,But in other lights we thought it black.,76120,4
76120,"Although that might not seem like a big deal, when you're trying to tie in other accessories to match, it is indeed frustrating - and meanwhile the bowtie definitely looked black.",76120,4
76120,"We actually wound up using the suspenders but then used a different bowtie which was more colorful (and actually had green, black and blue in it!",76120,4
76120,"), since we found the solid colored bow tie that was provided a bit boring.",76120,4
76120,"For functionality, I'd give this set a 5 stars, but since the coloring seemed so wishy-washy to me, I gave it 4 stars instead.",76120,4
76121,Straps little tight but probably comparing to much to suits I've had a while and might be stretched out.,76121,4
76121,I would purchase this brand again.,76121,4
76122,Fit was a bit large.,76122,4
76122,Probably could have gone down one size.,76122,4
76122,Most people did not recognize this dress as Khaleesi.,76122,4
76123,Second time ordering this.,76123,4
76123,The first one was better than the second one.,76123,4
76123,The first one was cream and was great but ripped so I ordered a black one and ordered it a size up (the first one rolled down).,76123,4
76123,The clips on the black one have not worked they come undone all the time and since it is a size up it fits very well and very comfortably so the clips shouldn't be a problem.,76123,4
76123,After a few wears it started to roll down also a little at the top.,76123,4
76123,I do love the product.,76123,4
76125,This dress fits nearly perfectly; just be sure to use the Homeyee sizing chart (in pictures) and not the Amazon sizing chart link.,76125,4
76125,"The quality is great, and not just for the price.",76125,4
76125,Both the fabric and the stitching are very well done and even.,76125,4
76125,"Fabric is fairly thick, so nothing is see-through.",76125,4
76125,"I'm 5'5"", 32G bust, 30 waist, and 39 hips, and I ordered an XL.",76125,4
76125,"The waist is every so slightly not as fitted, but I can easily take in the excess material.",76125,4
76125,The only reason that I did not give this product 5 stars is because the yellow portion of the dress does not go down as far as the picture on me.,76125,4
76125,"I was really hoping that it would go down to my waist, but it only covers the bust area on me.",76125,4
76125,"I saw other user's pictures, and they did not have the same problem, so it's probably just my ladies taking up too much real estate.",76125,4
76125,"The dress is very striking, and my husband loves it.",76125,4
76125,I just think it calls a bit more attention to my bust than I typically like.,76125,4
76126,"Great fit, although I like the tube top version better.",76126,4
76126,"This one didn't have the elastic to pull the material close where the material comes together, whereas the tube top version does.",76126,4
76126,"But had I NOT tried that dress as well, I would love it!",76126,4
76126,"I don't have a picture of THIS one, but I'll post a picture of the one I kept, which is the same company, same material, etc.",76126,4
76126,Super comfy and fits as expected.,76126,4
76127,The box is nice but the pins were out of order.,76127,4
76127,"As for the pins themselves, Lets just say it's cheap for a reason.",76127,4
76127,The quality isn't bad at all but I expected a more sharper design.,76127,4
76127,This one looks a bit too amateur made.,76127,4
76127,"Overall, It's a nice pin set but if you want high quality, Look else where.",76127,4
76128,I only gave this 4 stars because of the misrepresented color description.,76128,4
76128,The color is called red - but it looks more like coral online.,76128,4
76128,"I asked a product question and received an answer stating that it really is coral, which is exactly what I was looking for :).",76128,4
76128,"Otherwise, the fit is good and the material is so soft.",76128,4
76128,"Definitely not red, it is coral.",76128,4
76129,"The size up was too big, these fit exact, so my niece won't be wearing them too long.",76129,4
76131,Actually fits much better then I expected.,76131,4
76131,Hugs my body without being constructing.,76131,4
76131,Only down side is it seems to be fading already after wearing it twice,76131,4
76132,"First off, I want to start off saying it is a bit large upon opening it, so if you're top heavy, don't worry about it.",76132,4
76132,"Although, I did wash it in the washer on warm because I needed it to shrink and shrink it did to the perfect size.",76132,4
76132,"It's a gorgeous dress, very flattering.",76132,4
76133,Cute dress.. fit's as expected.. A little long but no problem to shorten..,76133,4
76133,Colors are as shown..,76133,4
76134,It was perfect for my bachlorette night.,76134,4
76135,Product is very good and classy.,76135,4
76135,"However, I am giving it 4 stars as it is really meant to hold 5-6 cards only, nothing else, which does not suit my purpose.",76135,4
76135,I could not fit a few money notes after putting 6 cards and that makes it difficult to use as a wallet.,76135,4
76135,I will look for an alternative.,76135,4
76136,God quality but more of a tshirt fit than fitted,76136,4
76138,I can barely give this 4 stars.,76138,4
76138,"While it is clearly a Dawn of Justice cowl, and cheaper than most other cowls out there, unfortunately in this sense you get what you pay for.",76138,4
76138,There are blemishes and pinholes all throughout and it just looks crude.,76138,4
76138,The inside also smells terrible.,76138,4
76138,It also came stuffed in a small box with no protection which creased it and bent it so it became misshapen.,76138,4
76138,The eyes are a bit too small and you have to cut the mouth hole out yourself which I found personally to be tedious and a bit aggravating.,76138,4
76138,Not to mention that as a whole it is far too big.,76138,4
76138,It's decent for the price I guess but it definitely needs some work,76138,4
76139,Love the color and love the fit,76139,4
76140,"this is a GREAT shoe for soccer, but it is a big tight, I would 1/2 size bigger.",76140,4
76141,This is a nice scarf but not quite the color I expected.,76141,4
76141,It leans a little more to the red spectrum of purple than pictured.,76141,4
76141,I am dissapoointed but not surprised.,76141,4
76141,I keep trying to buy a purple scarf to match a specific outfit and haven't had any luck.,76141,4
76141,"Despite the fact that I have bought many other items online, including clothes and scarves, that have arrived true to color the purples seem to be difficult to match online.",76141,4
76141,The quality of the scarf is very nice.,76141,4
76141,If it was the color I see on my screen I would love it.,76141,4
76141,For now I will just keep trying to find the right color purple.,76141,4
76142,I love this dress looks like the picture only problem is that the bottom is more of a thong then boy shirts and the top of the dress would not stay up so I have to get it sewn to fit,76142,4
76143,"This pendant really exceeded my expectations, especially for the price; it is really nice.",76143,4
76143,I have ordered other jewelry from sellers on amazon and have been disappointed before.,76143,4
76143,Not the case with this one.,76143,4
76143,"The material is not heavy, but it is well made.",76143,4
76143,"It's obvious the tree is just a printed out image, a bit pixelated, as if they saved it on their computer and printed it on a color printer lol, but you can only tell when you look at it closely.",76143,4
76143,"My husband complemented it, saying what pretty pendant it was (he hates fake jewelry!",76143,4
76143,"LOL)
The chain is a nice silver color, it's obvious it's not silver, but just like the image, it's nice enough.",76143,4
76143,"No rough edges, or sharp sides.",76143,4
76143,"It has a lobster claw clasp, and it's a nice length, just long enough to be seen.",76143,4
76143,Satisfied with my purchase.,76143,4
76144,It was just what I wanted but not for tall men,76144,4
76145,"Ordered a size up (normally a M, ordered a L) and it fits great!",76145,4
76145,"The material is definitely on the clingier side, so don't expect it to be super flowy or anything, but its very cute and kind of a casual/dressy shirt.",76145,4
76146,Good weight and true to size,76146,4
76147,Fit was true to size.,76147,4
76148,JUST A LITTLE SMALL BUT STILL LOVE THIS SHIRT,76148,4
76149,Super cute an comfy but the seams are uneven and a little loose.,76149,4
76150,It fits as expected,76150,4
76151,They're a pretty good size for most thin ties.,76151,4
76152,Perfect size and good quality.,76152,4
76152,"I was expecting the detail to be a bit more textured, but it's a little smooth in some parts, so the detail isn't as deeply stamped and looks ""faded"" so to say.",76152,4
76153,"I like this shirt, but the top button was broken.",76153,4
76153,If the button was not broken I would have given it  five stars.,76153,4
76154,Will see how well they endure.,76154,4
76155,"We can tell from the picture that this is a somewhat plain T-shirt, but I added an iron-on to make it really special.",76155,4
76155,"I gave it four stars because it's cute, fits as expected, and reasonably priced.",76155,4
76155,"BUT, it's really thin.",76155,4
76155,"Don't buy it thinking this is is winter garb, it's not, not even in Texas.",76155,4
76155,"So, she'll need to either wear something under or over it in cool weather.",76155,4
76156,Most definitely my favorite bag!,76156,4
76156,Just love the space and ease of use.,76156,4
76156,Very happy with purchase.,76156,4
76157,Size fit great other than length.,76157,4
76157,It is quite a bit longer than expected and is difficult to try and hem short due to material.,76157,4
76157,Its beautiful and my daughters it.,76157,4
76158,I have a larger head plus I really have to stuff all my hair in there.,76158,4
76158,It works fine for me but I tie once around and bobby pin it in 4 spots.,76158,4
76158,"It stays in place at night and in the morning my hair is free from tangles and frizz which is the main reason for purchasing, so it satisfied my need.",76158,4
76159,"It's a little too small for me, but the material is really nice and soft.",76159,4
76159,I wear it all the time!,76159,4
76160,"The material is really soft and, while my measurements are a little bigger than the model's, it fits really well!",76160,4
76161,"Great volume, loads of ruffles.",76161,4
76161,Comfortable on baby and very pretty.,76161,4
76162,"Beautiful jacket, fits a bit snug for its size, especially in the bust area.",76162,4
76162,It's very crisp and makes a lot of noise which I find extremely annoying but my husband assures me leather does that for a while.,76162,4
76162,We are going to try mink oil and see if that helps.,76162,4
76162,"Additionally, it SMELLS - so it has hung in the garage in order to descent.",76162,4
76162,"Wore it on the motorcycle yesterday, significant improvement in odor emissions.",76162,4
76162,Hope another week in the garage helps so it can go in the closet.,76162,4
76162,"Fast shipping, decent quality.",76162,4
76163,A little large but my f ault in ordering.,76163,4
76164,"Nice skirt, decent price.",76164,4
76164,Just what we needed for a band concert.,76164,4
76165,Very nice and sexy,76165,4
76166,This was a gift and it was very cute.,76166,4
76167,Somewhat small and I ordered a 2t.,76167,4
76168,Top was too large for size.,76168,4
76168,Material was very thin.,76168,4
76168,Appears to be made well.,76168,4
76169,Having read reviews that it ran small...we ordered a size up.,76169,4
76169,Fit perfectly and will be great.,76169,4
76169,I will have to reinforce buttons a bit but for $19.99 I have no issue with that.,76169,4
76170,I look like the Michelin man!,76170,4
76172,I like it a lot except it is thinner then I expected it to be.,76172,4
76172,But overall it's nice!,76172,4
76174,"This suit is very figure flattering, and while it said to order a size larger, my normal size would have been fine.",76174,4
76174,I can make it work.,76174,4
76174,Thankful I don't have to continue searching.,76174,4
76175,It is a beautiful dress and everything was perfect other than too small and too long but we are taking it to be altered  Shipping and everything else was great.,76175,4
76176,It lost a star because there was a small hole near the dip in the chest area but I sewed it up.,76176,4
76176,Would be wonderful if they included a sheet that showed different ways to wrap it but YouTube worked just fine.,76176,4
76176,"Overall great buy, everyone loved it",76176,4
76177,will be perfect for our Kauai trip,76177,4
76178,Good ..but  i think is dark blue not gray,76178,4
76179,"Yes, so far holding the earrings in place.",76179,4
76179,Since they are $900.,76179,4
76179,"David Truman earrings, it's critical to  confirm I still have them in",76179,4
76180,Nice case ~ would have given 5 stars but the wrist strap is pathetic.,76180,4
76181,"If you are a busty woman, go another size up.",76181,4
76182,"Nice graphics, good fit.",76182,4
76184,"Runs small, or else I need to lose a few.",76184,4
76185,pants are a bit short in length,76185,4
76186,"I like this skeleton dinosaur necklace, and it seems quite sturdy.",76186,4
76186,"It's also fairly large, so if you like dainty necklaces, this is not the one for you.",76186,4
76186,"It is super-cute, though!",76186,4
76187,They are so cute.everyon loves them.. Two of them did come with really small holes and that sucked,76187,4
76188,I have long curly hair and a smaller than average head.,76188,4
76188,I used this to keep my hair out of my eyes while I am working (outside worker).,76188,4
76188,These are thin enough for summers in coastal NC.,76188,4
76188,"Fits perfect, very light so not hot.",76188,4
76188,Just the thing I needed.,76188,4
76188,This is the second one I bought and will buy more.,76188,4
76189,"Pretty,  but very poor packaging.",76189,4
76189,This is a gift.,76189,4
76191,Is nice and a nice color,76191,4
76192,Perfect for warm weather months.,76192,4
76192,Has an adjustable strap to accommodate different size heads.,76192,4
76193,I wish the colors of the letter were red and black instead of red and gray,76193,4
76194,It hangs well and is breathable.,76194,4
76194,"I bought a small (5'5"" and about 125lbs).",76194,4
76194,"It's a little tight going over my hips and I could have probably bought a medium, but once it is on it is comfortable.",76194,4
76194,I went with the small because I didn't want more length added.,76194,4
76194,This hits me just below the knees.,76194,4
76194,I bought it in two colors (charcoal and navy).,76194,4
76194,I found them both to be accurate representations of what was pictured and what I imagined.,76194,4
76195,"The fabric quality was great, but I had to return it.",76195,4
76195,"I'm only 5'1"" so the torso fit much too long.",76195,4
76195,It gapped unflatteringly in the back.,76195,4
76195,Very nice bodysuit if the fit is right for you though.,76195,4
76196,"Fits as expected, no problems yet.",76196,4
76197,"These are super cute and made well enough for the price paid, I wish they had other colors/patterns.",76197,4
76198,It runs way too small,76198,4
76199,The culottes fit well and seemed to be a good value.,76199,4
76201,Good quality of fabric.,76201,4
76202,Good variety of colors and super cheap.,76202,4
76202,"I like them, the stone is pretty small though.",76202,4
76202,So it's not very noticable.,76202,4
76203,I read the reviews before purchasing and purchased two sizes too large as recommended.,76203,4
76203,I found that it was too large.,76203,4
76203,"I think one size up would have sufficed, but since it's a bathing suit, it will work just fine.",76203,4
76203,I was also pleasantly surprised at the material.,76203,4
76203,"I expected it to be cheap, but it looks fairly durable.",76203,4
76203,I haven't swam in it yet so I cannot rate how well it lasts just yet.,76203,4
76204,Well I got a Pepe with my friend just for the heck of it!,76204,4
76204,And it's serving its duty quite well!,76204,4
76204,The paint on this pin was a bit flaky but that's all.,76204,4
76204,It won't come off or anything so no worries:),76204,4
76206,Love that it came in a casing but you do have to clean the badges a bit since they are dusty.,76206,4
76206,The the needle thing is not centered and they spin around easily but totally worth the $15,76206,4
76207,"Daughter was Barf for Halloween, prompt shipping, just as advertised",76207,4
76208,Like the style but size a little to small than expected.,76208,4
76208,Should have ordered one size up!,76208,4
76209,"Ok so this is super cute on your stethoscope but honestly it kind of gets in the way, if i could figure out a way so it would not slide up and down after you get it on...but like I said its very cute and gets lots of compliments",76209,4
76210,"I like Vans, they're easy to slip on and off.",76210,4
76210,Not great for arch support but comfortable and quiet.,76210,4
76211,"I bought 5 pairs of these gloves -- the price for sheepskin is unbeatable, and the style is superbly cute.",76211,4
76211,"Even though they are supposed to be a ""standard"" size, it seems like within the 5 pairs, I got 4 different sizes... one so small that no adult in my family could wear them!",76211,4
76211,Only one pair was big enough for my wide hands -- the rest will go to my ma who wears a slightly smaller size.,76211,4
76211,The odd one will go to charity.,76211,4
76211,"For the record -- I bought 3 pairs of pink, 1 brown, 1 white.",76211,4
76212,"Medium quality, it's pretty thick",76212,4
76213,Just wore the shirt to a gala and it looked fabulous.,76213,4
76213,I do recommend having it pressed prior to wearing and adding some starch to stiffen it a bit.,76213,4
76214,The wood and joints are very nice.,76214,4
76214,Works great on my western work boots except i had to sand the insole WAY down.,76214,4
76214,I wear a size 11,76214,4
76215,was a gift and she loves it.,76215,4
76216,Very stylish but tight in the arms and I don't have large arms.,76216,4
76217,it was a gift.,76217,4
76217,ive seen him wear it,76217,4
76218,"These are cute socks, nice and soft.",76218,4
76218,"If you have a big ankle/lower calf, the top band might be a little tight.",76218,4
76218,"For average legs, this won't be an issue.",76218,4
76219,Fits perfect had a little smell.,76219,4
76220,"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it only has one zipper, and not two.",76220,4
76220,"when you are closing zippers on a backpack, you would normally use two hands and make zippers meet in the middle.",76220,4
76220,"Here it's a pain to close it and I could never reach the end of the other side, so people at Coachella kept stopping me and telling me that my backpack is undone.",76220,4
76220,"Why, Micael Kors, just whyyyy you would not use a little bit of common sense and do it like all other backpacks did it since the beginning of time.",76220,4
76220,"You put two zippers on the bottom pocket, where it's less needed, but on two top ones - one zipper!",76220,4
76220,:))) other then that - great backpack.,76220,4
76221,"I bought to have a thin cardigan for work, and this does the trick.",76221,4
76221,"Pros: Lightweight, flows really nicely (I'm 5'2"" and it hits below the back of my knees), fits snuggly on the top, and it doesn't need the belt to look complete

Cons: Material is thin and not as soft as I'd prefer in a sweater, but it gets the job done.",76221,4
76221,It's also prone to wrinkling and creasing if it's not put up properly.,76221,4
76221,I wouldn't wear this alone if I was trying to keep myself warm.,76221,4
76222,I really like this piece of luggage.,76222,4
76222,"We ordered two and kept them both, even though it is not expandable as advertised.",76222,4
76222,I contacted the seller but never got an answer and for those reasons I give it a four star review.,76222,4
76222,It does not hold as much as our older carry on pieces but at this point we value the light weight and easy pull.,76222,4
76222,"It was very easy to lift these fully loaded cases overhead, as if putting them in the overhead storage, but we decided to check them in.",76222,4
76222,They held up quite well with minimum signs of wear.,76222,4
76223,I really love this.,76223,4
76223,The only problem is that the fabric is so fragile it is getting holes in it really quickly.,76223,4
76223,I am afraid to wash it.,76223,4
76225,First of all I love these pants so much that I bought a second pair in green.,76225,4
76225,They are great fitting cargo pants and the small fits me perfectly.,76225,4
76225,"I'm 5'9"" and normally wear a size 2-4 and a 33"" inseam.",76225,4
76225,They do have a few issues.,76225,4
76225,"When I washed the green pair (cold water, inside out, delicate cycle, hang to dry) the seam across the back yoke frayed.",76225,4
76225,"This is a manufacturing defect, in that the seam wasn't sewn correctly to begin with.",76225,4
76225,"But I washed them when they say to dry clean, so I fixed it myself.",76225,4
76225,Also the green pair had one of the front pockets folded over and sewn into the side seam making the pocket unusable so I fixed that also.,76225,4
76225,"The green pair is slightly larger than the black pair, making them more comfortable.",76225,4
76225,That's the main reason I didn't return the green pair because of the pocket defect.,76225,4
76225,I wasn't sure how the replacement pair would fit.,76225,4
76227,adorable but see through .,76227,4
76227,more of a night gown,76227,4
76228,FAB style and comfortable.... but WAY WAY small.,76228,4
76228,I would say order a full size up,76228,4
76230,This is very nice of a windbreaker!,76230,4
76230,"The color, and design all works perfectly.",76230,4
76230,"For other buyers, you may want to know to buy a size bigger.",76230,4
76230,"I usually wear a large but from other customers' knowledge, I got an X-large and the length works.",76230,4
76230,"I'm not a big fan of the elastic waist because it's super tight and when I put my hands up and down, the jacket goes up and stays up.",76230,4
76230,"I'm probably going to get rid of the elastic, but that's my problem.",76230,4
76230,"Otherwise, buy this product, and remember, a size larger!",76230,4
76231,A little big but I like the loose fit.,76231,4
76232,Does well to protect your skid lid.,76232,4
76232,Didn't manage 5 stars because I'm not convinced they're made nearly as well as they were 30-40 years ago.,76232,4
76233,it was a hit at the party!,76233,4
76233,fit comfortably and was decent quality for the low price.,76233,4
76233,the headband was a little flimsy (super small feather) but that was an easy fix.,76233,4
76233,it was cold the night i wore it and i found it surprisingly warm (that's the polyester).,76233,4
76233,anyways... it was cute and i'm glad it fit true to size.,76233,4
76235,I like but not crazy about,76235,4
76236,"So very comfortable but for my style, not an average day wear item.",76236,4
76236,Great for beach or pool though!,76236,4
76239,"Love, My new favorite!",76239,4
76240,Really cute and VERY comfy-stretchy for those date nights when you want to look sexy but know you are going to eat alot...lol!,76240,4
76241,This is actually quite beautiful.,76241,4
76241,These are horribly expensive elsewhere.,76241,4
76241,I got 2 Im thinking of getting more.,76241,4
76242,I bought this skirt because I simply fell in love with the pattern and I still love it very much!,76242,4
76242,"The material isn't what I expected, but after getting used to the light weight, I found myself liking it.",76242,4
76242,It's very nice for the eighty degree weather.,76242,4
76242,The only thing that didn't please me too much were the shorts that were attached.,76242,4
76242,"The idea was nice, but the shorts were pretty see-through and the material caused the skirt to stick to it.",76242,4
76242,I was able to fix this by taking the time to cut the shorts out and use my own cotton shorts underneath.,76242,4
76242,The skirt seemed to cooperate a lot more after that.,76242,4
76242,"It's still a bit susceptible to static cling, but I have yet to have too much of a problem with it.",76242,4
76242,"Overall, a nice skirt.",76242,4
76242,It just takes some messing with to make it work.,76242,4
76243,i  would love it if the leggings wouldn't roll down when they're on!!!!!,76243,4
76243,PLEASE ANYBODY HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS?!?,76243,4
76243,it's no good to buy slimming leggings when they ROLL DOWN!,76243,4
76244,I ordered a size 8 and received a size 12.,76244,4
76244,I couldn't tell how the dress fits.,76244,4
76244,I just returned the dress.,76244,4
76245,"fit nice , I wore these to exhaustion , they are really nice  , I got a eduim I'm 5'6 beware they say XC not XO",76245,4
76246,Had adhesive on the cabachon that made dull spots and had to be scraped off.,76246,4
76246,Also has a weird light spot in the picture that looks like a flaw but i see it in other peoples review photos so it just is there.,76246,4
76246,"It looks like light shining on the cabachon in photos, but its a streak of lighter patch on the picture.",76246,4
76246,Chain and findings appear ok.,76246,4
76246,Even with the light spot it is pretty.,76246,4
76246,Bought this for a little one but want one for me too....,76246,4
76247,"5ft8,160 lbs, so I got a small.",76247,4
76247,I originally tried an Xtra small and it was too tight around chest and waist although the sleeve length was okay.,76247,4
76247,A quality product if you can get the size right.,76247,4
76247,But amazon will accept returns.,76247,4
76247,Like I said the small fit me even with a liner which this does not come with.,76247,4
76247,Must be purchased separately.,76247,4
76249,"I looked everywhere for  a feminine, lace trimmed robe.",76249,4
76249,"And then I found this, which is exactly what I wanted!",76249,4
76249,"The fabric is a bit thinner than I expected, but it is a beautiful robe.",76249,4
76250,So excited to get this!,76250,4
76250,I bought two sizes (can't be too careful): size small and size medium.,76250,4
76250,"I'm almost always size small, but the medium fits me better.",76250,4
76250,"I'm 5'1"", 115 pounds with a booty.",76250,4
76250,The pics are of the medium on me and it fits ok.,76250,4
76250,"I might wear a plain black bottom with more coverage when I'm around family, but overall, this suit is cute!!",76250,4
76250,Size up if you got a booty and/or a large bust.,76250,4
76250,"My bra size isn't very big (b cup), and the girls were spilling out the sides of the size small.",76250,4
76250,"If you're unsure, buy two sizes and return the ill fitting one (I use Prime, so it's no issue for me).",76250,4
76254,"Fit as expected, and the ties on the sides can be adjusted to fit better.",76254,4
76255,Im very small waisted so of course its just a bit loose.,76255,4
76255,Great to walk in.,76255,4
76255,if I ran hey would probably get too stretchy and I would feel like they are coming off.,76255,4
76255,"material is nice, colors are bright just like the picture.",76255,4
76255,It is very stretch but you feel just a tad of compression.,76255,4
76256,I have this dress in blue and red.,76256,4
76256,"They are both cut the same, a flattering cut for a post-partum body, but the fabric on the red is much better because it has a little more weight to it in order to hide all those bumps in your midsection that you are still trying to get rid of.",76256,4
76258,This was a gift for my teenage daughter and she loves it.,76258,4
76258,We had the hardest time getting her to take it off.,76258,4
76258,My only complaints is when she first wore it that everything was black.,76258,4
76258,"The outfit under the sweater her arms, her neck etc.",76258,4
76258,So after 3 washes it was fine.,76258,4
76259,"Nice and comfortable, easy to care for.",76259,4
76260,Just be careful it doesn't slide out of your pocket since it's all metal.,76260,4
76262,I have small feet with high arches.,76262,4
76262,It took a while for me to brake in these clogs.,76262,4
76262,They where very tight on my arches .,76262,4
76262,Next time I will order up a size.,76262,4
76263,These are really cute socks and nice fabric but my 6 month old has big feet and they're already too small for him!,76263,4
76263,I even tried to get a size larger (6-12 months) but they keep slouching down his feet.,76263,4
76263,They're comfy for now but won't be on him for long,76263,4
76264,I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the smell.,76264,4
76264,"I sprayed febreeze hoping that would help and let it air out over night, but it still smells.",76264,4
76264,"HOWEVER, the color is perfect, I love all the room in it and it is simply a great value!",76264,4
76265,Brought as a PJ,76265,4
76266,"It's a really cute dress, but I though it would be brown.",76266,4
76266,It's actually more of an olive gree.,76266,4
76267,"I Really love the shirt, but for me the 1x was a little bigger then expected.",76267,4
76267,"Also the material is thick for colder weather, but that also makes the shirt feel heavy too.",76267,4
76269,I bought this product before christmas last year and it was perfect.,76269,4
76269,You can wash it in the washing machine and know that it will not fade or damage it.,76269,4
76269,You can wear your hair up in it even in a ponytail or you can leave it down both ways it works and looks amazing.,76269,4
76269,It will keep your ears and head very warm in the winter.,76269,4
76269,The material is very thick.,76269,4
76269,Overall i am pretty satisfied with this product.,76269,4
76270,These are really beautiful!!,76270,4
76270,They are of good size and the pins work well.,76270,4
76270,They look beautiful on just about anything you put them on!,76270,4
76271,"Men's fit good, but women's was a little small.",76271,4
76271,"The pink is tarnishing a bit, but still nice.",76271,4
76272,This swimsuit is well made and is a great value for the price.,76272,4
76272,I normal wear a women's 18/20 or 38D.,76272,4
76272,I purchased the XXXL because of reviews and the description.,76272,4
76272,The suit fits mostly well.,76272,4
76272,"Just like another reviewer said, the cups fit like a sculpted bra, in other words when you take off the top, the cups stay in exactly the same shape.",76272,4
76272,"I found the cups to be slightly too big for my 38D's, but purchased sew-in gel inserts from a fabric store to help push me up to fill the gaps in the top.",76272,4
76272,"I found the bottoms to be a touch snug, but I can deal with that...at least they won't get pulled off in the waves.",76272,4
76272,The front coverage on the bottoms is great.,76272,4
76273,The triangle in the back was black which I wasn't happy about when the picture clearly shows tan...but that's the only thing I noticed I didn't like...received within a couple days...,76273,4
76274,It's cute and wonderful.,76274,4
76274,The time changer knob on the bottom fell off about a month in.,76274,4
76274,So it is not practical for keeping time but it is still freaking cute.,76274,4
76275,They fit as expected.,76275,4
76276,It's fine - it works - No problems,76276,4
76277,Started carrying this bag as soon as I got it.,76277,4
76277,Love all the compartments..especially the 2 little side pockets.,76277,4
76277,Keep my cell phone in the zippered one.,76277,4
76278,Just wanted to leave this review if anyone needs advice on a size.,76278,4
76278,"I am 5'7"" and roughly 155-160 lbs, 31-inch waist typically wear size M, 8/29 in jeans.",76278,4
76278,"I got the M corset and it fits true to size, very slimming, And actually comfortable.",76278,4
76278,It's a good starting point if you're interested in getting into waist training.,76278,4
76278,"If you want the really right feel, I would go with a S!",76278,4
76278,"If you want to be safe, go with an M. Overall very pleased with this corset, you wouldn't think it is, but it's very comfortable!",76278,4
76279,I bought two different colors/styles and I like them both.,76279,4
76279,"They are cute, fit well and the material is really soft.",76279,4
76279,Both styles I purchased were one size fits all.,76279,4
76279,The one thing I will mention is that the removable pads are just circles!,76279,4
76279,No natural breast shape to them at all.,76279,4
76279,They look kind of funny and are quite obvious if you are just wearing the bra.,76279,4
76279,They look fine underneath a shirt though.,76279,4
76280,"I love the dress however, took it out of the package and it fit perfectly but then I put it in the dryer, just to get the wrinkles out and the dress shrunk!!!",76280,4
76281,fits pretty good still a bit small.,76281,4
76281,im a medium but ordered a xl cause i know these are in asian signs,76281,4
76282,It's pretty but cheaply made.,76282,4
76282,Then again it was so cheap to buy!,76282,4
76283,The tops of these tend to roll up and look weird but they are long enough for my long legs so...I'm 5'11 and expected them to barely hit my knees but they do come above the knee.,76283,4
76283,Wish they had a better seam at the top.,76283,4
76285,Beautiful clutch but too heavy so I returned it.,76285,4
76285,Just didn't feel comfortable to carry.,76285,4
76286,I like the versatility that this item gives you.,76286,4
76286,Great organization and you are not left digging in your purse or bag for your keys or phone.,76286,4
76286,Just use the handles to pull out of your purse for a quick change.,76286,4
76286,Great for someone that changes their purse to match their outfit.,76286,4
76286,Numerous pockets for all of your items.,76286,4
76286,With a large center pocket that will fit your Kindle or iPad.,76286,4
76286,I would not recommend this item to be used alone.,76286,4
76286,But a great organizer to fit into a larger bag.,76286,4
76288,They were a little long but very comfortable,76288,4
76289,"It fits me okay, but I have a small head so most hats are a little big on me unless they're adjustable.",76289,4
76289,I bought this one because it looks like it's straight out of An American Tail and just like Fievel it slips over my ears.,76289,4
76290,"I'd give it a 5, but the stripy green ones are definitely not as advertised in the set I got.",76290,4
76290,"The amythst ones are definitely better quality others I've gotten in the past, which were too dark.",76290,4
76290,"Also not so much a fault of the seller, but I would have ordered the 16mm if they had been there when I saved the entry to my list, these fit, but I would have gladly gone up a size if I had realized.",76290,4
76292,This was a gift that my daughter asked for.,76292,4
76292,She was very surprised at the amount that was in the package.,76292,4
76292,She thought for the price it would be one or two pair.,76292,4
76293,Wayyyyyyyyy too big around the bust and overall really.,76293,4
76293,Def consider going a size or two down.,76293,4
76294,purchased as a gift-fit as expected,76294,4
76295,I'm 5'9 and it hits at the top of my foot.,76295,4
76295,I won't be able to wear any heels with it but I still like it.,76295,4
76297,"Good quality, I wear it daily.",76297,4
76298,Loved them but they were too small for my glasses and had to return,76298,4
76299,Thought it was a stretchy belt.,76299,4
76299,But besides that nice quality and is exactly as shows and maybe even better when you see it for yourself.,76299,4
76299,Really cute belt ;),76299,4
76301,"It's very cute, but it smells bad.",76301,4
76302,back zipper seems to rub on back of ankle every once in awhile but other than that LOVE em!,76302,4
76303,I love this cape very beautiful I gave it 4 stars only because it's very sensitive my nails are medium length and I almost snagged a hole.,76303,4
76303,I looks great on warm and comfortable.,76303,4
76304,Necklace looks heavy in the picture but it is light.,76304,4
76305,This swim diaper is a little big.,76305,4
76305,It is difficult to put underneath a swimsuit.,76305,4
76305,Too bad they don't have a top to match!,76305,4
76305,Other than that it is very cute and the buttons on the side make it much easier to take off of a wet toddler!,76305,4
76306,Read some reviews and ordered a half size bigger than my usual size.,76306,4
76306,They fit really well and look super cute!,76306,4
76306,For the price they are pretty decent.,76306,4
76306,"No they are not your super pricey boot, so they probably won't last forever, but I have worn them three times and they are relatively compfortable and still look good as new.",76306,4
76307,Second purchase of these pants.,76307,4
76308,Holy hell are these things a pain to get on!,76308,4
76308,I've traveled now a few times so I have gotten the hang of it but they are TIGHT and you should really sit down for the first few inches otherwise you'll tip right over.,76308,4
76308,You have to wear something over them.,76308,4
76308,"I tried my regular leggings over them and it just looked weird, but they work under jeans or sweats.",76308,4
76309,Perfect fit and soft material!,76309,4
76310,The dress is beautiful but it's a little tight on my boobs.,76310,4
76310,"Also the skirt is all see through so there's a skirt underneath but it is really, really short.",76310,4
76310,Other than that I love it and how it feels.,76310,4
76311,Fits great and is super cute!,76311,4
76312,it's black and it's underwear.,76312,4
76312,My husband is happy.,76312,4
76313,They fit and I am not worried about loosing them!,76313,4
76315,"Warm, soft, not itchy at all.",76315,4
76315,The only thing I wish I could change is that it poofs out more than I would like.,76315,4
76316,Cute it is short would of liked the ties to be a little thicker but no big deal still nice and for the price even better  wearing large,76316,4
76317,Received my order today and I am very happy with it.,76317,4
76317,"The material is great, very soft lace.",76317,4
76317,Fits loose and pretty long.,76317,4
76317,The pattern is not the same as pictures and that is why I am giving this item 4 stars.,76317,4
76317,Still very nice and definitely recommend this as a beautiful beach cover up,76317,4
76319,I almost didn't buy these because of the negative reviews but they were cheap enough anyway.,76319,4
76319,"So I ordered one pair first, which I still have after I purchased just a few months ago, they now have a tiny hole in one seam but still wearable you can't see it yet and I wear them constantly and wash them just as much and they are extremely comfortable.",76319,4
76319,"I purchased a second pair because I loved these so much, unfortunately I threw that pair away already because it got a tear all down a whole seam within about a month after purchasing and I didn't even wear it but a few times cause I wear the first pair a lot more still.",76319,4
76319,"So, the second pair was a dud but still have my first pair so I guess you just just take a chance on what quality they send you.",76319,4
76319,I would purchase another because they are super comfy but I don't expect them to last any more than a few months.,76319,4
76320,"I'm usually a Medium, but this was somewhat large.",76320,4
76320,I think the small would've been perfect,76320,4
76321,Great but Large is too small.,76321,4
76321,man's size needs XL.,76321,4
76322,The skirt fits my wife as expected but the shirt not so much... in the picture it shows mid abdominal area but when she got it its right below her breast and it's not causeasy of the chest size... and the black trim around the collar area fits more like a choker then how it seems to fit as seen in the picture... so she made it a V neck...,76322,4
76323,Really cute but is kind of long but not long enough to be a slouchy beanie but other than that I really like it.,76323,4
76323,Keeps your head super warm and its really comfy to wear.,76323,4
76324,The status still says shipping but I got them a few weeks ago.,76324,4
76324,So the early arrival is GREAT.,76324,4
76324,They're real cute for the price I paid.,76324,4
76325,"nice basic top, it fits a bit large as it is supposed to, I wish I would have sized down but I am happy with it and would buy again.",76325,4
76326,"The color is not as yellow as I thought it would be, the material is pretty thin.",76326,4
76326,"But I like it in general, it's very stretchy.",76326,4
76327,"It's true to size, and very nice.",76327,4
76328,I'm a small B cup.,76328,4
76328,This would definitely look better on a bustier gal but i was ambitious.,76328,4
76328,I still love the fit.,76328,4
76328,It's gonna go good with some pasties.,76328,4
76329,"Really love this wallet just the right size and awesome color the only problem I can see are the zippers, they get stuck and hard to close afraid I will break them if I use too much force.",76329,4
76330,"I expected these to be long and will have to shorten them, but the fabric is really nice.",76330,4
76330,"I'm 5'8""--These would fit someone 6' or over.",76330,4
76330,Will probably buy another color.,76330,4
76331,"I love this crop top, because it looks classy not trashy.",76331,4
76331,I bought one size up.,76331,4
76331,"I'm glad I did,  because it shrank a little.",76331,4
76331,I wish they offered more colors besides just white.,76331,4
76332,They're good for the gym & that's why I purchased them.,76332,4
76332,They are lightweight and easy to exercise in and not feel weighted down;,76332,4
76333,These are nice pants.,76333,4
76333,They're comfortable and arrived earlier than expected.,76333,4
76333,"Problem is, they sent me a size large (us size 8) and I ordered a size small (us size 4).",76333,4
76333,So Wearing them requires a belt.,76333,4
76333,Otherwise they're nice pants.,76333,4
76334,It came in like 2days.. Looks just like pic ..,76334,4
76334,I'm a size 36c small/medium top and a large bottom size 8 .. (Big butt) I got an x large based off reviews it fits a lil loose but I like it that way I don't have any love handle or muffin too sticking out..,76334,4
76334,The top is lose around the band but yet it's short like if I pick up my arms I think my boobs will show out the bottom..,76334,4
76334,It's fixable I still really like it,76334,4
76335,Just got the bag.,76335,4
76335,"It' not black as the photo, which is disappointing.",76335,4
76335,It's a fair amount lighter and I would not even call it charcoal.,76335,4
76335,It's ok though and good quality.,76335,4
76336,Expected fleece material NOT FLEECE just a heads up,76336,4
76337,Love this bathing suit !,76337,4
76337,"I don't have the ""perfect figure"" but this sure made me feel as tho I did !",76337,4
76337,For the ladies who have a little extra to hide I fully recommend !,76337,4
76337,"Ordered my regular size, medium.",76337,4
76337,"I'm 5""3 160 pounds",76337,4
76341,"Pretty but, they look larger on models ear.",76341,4
76342,"I am not a skirt/dress wearing kinda girl, but there are certain times and situations where they are required.",76342,4
76342,I am all about comfort and this is one of the most comfortable skirts I've ever worn.,76342,4
76342,"Unfortunately mine came to me with a hole in the seam, but I stitched it up and its good as new.",76342,4
76343,This is a nice watchband for the price.,76343,4
76343,"It came with plenty of extra pins, was easy to adjust the size and is comfortable.",76343,4
76343,It looks good too.,76343,4
76343,The only issue I have is that it doesn't quite look robust enough on the Pebble Time Steel.,76343,4
76343,It's pretty thin whereas the Steel is rather thick.,76343,4
76343,But I like it.,76343,4
76344,"I liked the suit, but didn't love it.",76344,4
76344,"Bought it last minute, was going to Phoenix and needed a swim suit.",76344,4
76344,"But, never had the time to use it.",76344,4
76344,"Will be returning it, only because it was a last minute purchase.",76344,4
76344,"Its a flattering suit, just wasn't me.",76344,4
76345,"Not overly fancy, yet so functional.",76345,4
76346,Fair quality at fair price.,76346,4
76346,But they do run very small.,76346,4
76346,But ordered an XL.,76346,4
76346,"""Didn't want to show every freckle""",76346,4
76347,I am a US size 4/6 in jeans but tend to need to go larger in dresses.,76347,4
76347,I ordered a size M according to the sizing chart and unfortunately I couldn't zip the back.,76347,4
76347,"I was surprised to see that the back went a little higher than expected, which is good, it's extremely flattering!",76347,4
76347,The color is definitely a true red and the quality is exceptionally well for the price.,76347,4
76347,I am exchanging this for a Large and hopefully can post a photo.,76347,4
76347,"One thing to note - there is zero support in the bust area and the fabric is sheer, and also drapes as low as the photo shows.",76347,4
76347,"Because of how the back falls, you cannot wear a bra either.",76347,4
76347,Definitely would need to get some of those nipple stick ons!,76347,4
76348,The chest/waist fit great (I'm a 38H) but the length is crazy!,76348,4
76348,"I have to hem off a good 5-6 inches, so be aware it's a really really long costume if you order.",76348,4
76348,"I'm 5'0"" and I ordered a Large.",76348,4
76349,Good belt.just as described,76349,4
76350,May look ok from 100 yds away or in the dark.,76350,4
76350,":-/

Update: after my initial disappointment after opening the package I washed and then tried on this cardigan.",76350,4
76350,I felt like I needed to update my review.,76350,4
76350,"It's thin, but I also paid >$20 for it.",76350,4
76350,And it's actually comfy.,76350,4
76350,It's the thickness of a t-shirt.,76350,4
76350,And is flattering on my post baby bod.,76350,4
76350,And that too could be the reason I jumped to such a bad review.,76350,4
76352,Very big - have to have a big wrist for this!,76352,4
76352,Bought it for my daughter in law - too big for her,76352,4
76355,Nice I like it.,76355,4
76357,Shoulders didn't always stay up.,76357,4
76357,"Other than that, it was a great shirt.",76357,4
76358,I had to have the straps taken up and it fit pretty well.,76358,4
76358,I needed a tea length dress so I had it hemmed and it looks great.,76358,4
76359,A little bigger then I thought but very nice.,76359,4
76360,color leans more toward grayish blue as opposed to clear blue.,76360,4
76361,I love these earrings.,76361,4
76361,They look so nice and was happy that I ordered them,76361,4
76363,But it does fit smaller than expected.,76363,4
76364,"It looks like many other bracelets, but it gets a turquoise look across.",76364,4
76364,Perfect for the price,76364,4
76365,"Came earlier than expected thin material tge longer you wear it , it stretches out so I'd go one size smaller than normal",76365,4
76366,this was a gift I bought big thank goodness I bought Larger ** it does not stretch ladies **,76366,4
76367,"This top was a little big on me, but it still looks super cute with a pair of jeans, an army jacket, and a pair of simple heels!",76367,4
76368,I wouldn't say this is a large satchel.,76368,4
76368,It's more medium size.,76368,4
76368,"But it's perfect for my makeup bag, wallet, and a few other things.",76368,4
76368,I do like the design.,76368,4
76368,I would purchase this again for a gift.,76368,4
76369,I'm only marking off a star due to the smell.,76369,4
76369,"This dress was well packaged, but it have a VERY strong chemical scent.",76369,4
76369,I hung it up to air it out before washing.,76369,4
76370,"First off: I've purchased two orders of these, the set of 4, and the set of 5, a week later.",76370,4
76370,In size large and extra large respectively.,76370,4
76370,I very much like the fabric and the fit of the cups for both sizes.,76370,4
76370,The band's under the busy however run small and can be too tight depending on your preferences.,76370,4
76370,"About Me: (In relation to product, size, reason for purchase, etc) I am 21 years old, 5'2"", and weigh 143lbs.",76370,4
76370,"The circumference of my underbust is 33inches, therefore my bra size could be a 36/38/B/C depending on the bra of course.",76370,4
76370,"I have recently gained about 35lbs due to health issues and will be starting physical therapy next month, hence my need for sports bras.",76370,4
76370,I prefer that they zip in the front because they are easier to get on and off.,76370,4
76370,"I needed something that was comfortable, yet supportive, because with my weight gain I have gone from an A Cup to a C Cup roughly.",76370,4
76370,"My Experience: These bras come individually packed in custom zipper bags (see photos posted by other reviewers) however do not have any tags to indicate a ""new item"", like many of us are used to seeing.",76370,4
76370,"Don't let that deter you from buying the bras, they arrived spotless, free of wrinkles, and very much brand new.",76370,4
76370,"I initially purchased the 4 pack, size Large, using the size chart available.",76370,4
76370,"But when I tried them on I had a difficult time zipping them due to a ""lack of slack"" and they were too tight around my under bust to be comfortable despite being very supportive and conformingly comfortable in the cups (once successfully zipped).",76370,4
76370,"I kept them because I know once I'm able to exercise again I will lose an inch or two here and there and the size Large will be snug enough to provide control over my ""girls"" while running and HIIT type of exercise.",76370,4
76370,"Moving on, I then purchased the 5 pack, in Size Extra Large, to use for now and then later as an every day/yoga/ lazy day bra.",76370,4
76370,"The extra large are easier to zip than the large for me, they provided the right amount of ""extra slack"" needed.",76370,4
76370,"However, they are still slightly too tight under my bust to be comfortably worn all day.",76370,4
76370,"For an hour of exercise though, they do the trick.",76370,4
76370,Other Factors: The quality and colors are amazing.,76370,4
76370,"I have washed both sets and they did not run, the colors are vibrant, and the foam cup inserts actually match the color of the bra which was a nice surprise when I discovered that.",76370,4
76370,"I am very happy with the quality and the little extra touches like the matching cups, and even the fabric zipper covers on both ends.",76370,4
76370,"The price is where it's at, I purchased 9 zipper closure sports bras that are FLATTERING AND SUPPORTING for under $60 and received them in two days with prime shipping.",76370,4
76370,"9 awesome bras, for the price of one seemingly overpriced Victorias Secret sports bra with the same zipper closure.",76370,4
76370,Why Not 5 Stars?,76370,4
76370,: The sizing is a tad frustrating.,76370,4
76370,"These are made in China and I do believe they are more of ""Asian"" sizes than ""U.S."" or ""European"".",76370,4
76370,I mean no disrespect.,76370,4
76370,Only that Asians are more naturally petite so these bras absolutely do run small.,76370,4
76370,"Not so much a cup size problem, as they are stretchy and hug your curves accordingly, but the circumference of the band in relation to the size of an average woman's under bust measurement is off, and runs tight.",76370,4
76370,"But as I said in the beginning, it's all about personal preference.",76370,4
76370,"I love these bras, I only wish they came in an XXL, then they would be a perfect 5 star product.",76370,4
76371,"Color was exactly as expected, quality appears good.",76371,4
76371,Size was a bit too small but I blame that on my belly.,76371,4
76371,If you are larger through the midsection than you are in the chest order a size or two larger.,76371,4
76372,"Could be better, but still funny :-)",76372,4
76373,"It is a bit cheap material wise, but it is cute.",76373,4
76373,the top is a little shorter than shown in the picture but over all I like it.,76373,4
76373,It also came a day early so that's a plus.,76373,4
76373,"Bought it to surprise my hubby for valentines day, it'll get the job done.",76373,4
76374,Runs a size large.,76374,4
76374,I am 5'3 and it hits right at the knees.,76374,4
76374,Basic t shirt dress not much shape to it.,76374,4
76374,The crimson is definitely crimson not a bright red as shown.,76374,4
76375,Boog a large;  fits more like a medium.,76375,4
76376,I did really like this dress... it just didn't work for me.,76376,4
76376,"The bodice was a lot shorter than I would have liked... almost empire, but a little longer?",76376,4
76376,"It was just awkward on me, and it only accentuated my mom belly.",76376,4
76376,"That said, the embellishment was gorgeous.",76376,4
76376,"It was definitely long (I'm only 5'3"") but it wasn't anything that couldn't have been hemmed.",76376,4
76377,"Fun, easy way to get into the sock game.",76377,4
76377,Not sure how long they will last but we'll see.,76377,4
76377,Overall pleased so far.,76377,4
76378,Cute top and got a lot of compliments,76378,4
76380,The dress looked great except it was too short.,76380,4
76380,I'm only 5'7 but the dress floated above my ankles and not like it shows in the picture to the floor.,76380,4
76380,I was luck it was a beach wedding and I could wear flats.,76380,4
76382,"I wear  38"" Levis.",76382,4
76382,"I ordered a 36"" belt.",76382,4
76382,"It is 4"" to6"" smaller than I should have ordered.",76382,4
76382,It's a pretty good belt and it's worth what I paid for it.,76382,4
76382,"I should have ordered a belt that was 2"" to 4"" larger than the waist size of my Levis.",76382,4
76383,"Cute and fun,  I  love the two swirling and the infinity, the  bands  were a bit  cheaper, but  to me  for the  others it was  worth it.",76383,4
76385,The colors are vibrant.,76385,4
76385,It's very eye catching.,76385,4
76385,Stands out well with a black blouse.,76385,4
76386,My 12 year old son loves this bracelet.,76386,4
76386,He wears it daily and it's holding up really well.,76386,4
76386,"The rubber bands that came with it were a mystery at first, but after a few days he realiased they are good for wrapping up the loose strings.",76386,4
76386,"We had to buy some tiny black rubber bands, though, because the neon colors they sent weren't to his taste.",76386,4
76387,It's to small around the neck it shokes my daughter,76387,4
76388,I was very pleasantly surprised by how well these fit.,76388,4
76388,They are very comfortable and I have a feeling they will be my new favorite leggings.,76388,4
76388,I'm 5'7 and weigh roughly 165 ish.,76388,4
76388,"I'm not a big girl, but I do carry a little bit of weight in my stomach after having 4 kids.",76388,4
76388,Nothing a pair of spanx can't take care of.,76388,4
76388,"Speaking of spanx, the reason I searched for compression leggings is to help hold in and give my stomach support.",76388,4
76388,Spanx tend to cinch too tight in the rib cage area leaving me breathless (and not in a good way ;)).,76388,4
76388,I wanted leggings that sucked me in but were comfortable.,76388,4
76388,"These tights are fantastically comfortable, with a little bit of compression.",76388,4
76388,"These leggings don't quite pull me in like I had hoped, but they do smooth everything out.",76388,4
76388,I feel nice and secure in them.,76388,4
76388,For those of you that are looking for leggings to wear with shorter shirts.,76388,4
76388,These are not them.,76388,4
76388,These will be perfect under a tunic or dress.,76388,4
76388,"They don't look shear on the legs, but as I lifted up my shirt in the bathroom to see if I could see through them, I could in fact see through them.",76388,4
76388,"That's not a big deal to me as I don't wear shorter shirts with leggings, but I know that does matter to some.",76388,4
76389,For the price this is a very cute kimono.,76389,4
76390,The wallet was an extra bonus!,76390,4
76390,"With that said,  it is bigger than I thought.",76390,4
76390,No divider pockets other than a few small open pockets and one zipper pocket.,76390,4
76390,I have been trying to keep my purses smaller and crossbody due to back problems.,76390,4
76390,Choices are so limited with concealed weapon choices.,76390,4
76390,Overall a nice purse.,76390,4
76391,"like the dress, but need pencil body type to fix china sizing  order at least 2 sizes up for true fit",76391,4
76392,"I ordered the size 6, and I typically can wear a size 4 - 6.",76392,4
76392,"The colour of this two piece is a lovely dark blue, although it doesn't appear as dark as the photos.",76392,4
76392,"The fit is athletic, and the back straps provide great support without pinching.",76392,4
76392,"Despite this, the top may not do if you have a full bust.",76392,4
76392,"The swim bottom provides full coverage but seems somewhat small, fits tight, and hits at an odd place.",76392,4
76392,"Nonetheless, it doesn't feel as if you'll be exposed while you walk or bend over.",76392,4
76392,"Note: there is a pleasant surprise, something not seen in the photo-- a greenish-teal and blue waist band-- very pretty!",76392,4
76392,"It would have been nice to have a little teal somewhere on the top, perhaps on the straps.",76392,4
76392,"Overall I like the two piece, it serves its lap, and fitness purpose and I'm keeping it.",76392,4
76392,"Although it'll probably need replacing due to fading from the chlorine after about 2 1/2 months of wear, once a week for 2.5 hours.",76392,4
76392,I hope this review helps!,76392,4
76393,It fits everywhere but in the bust.,76393,4
76393,"I have to get it tailored to take it quite a bit on the top, but otherwise it was just what I was hoping for.",76393,4
76393,I can't wait to get it tailored and wear it for our special day on the 13th.,76393,4
76394,"The back of the pants for the seat are really small, too much of booty pants not a good fit.",76394,4
76394,Other Southport jeans fit better.,76394,4
76395,I liked the product and it arrived just in time,76395,4
76397,Not the best quality but cute,76397,4
76398,5'2 34ddd fits well to me,76398,4
76399,Very flattering to larger frame,76399,4
76400,"I am 5'2"", 100 lbs., wear a 32B bra, and usually wear a size 2.",76400,4
76400,"I ordered a standard small ""S"", and it fits somewhat too snug across the torso.",76400,4
76400,"I'd like to exchange it for a larger size; however, standard medium in black is sold out.",76400,4
76400,"The fabric is light, somewhat stretchy, and thick enough to not be transparent.",76400,4
76400,It is a mini length dress on me and goes very well with leggings.,76400,4
76400,"Update: Since the US small in black was a little snug, I ordered a US medium in wine.",76400,4
76400,"It is only a slightly larger than the small; however, I can comfortably fit a t-shirt under it.",76400,4
76401,"Sturdy and roomy, and the vinyl or plastic that it's made of is pretty thick.",76401,4
76401,"Even though there is a zipper so that side isn't waterproof, I think if a liquid leaked inside the bag it would have a hard time getting out.",76401,4
76401,"Although it is definitely bigger/deeper than a quart-size plastic bag, security at San Francisco airport and the small regional airport I flew back from did not bat an eyelash at it.",76401,4
76401,Minus 1 star because it is way overpriced for what you're getting.,76401,4
76401,"The main thing you're paying for is extra room if you want to pack more liquid items than you can squeeze into the standard quart bag, plus it's tougher than a Ziploc.",76401,4
76402,not my favorite but looks good when you put it on.,76402,4
76403,"The skirt is lovely, the material is soft, and hits right at the knee.",76403,4
76403,It's too casual for Christmas at church but it's great for regular days ideally summer.,76403,4
76403,"Be careful wearing this skirt around wind, it will pick up.",76403,4
76403,The color is a regular red.,76403,4
76403,I will be ordering others for around summer time.,76403,4
76403,I ordered a large as I'm a 12 in skirts and I'm 5'7.,76403,4
76404,"Nice, small to mdm, business casual purse.",76404,4
76405,The shirt is at least equal in quality to those priced $40 or $50 higher.,76405,4
76405,"The regular fit is a bit wide in the body but fitting perfectly at the shoulders and neck, while the trim fit is too tight across the chest.",76405,4
76405,I'm very satisfied and l don't think you can do better for the price.,76405,4
76407,"Somewhat low quality, the bottoms fray EXTREMELY easily",76407,4
76408,"A few frayed strings coming from seams, but otherwise ok.",76408,4
76409,Super cute 50's style.,76409,4
76409,They seem long until you put it on.,76409,4
76409,I was asked if they are a thong.,76409,4
76409,"No, they have full coverage on the bum.",76409,4
76410,"The spider is much bigger than the picture indicates, so I probably will only wear it for fun at Halloween, nit all year around,  but it's fun and cute.",76410,4
76411,"It does the job, mainly bought becasue my keys were tearing holes in my pocket.",76411,4
76411,This solves that problem.,76411,4
76411,It did take over a month to come though.,76411,4
76411,Turns out that it came directly from China.,76411,4
76411,"Surprisingly well belt, especially considering that it did come from China.",76411,4
76411,I'm very satisfies with it.,76411,4
76412,Not bad the tunnels are a bit cheap feeling but you do get what you pay for.,76412,4
76413,"Good comfy , my daughter loves them !",76413,4
76414,"I'm a 5'6"" female, and buy the men's XS.",76414,4
76414,"This is my favorite everyday workout shirt: it is baggy and non-form fitting, which is exactly what I want.",76414,4
76414,"Men's and women's shirts have similar measurements, except for length, where men's shirts average 1.5-2 inches longer.",76414,4
76414,This provides more coverage when lifting.,76414,4
76414,These also cost much less than comparable women's shirts.,76414,4
76414,"For everyday training, these are more than adequate.",76414,4
76414,I have two and look forward to purchasing more.,76414,4
76415,"My daughter wears a US juniors size 15, bra sz 34C.",76415,4
76415,This suit fits her great.,76415,4
76416,I liked the way it fit.,76416,4
76416,I just had lost woeful by the time I got it.,76416,4
76418,Thin material but the size was just as I expected.,76418,4
76419,Somewhat tight for 75yr old with comfortable body.,76419,4
76420,"i got them for my twins to sleep in , in the summertime.",76420,4
76420,they were about 22 month old.,76420,4
76420,i bought the 24mos.,76420,4
76420,they still have tons of room to grow.,76420,4
76420,they  might be able to wear these for the next year!,76420,4
76422,I bought this and another outfit for my 16 month old.,76422,4
76422,I thought it was beautiful and would have been comfortable for him.,76422,4
76422,Husband thought it was too feminine and vetoed it.,76422,4
76422,I kept it on hand as a backup outfit but we didn't end up using it.,76422,4
76423,I wish that the top had tighter elastic around the bottom.,76423,4
76423,"There was some spillage, and tightening the straps only pulled the back up higher.",76423,4
76423,"Still, this is a great quality swimsuit.",76423,4
76423,"I'm not a huge fan of the Brazilian bottoms out of personal preference, but I like the top so much that I'm keeping it!",76423,4
76424,but not a high quality shoe ( as to be expected for this price) if the shoe is something that you might fall in love with (like I did) I suggest spending another $20 and getting a higher quality shoe,76424,4
76425,"The shoes are great, come with the correct pedals and were very reasonable.",76425,4
76425,"On my first time wearing them, my feet felt flat footed after about 2 hours.",76425,4
76425,I bought some Dr Scholl's inserts and it was like night and day.,76425,4
76425,Longest wear so far is a 4 hour ride and they are comfortable (with inserts) and work great!,76425,4
76427,"this robe was for my mom who is on a feeding tube so we needed something that was button-down, pretty, and warm.",76427,4
76427,This fit the bill perfectly.,76427,4
76427,The neckline was a little big but she wears a shirt underneath anyway so it's great,76427,4
76428,Good quality.. Hook in back takes getting use to.,76428,4
76430,"I love it , but it's see three other then that nothing to complaint",76430,4
76432,fabric gets pulls very easily.,76432,4
76432,"cute, not real thick, but I really like it!",76432,4
76433,Very good product the balls stay on and I love the colors,76433,4

76436,This Dress is made well.,76436,4
76436,It is beautiful but it runs small.,76436,4
76436,I ordered according to size chart and I am not even close to zipping it.,76436,4
76436,I have tried on a ton of formals and am a pretty solid 10 and sometimes 8.,76436,4
76436,I ordered a 10 and I am not even sure if the 12 would fit.,76436,4
76436,"I am 5'6"" and weigh 145 pounds.",76436,4
76437,Pretty good shirt....fabric is decent,76437,4

76438,Very comfy and warm.,76438,4
76439,Fits a little smaller than the other Cole haan shoes I own,76439,4
76440,I ADORE this nightgown!,76440,4
76440,"I'm an average size, maybe a bit more supple woman.",76440,4
76440,"Due to the style, with a halter top, that attaches only to the 'bra area', which is where the free flowing, split back/bottom half is attached..",76440,4
76440,"It is very comfortable, and I feel sexy in it as well!",76440,4
76440,"(only thing I dislike are the freaking  g-strings that this, and almost all lingerie comes with.",76440,4
76440,"I personally don't like dental floss in my rear, and don't any man finds a woman fixing a wedgie is attractive)",76440,4
76441,"Love the suit, but the top was way to small for me.",76441,4
76442,I bought it for a charity run and had a blast!,76442,4
76442,Since I was running I used everything except for the boot covers.,76442,4
76443,It was too small,76443,4
76444,A little too tight even though I go an extra large.,76444,4
76444,I usually where a 10.,76444,4
76445,"Gown is pretty and after washing is nice and soft, and shrinking was minimal.",76445,4
76445,I ordered a size up (medium instead of small) as I'm late in my pregnancy but the elastic around the bust line still seems a bit snug.,76445,4
76445,I'm hoping it will be more comfortable after baby comes.,76445,4
76445,I'm in the fence about ordering another.,76445,4
76446,"This bra works pretty well and easy to use, though the separate pads inside make me a little frustrated.",76446,4
76446,"When you lift it up to breastfeed, the pad gets all bundled up in its pocket and takes some adjustment.",76446,4
76446,"Also, in the wash sometimes the pads go wherever they feel like.",76446,4
76447,Perfect attire for the luau party that I gave my mom for her 80th birthday.,76447,4
76449,I nornally wear smalls but I ordered a medium and it fits like a small.,76449,4
76449,The top is a tad big.,76449,4
76449,Other is gorgeous and its everything I expected.,76449,4
76451,Very cute but I had to return it because the torso was too short.,76451,4
76451,I ordered the correct size for my measurements which was a small.,76451,4
76451,Only problem is is that I'm 6 feet tall with a longer torso so it didn't fit.,76451,4
76451,Otherwise I would have loved the product.,76451,4
76453,"Few days late, but happy with product..",76453,4
76454,These sleepers we very good quality and we're soft and thick (great for NC winters).,76454,4
76454,"However, we ordered these in 18 months and when they were delivered, I realized right away that they are sized more like a 12 months sleepers.",76454,4
76454,"In fact, when I put them next to my son's Carter brand 12 month sleepers, they were the same size.",76454,4
76454,"So, if you're looking for quality sleepers, I definitely recommend these- just consider ordering up a size!",76454,4
76455,"A little tight around my arms than what I hoped, but still a great top!",76455,4
76456,I like my jackets with a little room so I can layer under neath if desired.,76456,4
76456,I'm normally a medium I purchased a large for this reason.,76456,4
76457,Good I like it,76457,4
76458,I ordered two of thees shirts the exact same shirt except one is two sizes smaller.,76458,4
76458,There both marked as the same size on the tag but ones a bit too big and the others a bit too small.,76458,4
76459,Just what was expected!,76459,4
76460,"Top was lovey , however the first time I washed it .",76460,4
76460,"( on a special wash ) ,the colour ran onto the lace ,",76460,4
76461,"While I like these shoes very much, the canvas it is made of is a little stiff when brand new.",76461,4
76461,It does break down and soften with wear so comfort level does increase.,76461,4
76462,a little small - but a great gag gift,76462,4
76464,I am petite (5'2 105 lbs) and ordered the smallest size and it is quite large on me!,76464,4
76464,I wasn't expecting anything skin tight but I was expecting it to fit somewhat like it does in the model picture.,76464,4
76464,"Great shirt, cozy, and cute, just a little larger size wise than expected!",76464,4
76465,I really like the fit of this item.,76465,4
76465,It is stylist and fits perfectly.,76465,4
76465,I ended buying more colors as I loved the look and received lots of compliments.,76465,4
76466,Basic shirt whats not to like?,76466,4
76467,"Got it for my man and he loves it...its his everywhere, everything bag lol",76467,4
76468,Very nice hat but very large.,76468,4
76468,"I had to add ""spacers"" in the lining to get it to fit.",76468,4
76468,Other than that it is a great cap.,76468,4
76470,cute but looks more like a long shirt as it is very short.,76470,4
76470,Would work good as a swim suit cover up.,76470,4
76471,The color is not exactly as pictured.,76471,4
76471,The red is a little dull.,76471,4
76471,Not a vibrant red.,76471,4
76471,But the dress is cute all the same,76471,4
76473,"I bought this for a craft so I'd be taking it apart, that's why I liked it was only $9.",76473,4
76473,It may have been my batteries but the light wasn't that bright.,76473,4
76473,I didn't need it for the light so I didn't mind.,76473,4
76473,Shipping was fast and sooner than expected!,76473,4
76474,Really a beautiful swimsuit!,76474,4
76474,The pattern and cutout is great and I really like the look of it.,76474,4
76474,"Because of amazon reviews, I ordered a size medium, as I am usually a XS/S, and even then it was quite snug but fit well enough.",76474,4
76474,I'd say go two sizes up for this one.,76474,4
76474,"Other than that, it's a pretty swimsuit.",76474,4
76475,"Maybe a little too sticky for a new walker, but great once they get more sure-footed.",76475,4
76475,Was a bit small for my kiddo.,76475,4
76476,I've washed it twice.,76476,4
76476,So far seems to be good quality.,76476,4
76477,Fits great leather quality could be better,76477,4
76479,"these are a little tight, but i love the look and colorful pattern",76479,4
76480,"My last review was rejected for no reason, so here it is:

Good jewelry
Good quality
Good, great.",76480,4
76481,"I'm a DD cup so the bra is a little small but okay
The panty runs very tiny.",76481,4
76481,"If your okay with that, it's a nice bikini for the price!",76481,4
76482,This dress is a little larger than I expected so it doesn't hug the curves the way I wanted.,76482,4
76482,But it is perfect for work.,76482,4
76482,No issues with the stitching and the shipping was on time.,76482,4
76482,Would buy from this seller again!,76482,4
76483,"I like it but they come too big, the s-m is more like a medium rather than small.",76483,4
76484,Fit just like the model pic.,76484,4
76484,"For the price, how can you beat it.",76484,4
76484,"I think it looks hot,  what about you?",76484,4
76484,"BTW, I'm  wearing a size small with 32dd 26 36",76484,4
76486,"top fit perfectly, bottom's are a little small",76486,4
76487,Buckle is a bit larger than desired but it works for a watch requiring a 24mm band.,76487,4
76487,I used it for my 42mm Apple Watch and it makes it look awesome.,76487,4
76487,Wish there was an option for a darker color buckle to match the watch.,76487,4
76488,The products are smaller than I thought they would be but otherwise they are just fine.,76488,4
76489,Very soft fabric and the fit is good.,76489,4
76489,Also the print looks nice- not cheap.,76489,4
76489,I'm 120 lbs and I can tell these would stretch quite a bit more.,76489,4
76489,I would love it if a company made these type pants with the wide yoga tops so the elastic didn't create a squeeze line at your waist.,76489,4
76491,The Nike sign is all glitter.,76491,4
76491,This is not in the description.,76491,4
76491,Would not have bought it for my son if i saw that.,76491,4
76492,I bought this hat for my baby (currently 6 weeks old) because it was listed as being for new born to 6 months.,76492,4
76492,The hat itself is a good quality and really cute.,76492,4
76492,It has been washed a few times and still holds its shape.,76492,4
76492,"However, the size is quite large.",76492,4
76492,My baby's head has been measuring large (90+%) and it currently drowns her head.,76492,4
76492,"I know that there will be room to grow, though, so I am hanging on to it.",76492,4
76492,The ties are easy to tuck out of the way for now but I could see how they might be useful once she grows into this thing.,76492,4
76493,Absolutely better in person than in photo.,76493,4
76493,The color and look of this owl is very rich.,76493,4
76493,I have received a lot of compliments on this piece.,76493,4
76493,Would be a great fashion jewelry piece for an owl lover.,76493,4
76494,I bought two of these to hold small cosmetic and bathroom items for my daughter and I.,76494,4
76494,Mine leans a bit to the side but still does the job.,76494,4
76494,The smaller size is perfect as we have very little counterspace in both bathrooms.,76494,4
76494,I have owned mine for several months now and it is holding up well.,76494,4
76494,My daughter uses hers for nail polish and she loves it.,76494,4
76495,Fit our 22 lb child very well.,76495,4
76495,Keeps him warm on these cold nights.,76495,4
76497,"I love the design of this hat, and I love minions!",76497,4
76497,"Hat fit will for me as an adult female, 5'5"" with medium head size, but for my husband it was a little small.",76497,4
76497,"Clearly this came from China, and took a while to get delivered.",76497,4
76497,Hat was made of good quality yarn.,76497,4
76497,"""Hair"" on top appears just like a minion's would and hopefully will stay that way for years to come.",76497,4
76498,Very nice looks just like the picture,76498,4
76500,"As this is my first time purchasing a waist trainer, I did my homework on waist-trainers and found this one.",76500,4
76500,I read all of the comments and figured I'd give it a try.,76500,4
76500,I have only had it for a couple of days and seems ok.,76500,4
76500,"I like that it is made of flexible material, I can still breathe in it.",76500,4
76500,Would recommend yo someone else.,76500,4
76500,"Although I've only had it for a couple of days, I am able to reach the last hooks and will need to get a size smaller in the next week or two.",76500,4
76501,Not the best quality but its good for the price.,76501,4
76501,Will buy again after this one wears out.,76501,4
76505,I bought this shirt for the gym initially but it wasn't the greatest since it was a little thicker than I like them.,76505,4
76505,Not a bad shirt.,76505,4
76505,I actually ordered the sweater and loved it.,76505,4
76505,Made better and with really soft material.,76505,4
76506,Most comfortable flip flops around!,76506,4
76506,And these are my 5th or 6th pair of black ones because unfortunately one of the thong parts always breaks on me!,76506,4
76506,ALWAYS and they're not repairable and Havaianas will not ever make good on it.,76506,4
76507,"I really like the cardigan, good quality as opposed to what other reviews had to say, it looks just like the picture and is soft and cozy!",76507,4
76508,"I love Vans slip-ons, but note that these come in MEN sizing.",76508,4
76509,The shirt fits good besides the arms.,76509,4
76509,The sleeves were a bit tight.,76509,4
76510,So it will be much better after fewmore days.,76510,4
76511,I would probably buy more in the future,76511,4
76512,"Very plush fabric, loosely cut design so as to be extrememy comfortable for lounging.",76512,4
76512,"Crotch is low, as pictured (about mid-calf), so it looks more like Pikachu.",76512,4
76512,Zippered drop seat is nice.,76512,4
76512,My daughter loves this!,76512,4
76513,Great item for layering under another top where you don't want to see two collars.,76513,4
76513,Stretchy - fits snuggly as expected.,76513,4
76513,True to color pictured - a good neutral cream.,76513,4
76514,I like it a lot,76514,4
76515,"I bought the two pack of beige and teal, and one by itself in gray.",76515,4
76515,The gray one didn't ship from Amazon so it took longer but there were some physical differences compared to the ones that came in the two pack.,76515,4
76515,The gray one had a less fuzzy suede tag (C.C) in a reddish brown color - the tag on the teal and beige one is much softer and in my opinion a nicer shade of brown.,76515,4
76515,The gray hat's C.C tag just looks a bit cheaper.,76515,4
76515,The gray beanie was also a bit smaller than the other two and didn't contain a care label inside like the others do.,76515,4
76515,The softness of the knit is about the same in all of them.,76515,4
76515,They all aren't very slouchy but still pretty cute.,76515,4
76515,"Overall, not bad for the price.",76515,4
76516,"Really pretty, but very short.",76516,4
76516,I needed to wear shorts underneath.,76516,4
76517,shirt material keeps me a bit dryer and more comfortable on hot summer days.,76517,4
76518,The only bad thing is the plastic material stick !,76518,4
76518,Lose the color when stick it self!,76518,4
76518,"I order small , fit perfect",76518,4
76519,"The shirt fit great, but the very bottom fit right?",76519,4
76520,"I really like how these make everything look, vibrant and sharp, but they are a little flimsy and doubt they will last a long time.",76520,4
76520,"I know they are only about $5 so I am not complaining for that low price, I only wanted to mention it.",76520,4
76521,"Cute, but ran really big.",76521,4
76521,About a size and a half larger than expected.,76521,4
76522,go up 2 sizes.,76522,4
76523,The tunnels look cheap but mainly bought for the tapers which are good each pair came in bags indicated size they were in mm tho instead of the usual gauge sizing I was used to so looked up a converter,76523,4
76524,These socks are too thin for my liking.,76524,4
76524,I prefer thicker socks.,76524,4
76524,So I really can't ding them for making quality dress socks that are thin.,76524,4
76524,"My wife loves them, though.",76524,4
76526,The socks are a little big for my 11 month old but the band is tight enough that they won't fall off.,76526,4
76526,They are not too thick so they're perfect for summer.,76526,4
76526,They had a kind of chemically-smell when I took them out of the package but that should go away after the first wash (will update after).,76526,4
76526,"I was looking for a light-weight, non-skid sock that my son could wear during the summer on our hardwood floors and this product filled that need exactly.",76526,4
76526,I was a little wary of ordering since all the 4 star reviews were sponsored but I am happy with my purchase.,76526,4
76526,"Thought it probably doesn't mean anything, there is awkward English on the packaging (see photo).",76526,4
76527,Cute jacket for teens.,76527,4
76527,This jacket runs a bit small as my daughter wears a size 02 and it fits her perfectly,76527,4
76528,These were really great and the colors are nice and bright.,76528,4
76528,"The fastener on one of them broke after two wears, though, so that's why it lost a star.",76528,4
76528,"I used this for a costume for a play, so I was able to just sew the garter to the sock and use it throughout the run of the show.",76528,4
76528,They fit well and stay up for hours and hours of dancing and running around.,76528,4
76528,They hand wash really well and the colors don't run.,76528,4
76529,Lovvvveee dey shoes Lil narrow but very comfy it will stretch after wearing it frequently,76529,4
76530,It is a very pretty dress and looks like picture.,76530,4
76530,If you have larger boobs get a size up because it has no stretchness.,76530,4
76530,Also is is very see through so you need a dress slip.,76530,4
76530,My only real complaint was it did not come with see through straps.,76530,4
76530,Arrived in time and was in good condition.,76530,4
76531,Didn't know there weren't pockets... that's my only sad face...otherwise I love it!,76531,4
76533,I like this hat.,76533,4
76533,Very warm and looks nice.,76533,4
76533,Only concern is how long it will last.,76533,4
76533,The brim has what fells like cardboard within it.,76533,4
76533,The instructions also say to hand wash.,76533,4
76533,I'm not sure if it will how up well once wet.,76533,4
76533,This could be due to washing or rain.,76533,4
76534,Bought these for my 14 year old grandson..He's totally thrilled with them.,76534,4
76534,The shipping on them was quick.,76534,4
76534,The only negative I can give is the head strap.,76534,4
76534,"Not really steam punkish, and not easily adjusted..",76534,4
76535,Big enough for an adult or small enough for a child.,76535,4
76535,I purchased this color and love it.,76535,4
76535,"I was skeptical about it fitting an adult  as well as a child but, it does.",76535,4
76535,My 3 y/o granddaughter tried it on and she likes it as well.,76535,4
76535,This kept my head warm during the frigid temperatures and recent blizzard.,76535,4
76536,Definitely buy two sizes up.,76536,4
76536,I normally wear a medium in shirts and I bought an extra large.,76536,4
76536,The shirt is really sheer and see thru so you will be wearing a shirt underneath.,76536,4
76536,The price was perfect which is good because it takes a long time to be shipped.,76536,4
76537,Fit well.....looks like photo,76537,4
76538,Light and breezy -  will be checking out others,76538,4
76539,"Easy to put on, comfortable to wear, shiny!",76539,4
76540,"The print is beautiful but the fir is strange... Too tight in the shoulder area, too short and too wide.",76540,4
76540,I guess its meant for someone short and pear shaped.,76540,4
76540,"I am 5'7, 120 pounds and the shirt is a medium.",76540,4
76542,It looks brown in the picture.,76542,4
76542,The description does say that the band is BLACK.,76542,4
76542,The little rhinestones seem well attached to it.,76542,4
76542,I was delighted with how it looked when I got it in the mail.,76542,4
76542,The material was much darker than I had anticipated.,76542,4
76542,It smells like fake leather.,76542,4
76542,I'm hoping the odor will go away in a few days.,76542,4
76542,I enjoy the small ticking sound of it.,76542,4
76542,It looks stylish and seems very durable.,76542,4
76542,"If the smell went away, I would give it five stars....",76542,4
76543,I usually wear an XL in koi scrub tops and bottoms but these were too big -especially the scrub top which is surprising because I have a very large bust.,76543,4
76543,The pants are ok since they have the tie so they are wearable but the top is just massive.,76543,4
76543,"I'll keep the set since for just the pants, the super cool long sleeve and the socks is still a good deal but I am sad about the shirt.",76543,4
76544,"Like this dress... colors are great, fit was great but zipper on back broke before I even was able to wear.",76544,4
76544,"I have a friend who is a seamstress so she fixed for me, so I still think it's worth the affordable price!",76544,4
76546,I was delighted when I opened the package.,76546,4
76546,I wore it this morning and I got compliments on it.,76546,4
76547,The skirt is almost knee length and floats up in the water so you look like a frog on a lily pad during water aerobics.,76547,4
76547,"I cut off a couple of inches and tacked it at the seams, which helped.",76547,4
76547,I use a salt water pool and the royal blue has faded to nearly white on 2 panels.,76547,4
76547,But it fits good!,76547,4
76548,"I got 14"" biceps I ordered a large but the arms are too baggy but everything else fits as expected",76548,4
76549,This necklace is actually pretty cute.,76549,4
76549,Only fault is that it doesn't always stay in place and has fallen off a few times.,76549,4

76551,"I adjuste because it was a little big for me, it looks amazing.",76551,4
76554,"Love the feel of the leggings but as far as ""plus"" size goes these are a tighter fit than some XL leggins I already own",76554,4
76555,"Cheaply made, but for the price I feel you get what you pay for.",76555,4
76555,Nice costume jewelry or for a girls stocking stuffer.,76555,4
76556,I'll probably get another one in a different color!,76556,4
76557,It fits a little weird on the bottom because it kind of flares out on the sides but it is super cute.,76557,4
76557,I never buy yellow but decided to with this one and it is already one of my favorites.,76557,4
76558,Looks great and are comfortable.,76558,4
76558,The lens is easy to scratch so be careful.,76558,4
76559,too small by about 2 sizes,76559,4
76562,Seems like a good watch.,76562,4
76562,"The picture gave me the impression that the watch face would be much, much larger than it actually is.",76562,4
76562,"It's more of a unisex watch than I expected, I guess.",76562,4
76562,"But it still looks good and I like it, got some compliments on it today.",76562,4
76563,Beautiful and I get lots of compliments,76563,4
76564,Nice quality material and fits well.,76564,4

76565,"Its .925 silver, fits like any other bracelet and its cute.",76565,4
76565,"Not flimsy or anything and I like how it looks...
***This is my 2nd bracelet!",76565,4
76565,I ordered another because I lost my first.,76565,4
76565,"Still love it alot, it's my daily bracelet, if I don't have any other jewelry on I have this on.",76565,4
76565,That's why when I lost it I had to reorder!!,76565,4
76566,Very nice semi- sheer top.,76566,4
76566,The color is as pictured.,76566,4
76566,The small fits like a medium.,76566,4
76566,I will give as a gift and order all the colors in xs,76566,4
76567,"very cute, but missing the TY tag",76567,4
76568,Returned the suit because it was bigger than expected in the wrong places for me (bust).,76568,4
76568,It was well made and could be a really nice suit for someone else.,76568,4
76569,The material is nice and it is a nice length but I ordered the large and it fits like a small.,76569,4
76570,I like the pants and they are comfy but a little short.,76570,4
76571,I'd say these are probably 18 gauge.,76571,4
76571,A little longer than I wanted; they're as long as the one put in when I got my eyebrow pierced to allow for swelling.,76571,4
76571,I may try to fix that by adding a bead on the barbell before I screw the cap bead back on.,76571,4
76571,"I only got one duplicate, but I think it will be fun to mix and match the cap beads.",76571,4
76571,Fantastic for the price.,76571,4
76572,Pretty cute and great for the money,76572,4
76573,"I wear this as a casual sexy shirt (using fashion tape to avoid any....""wardrobe malfunctions"").",76573,4
76573,"The shirt definitely appears longer on the model than it truly is when you wear it, so maybe order a size up?",76573,4
76574,Really liked this blouse was a bit small.,76574,4
76574,I could still wear it but it's tight.,76574,4
76574,My measurements are 34-26-40.,76574,4
76574,Tight around the bust area and i'm 34b which is small in the US.,76574,4
76574,I would recommend a medium if you are my size.,76574,4
76575,"All good, nice buy.",76575,4
76578,"Fit as expected, I wear 12-14 and order a 16.",76578,4
76579,Nice material but doesn't stretch.,76579,4
76581,Seem to be smaller than I expected so I returned it.,76581,4
76581,It's so pretty I regretted having to send it back.,76581,4
76582,Kinda see-through because of the burnout style.,76582,4
76582,I am a small for everything but it fit a little too snug for me so I am returning for a medium.,76582,4
76582,I shouldve listened to the reviews in the first place and just bought the medium!,76582,4
76583,Normally I bounce between a small or medium.,76583,4
76583,I read the reviews & bought medium-sized but they are a bit snugg.,76583,4
76585,The brim is quite big which is good for the sun but makes it hard to adjust the hat without someone else to help.,76585,4
76585,Also the little toggle is at the back which means she can't sit in her car seat or lay down while wearing it because the toggle would push her head.,76585,4
76585,But it's nice and keeps her shaded,76585,4
76586,"Good quality, came exactly as it looks in the pictures.",76586,4
76586,My only complaint is that it's a bit too big to wear around my wrist - I wear is as an anklet instead.,76586,4
76586,Overall I'm pretty happy with it!,76586,4
76587,These shorts were amazing for halloween and really completed my outfit.,76587,4
76587,The one thing that was kind of a bummer was the fact that they were way too small on me.,76587,4
76587,I have a bigger but and it was basically like wearing underwear.,76587,4
76587,"Still, these are super cute.",76587,4
76588,Very Happy with this top.,76588,4
76589,Im 145 lbs and size medium fits big.. as of quality i think its made out of good material..,76589,4
76590,24m size fit my 20# 8 month old who wears size 12m clothes.,76590,4
76590,Bright colors w cute ruffle and matches the iplay pink well.,76590,4
76591,I have narrow calves and can lace these tighter to accommodate.,76591,4
76591,"They aren't the highest quality, but a great price and i still get tons of use out of them.",76591,4
76591,This is the second pair I've bought.,76591,4
76592,"A little big, but still nice, especially with a darker top, as it shows up more (:",76592,4
76596,Pretty nice- I like it.,76596,4
76597,It's a nice dress  just the arms was too short,76597,4
76598,I love my sweet cherry waist cincher!,76598,4
76599,Looked great but felt a little cheap.,76599,4
76599,"Overall, I am happy I spent a fraction of the price for the same result.",76599,4
76599,I recommend this product.,76599,4
76600,"I like the hat, but the band keeps getting unhooked from the plastic hook.",76600,4
76601,I handed them over to my 17 year old niece....,76601,4
76601,This bra will not provide any lift...,76601,4
76601,"They will give you protection and some hold, but no lift.",76601,4
76601,"This is for younger girls, who just need coverage or for women that do not need much support.",76601,4
76601,My niece loves it!,76601,4
76602,this is great material to wear to prom everyone love this dress on,76602,4
76604,"Does run small, order 1 or 2 sizes up if you like your sweaters with room like I do.",76604,4
76604,Image is brighter than the product but the product is still decent- nothing of too much concern.,76604,4
76605,"I ordered it one size larger thinking it was going to be too small, but should have ordered her actual size,",76605,4
76606,Nice swimsuit but my daughter didn't wear it.,76606,4
76606,The buttins on it seems littls loose scared they may fall off while wearing.,76606,4
76606,Wished they coukd have fake ones look alike buttons don't do anything on suit but just loose,76606,4
76607,I ordered 2 sizes bigger as suggested but still ran a little on small side.,76607,4
76607,A lot longer in the torso than I expected and I'm 5'7.,76607,4
76608,"Chain is cheap, but that's easily replaceable.",76608,4
76609,only complaint is there are plastic hoops that connect the strap to the shoulder.,76609,4
76609,One of them broke after not much use.,76609,4
76609,Should be a better quality of plastic.,76609,4
76610,I really like the hoodie a lot.,76610,4
76610,Get so many compliments on it.,76610,4
76610,The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I ordered a XXL based off the size chart they had.,76610,4
76610,I'm 6'1 and weigh 250.,76610,4
76610,Fits little loose around the body but if I extend my arms the sleeves are perfect.,76610,4
76610,"Should I have got an XL?, or maybe I'm just used to my hoodies being a little more of a snug fit.",76610,4
76611,"I ordered this skirt in the smallest size available, size 2, and it was pretty big in the waist so it didn't fit properly when I received it.",76611,4
76611,I was contemplating if I should keep the skirt or if I should return it.,76611,4
76611,I decided to keep it and get it taken in in the wait and I'm so glad I made that decision because this skirt is perfect for all occasions and is super adorable!,76611,4
76612,Needs more pockets and thought it would be bigger as a weekender bag :(,76612,4
76614,My son wore this t-shirt along with this hoodie: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XD6AJ2W?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 for his 3rd birthday party.,76614,4
76614,"The shirt is high quality, bright colors, and the black did not fade out after washing a few times, like so many black children's shirts do.",76614,4
76614,I'm happy with this and would buy it again!,76614,4
76615,Runs a tad small but very happy with purchase.,76615,4
76616,Want a pair in every color.,76616,4
76617,Cute headbands but does not fit small babies.,76617,4
76617,Will keep for when she is a bit bigger/ older,76617,4
76618,"very long shirt, much longer than i anticipated.",76618,4
76618,but otherwise i like it,76618,4
76619,I'll get the cons out of the way first.,76619,4
76619,"Runs very small, netting doesn't stretch to support a larger package.",76619,4
76619,Won't hold an erection.,76619,4
76619,I gave them 4 stars because of the benefits.,76619,4
76619,"The small tight fit drives the wife wild, it's a very sexy look.",76619,4
76619,"I didn't buy them for everyday wear, or they'd get one star.",76619,4

76620,Love this color and the cap is nice!,76620,4
76620,I previously ordered a black cap which I LOVE.,76620,4
76620,This cap is not exactly the same as the black.,76620,4
76620,The brim is shorter and seems wider than the black cap.,76620,4
76620,Guess the pattern is different.,76620,4
76620,Prefer the length and curve of the black cap.,76620,4
76620,Still a good cap and price is great.,76620,4
76621,For the price this is a nice shirt.,76621,4
76621,"Very thin material, but it arrived sooner than expected no issue with the service.",76621,4

76623,This set is so cute !,76623,4
76623,The robe stretches and is very comfortable!,76623,4

76623,"I have wide hips and a big behind , so I was a little hard getting the thong on without breaking it ,but once it was on I felt sooooo sexy.",76623,4
76623,"I give it 4 stars because I accidently ripped the robe but one stitch can fix that.oh, and the bra is kind of minimal coverage , I'm a 34 c and it makes my breast look bigger than they are lol.",76623,4
76623,No complaints here .,76623,4
76623,I wore the robe to a lingerie party and all the girls wearing Victoria secret asked me where I got it from'',76623,4
76624,Looks ok... A bit large and the back part is baggy.,76624,4
76624,"The ankles are quite big as well, but it can be altered a bit if you know how to sew.",76624,4
76624,"It looks exactly like the pictures on the mannequin, not the model.",76624,4
76625,Im glad they didn't hurt my ears and it's so pretty!,76625,4
76626,Construction appears to be high quality.,76626,4
76626,".I was expecting a 4"" gusset, but this comes with a knife edge.",76626,4
76626,"However, the neck opening is large enough to accommodate several hangers.",76626,4
76626,It's long enough for my maxi tops and very light weight.,76626,4
76626,It will be perfect for my train trip because there is limited luggage space in my roomette.,76626,4
76627,"Very happy with the quality of the shoe, very light, colors are bright as well super cute shoe overall!",76627,4

76634,Its a bit roomy on her but I will have it adjusted.,76634,4
76634,She is on the slimmer side so it will definitely be perfect for a girl with a more body.,76634,4
76635,"I like this item a lot, just that I am into silver tones, but this is a good piece for a dramatic gypsy look when I am going gold.",76635,4
76636,"Has an amazing look, only thing with the hoops is that it is extremely hard to put on.",76636,4
76638,I want to buy one for myself!,76638,4

76643,Overall the dress was not bad.,76643,4
76643,It is very short and runs small.,76643,4
76643,I wear a 5 in pants and a small to medium in shirts so I just ordered a large to be on the safe side and it fit perfect was tight in the book area I'm sure because I wear a d cup.,76643,4
76643,I didn't care much for the point in which the waist stopped on the dress.,76643,4
76643,I added tool under mines to give it the more poofy look.,76643,4

76651,Purchased for my wife.,76651,4

76652,I will need to alter the suite as the fabric almost goes to my knees.,76652,4
76652,I prefer for the top to be the length of the shorts.,76652,4
76653,One of the better purchases I've made off amazon in recent memory.,76653,4
76653,"I've been meaning to get a pair of 6"" platforms for a while but never seemed to find ones that would fit me.",76653,4
76653,Finally I discovered these on Amazon.,76653,4
76653,I'm very familiar with Demonia boots (the parent company) and have owned a few pairs before.,76653,4
76653,"Honestly, you're not getting the greatest quality with their shoes, but the price is right and much better than a comparable pair of, say, New Rocks.",76653,4
76653,"For $100 and free two days shipping, I couldn't be happier with these boots.",76653,4
76653,"I ordered a size 10 and to be honest, they're a little large for me.",76653,4
76653,"I normally fluctuate between a 9.5 and a 10, depending on the brand, so YMMV, but I'd say order down, just in case.",76653,4
76653,"Definitely order a good pair of insoles, as these are *not* the kind of shoes you want to be wearing all day without them, but with a nice pair of Dr. Scholl's that I got years ago, I was able to wear these to a convention and walk around for about 12 hours in complete comfort.",76653,4
76654,it has pockets and is nice for the ;money,76654,4
76655,To be honest I don't know if I like it  the think is that is to white than my skin Dx,76655,4
76657,"love the way they fit great product only down fall is they are a little too short at the 5/8"" I need 7/16"" to fit better other than that metal is great didn't infect my nose or have any kind of reaction",76657,4
76658,material is thin and see through.,76658,4
76658,the color i received is more of a pink coral not a dusty pink as shown.,76658,4
76658,material does wrinkle easily,76658,4
76659,The setting is too big for the stone but I still get compliments.,76659,4
76660,I've been looking for a cowl neck hood for a while now and thought I would give this one a chance.,76660,4
76660,This is a great hoodie dress!,76660,4
76660,Very stylish for the price.,76660,4
76660,Order this if you are 5ft3in and want a dress.,76660,4
76660,This would be more of long top if you are tall.,76660,4
76662,I have only had for about two weeks now but it fits nicely and is not too wide.,76662,4
76663,My girl loved it,76663,4
76664,I ordered a swimsuit for my 14 year old daughter.,76664,4
76664,Going shopping with her is a headache and it took her 3 days to find this particular suit online.,76664,4
76664,The bottoms are really small for a large.,76664,4
76664,So I would say the bottoms run small the top really doesn't have a whole lot of support for heavy busted teenagers.,76664,4
76664,For the price we were able to use the bottoms with another top.,76664,4
76664,If you need a quick swimsuit and you have lots of tops and bottoms this is the way to go.,76664,4
76664,The bottom print is very very pretty and everyone complimented her on the print.,76664,4
76664,She wore the bottoms with another time from another swimsuit and it really looks good.,76664,4
76664,Not something I would buy again but not everyone's body is the same.,76664,4
76664,The quality of the material was really good.,76664,4
76664,Even though the bottoms were small they were very stretchy and they did not rip while still giving her a lot of support.,76664,4
76665,"Not as high quality as other bodysuits, but for the price, a good deal.",76665,4
76665,"They'll get ruined anyway, so I don't need something that can be handed down generation to generation.",76665,4
76666,Seems like a decent flannel but I had no idea it would be so big.,76666,4
76666,It says it is a medium but it fits like an extra large.,76666,4
76666,Maybe this is normal for their products and I was just unaware but for anyone else unfamiliar with this brand I would say order at least one size down.,76666,4
76666,Edit: I've changed the rating to 4 because I gave it to my dad and he said it was a very good flannel.,76666,4
76667,"Fit me well, but the sequins were really itchy.",76667,4
76667,Had a great time in Vegas with it!,76667,4
76668,A pleasure to do business with you.,76668,4
76669,"It does the job well, but she does tend to get rather warm in it.",76669,4
76670,"Cool shoes, they make me feel fly, comfortable, stylish.",76670,4
76670,"Potential costumers such as McDonal's female employee, French RATP bus driver, and stranger accidentally met in a Parisian street say  these is a pair of Marty Mcfly shoes!",76670,4
76670,Where did u get them?,76670,4
76670,I'm a huge fan and i've been waiting for a long time to buy them.,76670,4
76670,But wanna know if this is power lacing.,76670,4
76670,When I get the power laces ones I will be able to answer them I'm back to the futur.,76670,4
76670,So get ready for the latest version of Marty Mcfly shoes mass production.coz it's s gonna sold out within days ir weeks I think.,76670,4
76672,I think it's really nice and a way to raise awareness for all the Warriors out there.,76672,4
76672,For my sickle cell warrior Isiah,76672,4
76673,"Love this shirt, I had to cut the neck out because we'll it choked me, it was way tok tight.",76673,4
76673,I cut into a boat neck shape and put a few stitches on the ends to secure it.,76673,4
76673,It fits much more flattering than with the collar on.,76673,4

76679,"They look exactly as they do in the picture, possibly even better.",76679,4
76679,"They're a bit short, so if you have a lot of hair or a big head- maybe not for you.",76679,4
76679,"It fits me fine, though.",76679,4
76679,They do extend like headphones do.,76679,4

76687,I normally wear a medium.,76687,4
76687,The pants hit the ground so anyone taller this might not work for you.,76687,4
76687,"It is so cheap (I got it for $14.99) am surprised it has such bad reviews, it's solid if this is the sort of thing you like, I am wearing it to a costume party.",76687,4

76692,I ordered one size up as other reviews suggested and was happy I did ...,76692,4
76692,The colors on this are beautiful and the dress is sooo comfortable.,76692,4
76692,"I found the dress to be plenty long , coming to my ankles and I am 5'10 .... Would def recommend",76692,4
76693,Good gripping but a tight fit for my 7.5 foot.,76693,4
76694,"These are much redder than they appear in the picture, more like a cherry red.",76694,4
76694,"But they are beautiful in my hair and they work really well, so I can't really complain.",76694,4
76695,I normal wear a mens 9.5 US shoe in Nike (pretty true fit most of the time) but this style runs small.,76695,4
76695,Having to return them for at least a 10.,76695,4
76695,Order a half size up.,76695,4
76697,Love it looks like it's made it cheap material but it's still cute,76697,4
76698,"Fit is a bit large, although I ordered by the size chart.",76698,4

76700,I felt dust-like particles on my fingers.,76700,4
76700,I cleaned them with jewelry wipes.,76700,4
76700,Now they look (and felt)  much better.,76700,4
76700,The necklace looks good around the neckline.,76700,4
76701,This shirt is a nice color.,76701,4
76701,The only thing I didn't like is that it has slits on both sides that I didn't know about.,76701,4
76701,They go up quite high so I have to wear a tank top underneath which I was not expecting to have to do.,76701,4
76701,I still do like it though and like the high low concept.,76701,4
76702,My niece loved these!,76702,4
76702,Bought for a gift for her.,76702,4
76703,I purchased this head scarf for my sister who lost all of her hair this year after going through chemo for ovarian cancer.,76703,4
76703,I knew she did not want to do a wig but also refused to go in public bald.,76703,4
76703,I looked around online and found this and purchased it.,76703,4
76703,The head scarf is extremely soft and that was perfect since her scalp was sensitive.,76703,4
76703,We love the colors because you can match it with so many outfits.,76703,4
76703,The one downfall on the headscarf was when we got it there were no directions on different ways to use it.,76703,4
76703,We stood there confused on what to do.,76703,4
76703,So not ever having used these before I think there should be a list of directions on how you can style with them.,76703,4
76703,We were at a loss.,76703,4
76703,I recommend the hair scarf and even though my sister is growing her hair back she is still using it and so do I!,76703,4

76703,We are very happy.,76703,4
76703,This product was a personal purchase for myself at normal retail price.,76703,4
76704,Based off of the reviews I ordered a 2x mentally prepared for it to NOT fit like a 2x.,76704,4
76704,"It's a little tight and the material is thin, will have to get a good full girdle to smooth everything out.",76704,4
76705,I put a button in the middle just to cover up a tad.,76705,4
76705,And true to size,76705,4
76706,"As soon as I put this shirt on, I noticed that my arms became abnormally large.",76706,4

76706,"I normally don't act like this, but I learned that that's just what happens when you buy Macho Man memorabilia.",76706,4
76706,I haven't been the same ever since ordering this shirt - the madness continues to run wild.,76706,4
76706,"I have random ""OOOOOH YEEEAH!!""",76706,4
76706,outbursts in public and have been kicked out of schools and libraries for my aggressive tone and threats.,76706,4
76706,My wife and family are extremely concerned about me.,76706,4
76706,They've had to bail me out of jail 7 times in the past month for putting people through tables and dropping elbows at the bar.,76706,4
76706,"Eventually, they'll come to understand that when I wear this shirt, I'm just too hot to handle and too cold to hold.",76706,4
76706,"With this shirt, I am, indeed, the cream of the crop.",76706,4
76706,"In all seriousness, the shirt is a little small but I'm happy with it (I'm 5'8, 190lbs).",76706,4
76706,I recommend ordering a size up.,76706,4
76707,"Nothing wrong with it, but the material is pretty cheap.",76707,4

76713,Love it very comfortable,76713,4
76714,Very warm and fits pretty good.,76714,4
76715,"Thin, but expected it.",76715,4

76719,Would give it 5 stars but dress came unsewn in 2 places after one wear.,76719,4
76719,Still worked great for our event.,76719,4
76720,"Good fit, shorts are very long, Good quality, hold up to washing well!",76720,4
76721,"It had weird material, sort of stretchy thin, it was a bit too it big on me because I don't have a big cup size",76721,4
76722,Havent really had an opportunity to wear it yet but it's cute.,76722,4
76723,It was bigger than expected but like it.,76723,4
76724,I love these loungers!,76724,4
76724,"We used to call them ""house dresses"" or ""dusters"".",76724,4
76724,They are easy care and decent enough when you answer the door that it doesn't look like y just got up!,76724,4
76724,It runs a little small but not enough for me to return it.,76724,4
76724,I would suggest ordering a size up if you like them a little more roomy.,76724,4
76725,Item is much bigger than it looks in the picture!,76725,4
76725,You can use as a small purse.,76725,4
76725,My iPhone will fit in it leaving plenty of room for your passport (two can fit) and credit cards.,76725,4
76725,The strap is adjustable and long enough to wear as a cross body bag.,76725,4
76725,The strap is a bit thin so I would not suggest overloading it with heavy items.,76725,4
76725,Over all good deal for $4.99.,76725,4
76725,You also get two luggage tags!!,76725,4
76727,Not bad for the price I had to alter a little but good for the price,76727,4
76728,Not as bright as the photo but shipped quickly and is of decent quality.,76728,4
76729,Im lucky i order big for my children because it fit her perfectly.,76729,4
76729,Order a size or two up...fits real small.,76729,4
76730,Only had it for a few weeks but its a nice case and seems well built.,76730,4
76730,Hinge spring is pretty strong and snaps shut nicely.,76730,4
76731,Very lightweight and easy to nurse.,76731,4
76731,Don't really need a cover cuz of the extra material,76731,4
76732,Everyone loves this coat on me!!,76732,4
76733,I live in a sunny climate so I sometimes use this to shade my newborn during walks- it does the trick even though it's still really big on my child (4 weeks).,76733,4
76734,"fabric is thin, but colors are nice, feels soft.",76734,4
76734,"my daughter is 5'5"" and it is VERY short on her, barely fingertip length, shorts are a must underneath..looks cute though",76734,4
76735,This hat is big for my 6 month old (even though the kid has a huge head).,76735,4
76735,"It turned out to be a little too cumbersome to use on our beach vacation, although I tried!",76735,4
76735,He also loved the string ties and I was nervous when he was wearing the hat in the stroller because I couldn't keep an eye on him.,76735,4
76735,I'm hoping it fits his noggin a little better for the summer months - I'll have to update my review at that time.,76735,4
76736,It fits really well..,76736,4
76736,"I'm 5'10 215 and it fits perfectly.. my only issue is its not as long as I thought it would be, it stops at my ankles.",76736,4
76737,"The amber tint, ample polarization and wide lenses make these fantastic shades for the beach!!",76737,4
76737,They really brouht out the beautiful greens and aquas in the Gulf of Mexico without altering all of the other beachy colors.,76737,4
76737,Gave only four stars because I think they should cost just a bit less (at $35.00) Otherwise great!,76737,4
76739,The star kind of looked like a flower and my daughter-in-law didn't want to put it on my grandson.,76739,4
76740,Loved the color n wording,76740,4
76741,Just got my tongue rings.,76741,4
76741,I didn't have any duplicates which is great!,76741,4
76741,I had one ball that came shattered.,76741,4
76742,"Beautiful shirt, size OK.",76742,4
76742,"It felt ""sticky""and had a weird smell.",76742,4
76742,It was fine after I washed it.,76742,4
76743,I ordered a size small to fit my petite body structure but the fit was a bit loose.,76743,4
76743,I wanted it to fit snug on my body.,76743,4
76744,I bought these because I like the bands at the bottom of the legs but they stretched out after the first month.,76744,4
76744,They are a great weight and very soft but I'm disappointed the ribbing isn't better.,76744,4
76745,Only wish they were real leather.,76745,4
76745,Comfy and stylish and perfect for work when you're on your feet a lot.,76745,4
76746,They're perfect for comfort at work while still looking professional.,76746,4
76746,They do shrink a bit in the wash the first time but I'm short so that actually was helpful for me.,76746,4
76746,"I'm 5'2"" and weigh about 126.",76746,4
76746,I got the 4 and 2.,76746,4
76746,They both fit but I sometimes like my pants to look tight or be a little looser depending on my outfit.,76746,4
76746,They do tend to fall apart but I enjoyed my time wearing them and will order more.,76746,4
76746,I got about six months wear out of mine before they were basically destroyed but I wear them for work everyday so it makes sense they'd wear out sooner.,76746,4
76747,I just wish it was a little longer and had better stitching on the bandeau part with a bit longer of a ruffle.,76747,4
76747,"It's a nice, light and flowy dress, though, and I'd buy it again.",76747,4
76747,Just wish for a few improvements.,76747,4
76748,My arthritis certainly isn't worse.,76748,4
76748,I wear it everyday.,76748,4
76751,I knew this dress would run small so I ordered a size up but for comfort I really should've ordered 2 sizes up!!,76751,4
76751,"I like this dress though, it is comfy, kind of short though but that's most fitted dresses.",76751,4
76752,Very cute and great for Hot days.,76752,4
76753,It's a little short for me but will go great with leggings.,76753,4
76755,Great first day of school dress for my kindergartner.,76755,4
76755,The top ran small and the buttons pulled a bit.,76755,4
76755,"My daughter usually wears a 5, but the 6 ran smaller than expected.",76755,4
76755,I would suggest ordering up if in doubt..,76755,4
76756,Looks great with my leggings & boots.,76756,4
76756,Can dress it up or casual.,76756,4
76757,It was what I expected was very happy the way it fit.,76757,4
76757,It just smelled a little funny out of the package so I just washed it before wearing it.,76757,4
76758,It's a good sized bag for the things I like to have with me when I'm out and about.,76758,4
76758,"I was a little disappointed that the nylon was not sturdier, but it works well for a casual, errand-running bag.",76758,4
76759,I ordered a small and I'm naturally a size 26-27 in the waist.,76759,4
76759,Very pleased with the fit.,76759,4
76760,"After getting medium and them being too small, I got a large pair, fit better, but I'm not a large person usually...",76760,4
76761,I'm usually a US size 6 but I decided to order both a 6 and an 8 just in case.,76761,4
76761,"The 8 wound up fitting better, so you may want to go up a size.",76761,4
76761,"Despite that, it was still a little tight in the shoulders.",76761,4
76761,The color was a beautiful burgundy and the length was great.,76761,4
76761,"I'm 5'3"" and the dress came down to my knees.",76761,4
76761,It's a really classy looking dress that would work well for a lot of occasions.,76761,4
76761,"However, there's so much padding in the bust that it almost feels like I'm wearing a bulletproof bra.",76761,4
76761,I'm a 34C/D and the padding in addition to that made me look ridiculous.,76761,4
76761,"Ultimately, I returned it.",76761,4
76761,"If you're a smaller bra size or you're willing to take the padding out yourself, the dress might work better for you.",76761,4
76763,My 4 year old son was so excited to get these in the mail for our Disney trip!,76763,4
76764,The image shows it bigger than it really is.,76764,4
76765,"I am 5'0, 225lbs and I bought a 2XL for reference on sizing.",76765,4
76765,"It had a removable belt, and it looks great with a cardigan!",76765,4
76765,The only problem I can say I had with the dress was the neckline.,76765,4
76765,"It turned outward, but it isn't too much of a problem and it can be fixed easily.",76765,4
76766,"If you are a shorter person, this will likely be a little long.",76766,4
76766,"It just barely covers my kneecap, and a proper kilt should rest just above the knee.",76766,4
76766,Otherwise it is a fantastic kilt.,76766,4
76767,"Cute, with an amazing price.",76767,4
76767,Using them for Xmas gifts.,76767,4
76768,"It was really cute on, a little tight on the waist area but I liked it.",76768,4
76768,Ordered a small and I'm 5'5 and 120lbs.,76768,4
76768,"If I ordered a medium, it would have been too big.",76768,4
76769,"I cut off the bottom ""balloon"" hem and now I love it.",76769,4
76769,If your not built like a stick I suggest cutting off that hem.,76769,4
76769,I love the print.,76769,4
76771,This shirt seems super comfy.,76771,4
76771,The fit is just a little weird.,76771,4
76771,I usually wear a medium pre-pregnancy but ordered a large because my belly is already pretty big.,76771,4
76771,I don't think a medium would have fit around the back and belly and the sleeves would have been too short.,76771,4
76771,"The neckline on the large is just a little too big, but again, a smaller size wouldn't fit.",76771,4
76771,"I love the feel of this shirt, and I think once I get a little bit bigger it will be perfect, and you really can't beat the price.",76771,4
76772,"For a quick costume idea, these are a great set of horns.",76772,4
76774,"very nice design, just like my favorite money clip wallet - but now with RFID protection!",76774,4
76775,"Very cute, we just have to wait for her to grow no to it .",76775,4
76775,It seems to run much larger than the US sizing I'm used to.,76775,4
76776,Like the boy cut of panty area.,76776,4
76778,nice and cool on my head,76778,4
76779,I bought this bathing suit and it definitely fit my expectations.,76779,4
76779,For the price the material is durable.,76779,4
76779,"I ordered a XL-I am 5'6"" 150 lbs.",76779,4
76779,the bathing suit fit a LITTLE snug but nothing that I would go through the trouble of returning it for.,76779,4
76779,It was more so smaller with the torso length not so much the general fit.,76779,4
76779,"There is padding for the girls, however they aren't sewed in place so you do have to adjust them when you put the bathing suit on, but they seem like they would stay put while swimming.",76779,4
76779,Overall I would buy this again!,76779,4
76780,I ordered a large expecting it to bra smaller fit n it was perfect,76780,4
76781,"Came just in time for my Florida trip, so the earlier part of the expected dates.",76781,4
76781,"Fits as expected, but I always know the bottom half will be tighter on me than pictured.",76781,4
76782,They are double flared so the only problem is that my ears are irritated from putting them in also the flares are huge on them as well.,76782,4
76782,They are way cool an comfortable though!,76782,4
76783,"She likes it, and she wears it ;)",76783,4
76784,I like the bronze look and leather.,76784,4
76785,"I loved the quality and cut, but it runs small so I had to return it.",76785,4
76786,I really like the fit and thickness of the material of this dress!,76786,4
76786,The dress is very flattering because of the heavy weight material and the way the ombre colors are laid out.,76786,4
76786,I had never ordered clothes from Amazon before and was very impressed.,76786,4
76786,The dress is form fitting (body con) but still somewhat conservative because of the cut and the length.,76786,4
76786,Great for a wedding or cocktail party.,76786,4
76787,My 13 year old has an Irish fetish due to Jack Septiceye.,76787,4
76787,"I though he would love this sweatshirt  but was just kinda ""meh"".",76787,4
76787,"It may be that he is shy about the shamrock placement, which had not occurred to me until he was wearing it.",76787,4
76787,He might consider this a girl's racy sweatshirt.,76787,4
76788,This dress is so nice but runs small.,76788,4
76788,I ordered a size 8 and it was too tight.,76788,4
76788,Then I ordered a size 10 Wichita was still tight but the bust was a little big.,76788,4
76788,"Am 5,9 and about 160lb.",76788,4
76788,The second size I ordered came  torn on 3 different  sections.,76788,4
76788,Was so disappointed  so I had to hand sew it since  I didn't have  enough time to return and get another one.,76788,4
76788,The next day I was attending the dinner and I wore the dress and it got torn again.,76788,4
76788,Was so mad cz I had no back up dress so I hand sew it again.,76788,4
76788,"I had a bad experience with the dress  but , the dress stole the function.",76788,4
76788,"Everyone loved it, go so many compliments.",76788,4
76789,i just got mine today and it fit as expected but when i raise my arms it rides up my butt... and it is a little thin but not too bad (:,76789,4
76790,It's a really pretty ring.,76790,4
76790,I've looked at quite a few 5 stone rings and I really like the shape of this one.,76790,4
76790,The stones stick out more instead of set into the ring itself.,76790,4
76790,I'm not sure how it will hold up because I just got it.,76790,4
76790,It does look like the real one the color of stones.,76790,4
76790,I will have to say tho I'm not real keen on the bow shape holding the stones on sides.,76790,4
76790,That's just a taste preference tho.,76790,4
76791,Order is what I wanted thx,76791,4
76792,"The back pocket is great for more than ""conceal carry"".",76792,4
76792,(unless eyedrops and eyeglass cleaner count) I don't own or like guns but I love pocketbooks with lots of pockets and this fits the bill; and it is super cute.,76792,4
76793,Cant beat them for the price but they are a little small.,76793,4
76793,The squiggley one was a little too small but I was able to open it up a little.,76793,4
76794,I love it and it looks just like ti does as pictured.,76794,4
76794,"My only note would be that although it is adjustable (you can bend it to open more), it seems like it's meant to be a mini ring i.e.",76794,4
76794,"only slides down on the finger to the first knuckle, not all the way down the finger where you would wear a normal ring.",76794,4
76794,"But this doesn't bother me, I actually think it's cuter this way.",76794,4
76795,"Love the shirt fabric, style, etc.",76795,4
76795,- Just wish I had ordered a size up.,76795,4
76796,"A bit small, but I still like it.",76796,4
76796,I got it on time and had a good experience with the seller.,76796,4
76797,Received many compliments on this jacket.,76797,4
76797,Definitely not rich leather look but nice quality nonetheless.,76797,4
76798,So simply yet so chic.,76798,4
76798,Got so many questions and compliments on it.,76798,4
76798,My only complaint is that the arm bands are still a little snug.,76798,4
76798,The fault is totally on me but I did order a size larger than usual because of this.,76798,4
76798,I ended up just removing the elastic bands on the arm bands and it's perfect.,76798,4
76798,Fits well everywhere else.,76798,4
76798,The leg slits are a little short like everyone else's reviews say.,76798,4
76798,But I have short let legs so it's not much of a problem than a quick snip and stitch can't fix.,76798,4
76798,Thinking about purchasing the other colors as well,76798,4
76799,"For an extra large, it fits more like a medium.",76799,4
76799,"Thankfully, I suspected it would so I purposefully got the bigger size.",76799,4
76799,"It's snug as leggings should be throughout the length of it, it's just the waist band that's a bit tight.",76799,4
76799,"The pattern is very pretty, but the colors are more muted than shown.",76799,4
76799,"Not dull, just not as bright.",76799,4
76799,"Overall, I'll pleased and will be keeping them.",76799,4
76801,I like them but they are just a little to big.,76801,4
76802,Love the color but the chains too small,76802,4
76804,So I've actually bought two of these dresses.,76804,4
76804,"The first dress I bought in a size medium, and I liked it a lot.",76804,4
76804,"The dress was long enough to pass the ""bend-over"" test (I'm 5' 10"" so this is an issue) and the material was opaque, beautiful, and flowy.",76804,4
76804,"It was however slightly baggy, so when I ordered again I decided to go with a small.",76804,4
76804,"While the ""bagginess"" issue is better, the dress is dangerously short and I won't be able to wear it without leggings.",76804,4
76804,"I don't even dress particularly conservatively, but the dress is objectively quite short.",76804,4
76804,There was a difference in length of several inches between the two dresses.,76804,4
76804,"Therefore, if you're a taller girl (like 5' 8""+) I'd get a medium or above to ensure you're not flashing anybody.",76804,4
76805,I'm very large on top so it didn't button to well but beautiful shirt to say the least!,76805,4
76805,Wish it fit better.,76805,4
76806,love the dress and fabic.,76806,4
76806,just so hard to order a size from a china mfg.,76806,4
76806,"even they have size chart, but that will never been accurate...either too big or too small.",76806,4
76806,I need to return and re-order.,76806,4
76806,But thanks Amazon for the free return service.,76806,4
76808,"nice wool, not sure if it's cashmere.",76808,4
76809,its does the job.,76809,4
76809,i live this thing.,76809,4
76809,only downside is that you can still see the hooks thru the zipper even under clothes,76809,4
76810,This jacket is pretty good for the price.,76810,4
76810,"It's made okay, I wouldn't expect it to hold up for years and years, but it was great for our show and probably will last us another few years with light use.",76810,4
76810,"Stitching isn't finished well, so just make sure you clip off those loose strings.",76810,4
76810,Will probably buy some more of these in the future.,76810,4
76811,It was big but served it's purpose.,76811,4
76812,"even though I ordered an extra large, it was somewhat small.",76812,4
76812,.but fabric is nice - just order up a size - service was fast,76812,4
76813,I bought this outfit for my daughters 5th Birthday Princess Glam Party and it was perfect for the occasion.,76813,4
76813,In the future I would pair it would another shirt so I could get more wear out of the tutu.,76813,4
76813,But please with my purchase and if it falls apart later I am okay with that too because nothing last forever with my daughter things happen.,76813,4
76814,These are comfortable and easier to don than the zipperless stockings.,76814,4
76814,"They have helped with a pain in my foot; however, they don't sem to be helping with the swelling of my feet caused by fluid retension.",76814,4
76815,Working for a halloween costume.,76815,4
76815,Fits my 6 year old son and I just fine for a halloween event.,76815,4
76816,My nephew loved it!,76816,4
76817,"I am 5'3, 120lbs with a 32DD bra and a large fit me perfect",76817,4
76818,I really liked this dress.,76818,4
76818,I used it as a wedding dress for a second marriage.,76818,4
76818,I got many compliments,76818,4
76819,I ordered a size bigger as forwarned and it fits great on my beautiful 2 year old grandaughter.,76819,4
76820,It's simple but a bit quirky which is what I like about it and it spiced up my little black dress nicely.,76820,4
76820,I will say that the red triangles were a bit smaller than I expected (they look bigger in the photo) so it's not a huge accent necklace but it's still nice.,76820,4
76821,They are really cute but not super slouchy.,76821,4
76821,The band is snug and the rest is just slightly loose and I have a small head.,76821,4
76822,"These are great, especially at this price.",76822,4
76822,My only issue is they are hot and not very breathable.,76822,4
76822,Even still they are comfortable under dresses and much better than sweaty panties!,76822,4
76822,I wish they would make a cotton version of these that are equally affordable!,76822,4
76824,I love this design!!!!,76824,4
76824,I've wore it a couple times & it compliments any look.,76824,4
76824,I think it looks exotic if you know how to throw a look together too.,76824,4
76824,"The chains are cheaply made obviously, so be careful with tugging & pulling on it because it will break.",76824,4
76825,Looks great but I orders a large and it fits more like a medium.,76825,4
76826,runs a bit small.,76826,4
76826,I ordered XL which I normally wear L-XL but it does not wrap around my body.,76826,4
76826,"Still wear it and love it, just wish I would have gotten a larger size",76826,4
76827,"I ordered the X-Large Black jacket and I am 6'3"" and 200 lbs.",76827,4
76828,"It's okay at first, but when you wear those for a long time your feet will get uncomfortable because of the sweat.",76828,4
76828,"Also, I waited for such a long time to get one pair of slippers from China.",76828,4
76829,I purchased a medium because I would be a small in US sizes and this dress is from China.,76829,4
76829,It is a little loose and not as form fitting as I would have liked but otherwise it is a great dress for the price.,76829,4
76829,With the 3/4 sleeves and the heavier material it will be great for fall.,76829,4
76829,I do like the cut of the dress and where the skirt sits.,76829,4
76829,I have very religious in laws and I usually dress modest around them so this will be great to wear to their house.,76829,4
76829,I needed more dresses like that.,76829,4
76830,Works for those pants that you can't zip up or button anymore and you still want to wear them.,76830,4
76830,Gives good support as well.,76830,4
76831,It's Asian sizing so order a size bigger than you'd normally wear.,76831,4
76831,I'm usually a medium/large but I typically buy an extra large if it is pants/skirt/romper but I might have been able to get away with the large in this case.,76831,4
76831,It's a little big up top but I'm still keeping it :) I think it will be a cute summer outfit,76831,4
76832,"I'm 5'10"" 160lb and ordered a large which is my normal size for long sleeve tops.",76832,4
76832,"It fits well and even the sleeves are long enough on me, although understandably it is a bit shorter on me than some of the ladies in their photo reviews.",76832,4
76832,I still rock it with some thick leggings though.,76832,4
76833,Too small but i like it still,76833,4
76834,I usually wear size medium.,76834,4
76834,Glad I read reviews and sized up.,76834,4
76835,These gloves are great.,76835,4
76835,They work like a charm.,76835,4
76835,I bought them for a friend who took them to Yosemite this winter and she said they worked perfectly for her.,76835,4
76835,Saved her hands from the biting cold while she was on her phone.,76835,4
76835,It's amazing what the little technology-fibers can do.,76835,4
76835,And they are cute and very warm.,76835,4
76835,The insides feel so soft.,76835,4
76835,I definitely recommend these gloves.,76835,4
76836,I am a bit upset because it seems I need to lose some weight lol.,76836,4
76836,Great stockings but too narrow for my legs.,76836,4
76836,"I am in Europe and my size is S (hips 58 cm each, bottom 103 cm).",76836,4
76836,I think they will be great for skinny girls XXS/XS.,76836,4
76837,"Nicely made, Perfect look of the butterfly with the decorations in the wing.",76837,4
76837,Looks great with my tye dyes,76837,4
76838,So cute and the adorable bib to match!,76838,4
76839,Very nice but padding could be a little thicker,76839,4
76840,I was expecting a bigger bag then what I received but nevertheless it's a super cute bag and I still got a lot of compliments on it.,76840,4
76841,Cute and works as described.,76841,4
76841,Prompt delivery from vendor.,76841,4
76842,"The colors are not as vibrant as I'd hoped, but the graphic is beautifully reproduced and stands out nicely against the distressed fabric.",76842,4
76843,There are less gems on it then in the picture.,76843,4
76843,This dress otherwise is great aside from the fact that it is a little short but I still love it but be warned there are still as I said before less gems on it then in the picture.,76843,4
76844,Ordered large fits perfect good quality,76844,4
76845,Good for the price and as described,76845,4
76846,A little big but I feel if I would have ordered a size smaller it'd be too small.,76846,4
76846,It's cute and looks fashionable.,76846,4
76846,I'd say it feels pretty warm but its not cold out to find out just how warm.,76846,4
76846,I ordered a size larger than I would have normally,76846,4
76847,Cute shirt for my lil girl but some of the threads came lose,76847,4
76848,Nice the blue is a little lighter than picture,76848,4
76849,Really happy with this product.,76849,4
76849,This is a high quality product.,76849,4
76849,This kinds of bags go for 200-300 in boutiques.,76849,4
76850,Got some of the cutest pics with this but as it was a bit small to begin with it didn't get a lot of use.,76850,4
76852,Loved the material and super soft!!,76852,4
76852,Only thing is it does run somewhat small..,76852,4
76853,I give this four stars based on the quality for the price.,76853,4
76853,I had to return as the item was too small for me.,76853,4
76853,The sizing is comparable to US junior sizes.,76853,4
76854,I got it for a flat footed man in need :) that is all day one his feet and additionally wants to hike.,76854,4
76854,"From what I've heard, they do deliver better than famous over counter gell soles.",76854,4
76854,"I tried them myself (though too big for me) just to have a feel, and I did find good support and comfort with soft top layer.",76854,4
76854,"These were made in Germany, advertise as extreme shock protection.",76854,4
76854,"They are thin and not bulky although consist of 6 layers (microfiber velour, memory latex, fibre pile, shock-absorbing orthopaedics layer, heel grip, gel heel cushion), can be easily trimmed if necessary.",76854,4
76854,"Size women US 11 supposed to match US 9.5- 10 in men, 43 EU",76854,4
76855,Really enjoy these they seem to be working so far the glasses them selves feel pretty cheap but they don't look that way so you get what you pay for and I payed well,76855,4
76856,"Just received my sweater, (hey don't judge it's for a costume) :) it's a little snug but I'm sure it'll stretch out a bit by the time I need to have my costume ready.",76856,4
76856,"Also, estimated delivery was into mid June and got it today (May 27) It's nice and soft too, so no itching!",76856,4
76857,The fit is a lil to small I have a lot of booty but they look good on my,76857,4
76858,"I guess this is for stretching pointy toed shoes-boots
I am going to have to heavily modify this to make it fit for my needs.",76858,4
76859,I bought this because it was 4$.,76859,4
76859,"I have to say I was impressed, while it did shrink after washing for the price of a new hoodie you just can't beat it!",76859,4
76861,Neck hole kinda large.,76861,4
76862,I thought it would run small but it was close to true size.,76862,4
76862,Shrunk a little in wash.,76862,4
76863,The size is good but unless you garment is really tight it will get a little loose in between.,76863,4
76863,I wrapped a ice bandage to hold the top part otherwise it gets kind of loose.,76863,4
76864,Really pretty - I love the burnt sienna color.,76864,4
76864,It's light weight but you can't see through it at all.,76864,4
76864,The sleeves have a way you can roll them up and keep them that way.,76864,4
76864,Very cool for the summer heat.,76864,4
76865,Thank you I love it !fits perfectly got tons of compliments.,76865,4
76866,It was a little difficult removing the film off the foam but otherwise this worked exactly the right way!,76866,4
76866,Made the hat fit perfectly.,76866,4
76867,"Beautiful dress, long, only problem I had with it was the back which you do have to tie.",76867,4
76867,harder than just regular zippers,76867,4
76868,This suit is well made.,76868,4
76868,I had low expectations for it and was genuinely surprised.,76868,4
76868,"The only cons I found were that the legs were extraordinarily long, and around the face, there is no hem, creating a very cheap appearance.",76868,4
76868,"We used it for my 4 year old to dress as Catboy, so she had a mask and you couldn't see it.",76868,4
76868,"Overall, it got the job done, and she was happy with it.",76868,4
76870,It will be a gift.,76870,4
76870,Was looking for a little more,76870,4
76871,It's a beautiful dress and made well.,76871,4
76871,Runs small in size.,76871,4
76872,Not too bad to iron either.,76872,4
76873,"The blue/orange one just ripped off the first day that he puts it on, but the other one is good so far.",76873,4
76873,I ordered the 24 months and my brother just turned 2.,76873,4
76874,This is a stunning dress and looks and feels expensive.,76874,4
76874,I ordered a medium and I am usually a medium in tops and dresses and 6-8 in pants.,76874,4
76874,My husband loved this dress and complimented me on it!,76874,4
76875,Nice ~ Mom and baby a little flat but okay,76875,4
76876,So these flowers are BEAUTIFUL.,76876,4
76876,"The backs/stoppers though are loose, well most of them.",76876,4
76876,So I just use my rubber stoppers which is why i took off a star.,76876,4
76876,With everything else they are fun and I really like them.,76876,4
76877,"I normally fit a large nicely but this one is a bit too big, I still can use it, but it does not stay body tight, maybe go a size smaller.",76877,4
76877,Apart from that its nice and cute.,76877,4
76878,I have to wear these as high wasted pants in order for them to fit comfortably.,76878,4
76878,There is also a small hole in the right pocket but since I don't plan on using them anyways its not a big deal to me,76878,4
76879,The whole skirt is made of a spandex material that looks like denim but fits like a bodycon skirt.,76879,4
76880,My wife likes the wallet/clutch but it has a very strong chemical smell.,76880,4
76880,Hoping it will fade away shortly.,76880,4
76881,"I may have to buy another one b/c it has stretched a little, but recommend it!",76881,4
76882,My expectations were based on the previous reviews of this garment and they seem pretty accurate.,76882,4
76882,I usually wear a medium/8/10 in bottoms so I went up a size and purchased a large.,76882,4
76882,The bottom part fits fine but the top half is too loose.,76882,4
76882,I wore a bandeau top to keep the girls covered and secure.,76882,4
76882,"Overall,  I like this romper.",76882,4
76883,I have used this brand and they are very good.,76883,4
76884,"I'm 5'0 95lbs, I got a size small of course and it fits very well.",76884,4
76884,The material is very thin tho not at all bathing suit material and very stretchy so if the bathing suit is stretched out on you then it will be see through.,76884,4
76884,For me it isn't.,76884,4
76884,"Fits perfect in the front, the back fits good but it doesn't hug my body.",76884,4
76884,I love it as a bathing suit and as a body suit.,76884,4
76884,Came quicker than expected.,76884,4
76885,Did what it needed to.,76885,4
76885,Definitely useful when you are between regular pants and maternity.,76885,4
76887,It takes two hands to zip and unzip.,76887,4
76888,"I bought them for my second job in food service, and these are honestly some of the most comfortable shoes I've worn.",76888,4
76888,I even just started wearing them to my day job as well.,76888,4
76888,I'm a huge guy and I don't even notice I'm wearing them on days when I work 16 hours straight.,76888,4
76888,"They're not very breathable, though, so I notice by the end of the day I'm sweating in them.",76888,4
76888,"Still, these are fantastic shoes, highly recommended.",76888,4
76889,Cute dress to wear to the office.,76889,4
76890,Smaller than it looks online and than I expected but still cute,76890,4
76891,Most of them are super cute,76891,4
76892,It is a beautiful stone and setting.,76892,4
76892,"I wasn't disappointed!~  The chain is almost a 'why bother' and the  bale on the pendant isn't big enough to allow the other chains I have to go through so, I will be shopping for a new necklace.",76892,4
76892,"Otherwise, this would have been a 5 star!",76892,4
76893,"There is a area with yellow in the back, that is the problem.",76893,4
76894,Get tons of compliments all the time.,76894,4
76894,"I have a 39in bust and it fits across, but not lose at all.",76894,4
76894,Rest of it hangs comfortably.,76894,4
76895,It proves to be doing its job just fine and has a unique feel thanks to the texture pattern suitable for the Game's design.,76895,4
76897,"Not that it was the companies fault I should have ordered a larger size , love the item in itself.",76897,4
76897,The make of it is cute !,76897,4
76898,Deliver took forever but it's cool,76898,4
76899,Nice for the money but a little small like others said.,76899,4
76902,Like the color but you need to order a bigger size if you get a 46.,76902,4
76902,Much smaller than I expected!,76902,4
76902,Guess I'll have to lose some more weight or send them back.,76902,4
76902,No stretch in the waist at all...,76902,4
76903,"Item was purchased for a child,, fit is good, durability is good, style and color is exactly what child wanted.",76903,4
76904,I received this dress 2 weeks early which is great!,76904,4
76904,I could not be happier.,76904,4
76904,This dress is GORGEOUS I never expected it to be this beautiful.,76904,4
76904,"I only have one complaint, after sending the company my exact measurements this dress is about eight inches too long, even in my heels its way too long.",76904,4
76904,I ordered a petticoat so I'm hoping it helps.,76904,4
76904,I would recommend this stunning dress to everyone.,76904,4
76904,(Just order it a little shorter than you need it to be) All in all a lovely dress.,76904,4
76904,(Edit)Well I tried the dress with a petticoat and it is still entirely too long now I don't know what to do....I guess necessity is the mother of invention.,76904,4
76904,Still a wonderful dress.,76904,4
76905,It's hard to keep together bc the screwy part is so small but not very noticeable when wearing,76905,4
76907,"I have a rather large bust, long torso so I should have gotten a bigger size but the  swimsuit is very flattering.",76907,4
76907,I get compliments on it every time I wear it.,76907,4
76909,Nice quality but wasn't right for me so was returned and had no issues doing that.,76909,4
76910,Well made and tons of compliments,76910,4
76911,This dress ended up being rather pretty.,76911,4
76911,"The silver lining underneath the black laser cut top is a little shinier than I expected, but the fit around the waist was really flattering.",76911,4
76911,"The top however, was very loose and the straps kept falling off.",76911,4
76911,"If you have a larger chest, however, this may not be a problem.",76911,4
76911,"The biggest issue, unfortunately, is that the dress is too short.",76911,4
76911,"At 5'10"", I would have been unable to wear even flats without it being too short.",76911,4
76911,"Had to return this along with another Ever Pretty dress for the same reason, which was a shame!",76911,4
76912,I'm a small 3/5 and the shirt was perfect.,76912,4
76912,I would say you could order your regular size and assume it's a little larger.,76912,4
76912,But it's cotton so you could shrink it but the style is better larger,76912,4
76913,"This is my 2nd corset from Camellias I like them this style is just a little too much for me at the bottom, I thought it would be good because I always feel like i need it to be tighter at the bottom but the extra piece at the bottom just hangs down there, it doesn't keep you in and I'm not wearing it as a costume or it would be fine.",76913,4
76913,So if you need it for waist training and weight loss maybe this style isn't for you.,76913,4
76913,but over all it is doing it's job.,76913,4
76913,"My waist is smaller already, looks like I will be shopping for a smaller one soon!",76913,4
76914,"I'm normally a size Med & the top fit great, but the bottoms were kinda small and minimal coverage.",76914,4
76914,Easy to find a solid black bottom elsewhere,76914,4
76915,Good quality but it runs small.,76915,4
76915,If you have big boobs it won't cover that much and your nipples will pop out easily!,76915,4
76915,Haha its cute though and it arrived two weeks earlier than expected!,76915,4
76916,"Like the shirt, it is comfortable.",76916,4
76916,"But if you like the band Cheap Trick thinking that is what is on the back of this shirt, it is spelled wrong.",76916,4
76918,Bought this for a vegas trip.,76918,4
76918,"I am 5'2"" and 120lb and this fit well.",76918,4
76918,"I purchased it in the only size available, medium.",76918,4
76918,The only issue was you cannot wear a bra with it because of the open back.,76918,4
76918,I would suggest getting cups sown in.,76918,4
76918,Otherwise it was comfortable and sexy!,76918,4
76919,I ordered my regular size and it fit.,76919,4
76919,The material is soft and comfortable.,76919,4
76919,"I am 5'4"" and it comes to just above my ankles so if you are tall it will be shorter.",76919,4
76919,It came in less than 2 weeks which was as expected.,76919,4
76919,I ordered another dress from a different vendor at the same time and it hasn't left China yet.,76919,4
76919,The only thing wrong is that the arm holes are huge and show my bra.,76919,4
76919,When I went back and looked at the picks they were different than before and show the large arm hole.,76919,4
76919,I don't want to wear a shirt under it so I will have to figure something out.,76919,4
76920,Nice style on a budget.,76920,4
76920,Perfect fit for people with a smaller face.,76920,4
76921,It is nice for the price so that I can give it to my grandkids for Xmas,76921,4
76922,I am 5'2'' and 125 lbs by U.S. measurements.,76922,4
76922,It is a lovely costume as many have shared.,76922,4
76922,I chose the Medium size because of the bust measurement instead of choosing by height.,76922,4
76922,I am a 34C in Bra size but it fit comfortably with a bra on and it was actually ever so slightly loose on the right shoulder.,76922,4
76922,Other than that it fit my petite frame with the Velcro hood on.,76922,4
76922,Would I wear it on a regular day other than Game of Thrones premier night?,76922,4
76922,Oh yes I would!,76922,4
76922,Thank you for shipping it in a timely manner.,76922,4
76923,Smaller than I expected but well worth the money.,76923,4
76924,"I got an extra large, and i'm 5' 5"" and 125 lbs..and it fit me perfect, like a small.",76924,4
76926,Usually larges are a little big on me but these are a little snug.,76926,4
76926,"I am also 9 months pregnant so I'm hoping after the baby comes, they will fit me perfectly.",76926,4
76926,They are amazing quality though!,76926,4
76926,"But because they are a little snug, it's hard to zip them after putting my arms in it.",76926,4
76927,This product is as expected.,76927,4
76927,If you zoom in on the straps you can see the detail on them.,76927,4
76927,The stitching on them is ok but very noticeable compared to my friend's.,76927,4
76927,It is still wearable.,76927,4
76927,The material in our shirts is also different.,76927,4
76927,This one isn't as soft as hers.,76927,4
76927,My shirt is more of a 3/4 length and hers is what I consider an actual crop top.,76927,4
76927,The white shirt in the pics is this one and the grayish white is and old one my friend ordered from a different seller.,76927,4
76928,I bought a size biggest and it very comfortable.,76928,4
76929,This suit is small no matter how you look at it.,76929,4
76929,But it is cheap and it's still pretty cute.,76929,4
76929,"It is a pale pink, not much different from the picture.",76929,4
76929,"It is not well put together, not sure how long it will last.",76929,4
76929,"(The elastic is hanging out a bit in some areas, but nothing crazy noticeable.",76929,4
76929,Just maybe don't wear in chlorine pools).,76929,4
76929,"The bottoms are super cheeky, but I like that, so no problem there.",76929,4
76929,The top is super tiny.,76929,4
76929,Had to take the pads out.,76929,4
76930,I love the hoodie but it's thinner than I thought it was going to be.,76930,4
76931,Great fit and I love the colors.,76931,4
76932,What's not to like?,76932,4
76932,This shirt is awesome.,76932,4
76933,It's a little short in the stride!,76933,4
76934,The dress had such rich texture and was very reasonably priced and I love that I recommend any one purchasing from them your dress will look as displayed.,76934,4
76935,"They have a weird smell out of the box, so I washed them right away.",76935,4
76935,They fit my size 7 feet perfectly.,76935,4
76935,If you are a size 8 or higher they may be too small.,76935,4
76937,Excellent fit - nice color.,76937,4
76937,I was given a pair as a gift several years ago and they lasted a VERY long time!,76937,4
76937,So I chose the Havaianas over other brands.,76937,4
76937,There's no particular arch support but the sole is beautifully thick and accepting.,76937,4
76938,fun to wear..ears will slide so need to bobby pin them where you want them..,76938,4
76939,The Bracelet looks nice on with sturdy clasp/clip.,76939,4
76939,Have only worn it a handful of times.,76939,4
76939,Very pleased with purchase.,76939,4
76940,Bathing suit is amazing and the small top fit perfect but the bottoms were too tight and my bottom was falling out and squished.,76940,4
76940,I wish they had the option to buy one size top and one size bottom.,76940,4
76940,"Had I been able to order a medium bottom, it would be PERFECT!",76940,4
76941,"It's probably more of a 3.5, but I always round up.",76941,4
76941,Pros: It looks great and was easy to install.,76941,4
76941,Cons: the material is thin and overall it feels a bit flimsy.,76941,4
76941,The band is also pretty short.,76941,4
76941,I do not have thick wrists and I have to use the second to last hole on the band.,76941,4
76942,These were just what I was looking for (I don't wear dangling earrings in the winter because they always get hooked into winter scarves and then lost).,76942,4
76942,"The size of the ""pearls"" is perfect and I accidentally bought two sets - one of my co-workers bought the extra set from me and she also loves them.",76942,4
76943,The top was perfect!,76943,4
76943,Supportive of a 32D chest.,76943,4
76943,I am smaller on top than the bottom so the bottoms were way too small.,76943,4
76943,Thankfully I knew that I was only buying this for the top.,76943,4
76944,I purchased both the large and extra-large canvas bag.,76944,4
76944,I had originally purchased the XL and it is way too big for me.,76944,4
76944,"However, I loved the bag so I purchased the L. Unfortunately, the large is also too big.",76944,4
76944,I had planned on using this as an every day bag/purse.,76944,4
76944,I absolutely love the green color and the material is fantastic.,76944,4
76944,The leather is really soft and the canvas is thick and of high-quality.,76944,4
76944,I'm going to end up returning both of them in the hopes that they'll come out with a medium size.,76944,4
76944,Because it's so large it folds in the middle when I'm wearing it cross body.,76944,4
76944,The cross body strap is really nice and thick and extends really long.,76944,4
76944,There are several pockets and the main pocket is lined and very large.,76944,4
76944,I really love this bag and I can tell from the quality that it would last a long time.,76944,4
76944,I took a few pictures measuring and comparing both the L and XL sizes.,76944,4
76945,Super relaxed yet stylish bordering elegant.,76945,4
76945,Nice flow and sturdy.,76945,4
76945,Bottom/hem seemed a bit straighter than desired but it worked.,76945,4
76945,Cute dress for any body type.,76945,4
76946,"the material is not that cheap....
ill suggest to double check the size

its nice to wear at work",76946,4
76949,were a lot bigger than I thought they would be.,76949,4
76951,It's not as cute as it seems on the picture,76951,4
76953,worked its purpose was for her birthday... but didn't last long at all.,76953,4
76953,would purchase for a one-dayer.,76953,4
76954,Perfect accessory for Halloween costume.,76954,4
76955,I knew this ran large and ordered it anyways.,76955,4
76955,It's nice thick fabric.,76955,4
76955,It can be worn probably at 12months.,76955,4
76955,It'd be a good baby shower gift.,76955,4
76957,They fit like tights/legging that are really thin.,76957,4
76957,You have to pull them up like you do when you put on panty hose.,76957,4
76957,If you have a belly pooch ( and aren't at your skinny minnie fitness level yet) the front band will constantly fold over and you'll have to readjust.,76957,4
76957,"I haven't done a hardcore work out in them, just walking and yoga stretching.",76957,4
76957,They don't fall off your butt at all.,76957,4
76957,Perfect for lounging as well if you like wearing yoga pants all the time.,76957,4
76958,"Good quality material, very comfortable.",76958,4
76958,"The crotch pouch is a bit small, but it covers the butt perfectly.",76958,4
76958,I'll buy more of these in the future.,76958,4
76959,I bought this for my niece and she loved it.,76959,4
76959,Made her looked good and charming.,76959,4
76960,I like it but they are a little shorter than I'd want.,76960,4
76960,I'm 5'9 and use to most yoga pants not covering my ankles.,76960,4
76960,Otherwise I like it :),76960,4
76961,Lots of comments from strangers.,76961,4
76962,I ordered these for my friend and I.,76962,4
76962,She has really thick hair so finding a beanie that fits over her hair and ears can be difficult.,76962,4
76962,I noticed it was cheaper to order two than just one so I got the black and purple set.,76962,4
76962,The purple one was actually larger than the black.,76962,4
76962,I kept the black and gave her purple.,76962,4
76962,"Its a nice hat, really soft and stretchy but I just thought it would be a little more ""slouchy"".",76962,4
76962,"Either way, my friend loved hers and it does cover her ears nicely.",76962,4
76962,So I would say they were a good buy.,76962,4
76963,"the arm holes are a bit small, i had to rip the seem and open the hole up a little and re-sew them, and it doesn't close up around my chest, but i can wear it open and got A LOT of compliments on it when i wore it to a concert...I love it!",76963,4
76963,very soft and kept me warm.,76963,4
76964,These work just as expected and are not uncomfortable.,76964,4
76966,The top is amazing!,76966,4
76966,Well made and fits true to size.,76966,4
76966,The bottoms are poorly made!,76966,4
76966,the fit is awkward and runs small.,76966,4
76967,"Nice socklettes, a bit tight but reasonably comfortable, don't slip in use, & wash well.",76967,4
76968,I like the material.,76968,4
76968,They do run a bit long.,76968,4
76968,I purchased them because I am wearing a cast and needed a wide leg pant.,76968,4
76968,They are definitely a wide pant leg.,76968,4
76969,I ordered this coat thinking it was grey sleeves and white drawstrings but actually received a coat with white sleeves so I'm a little confused.,76969,4
76969,But I will keep it because it is pretty cute!,76969,4
76969,"I am 5'6"" and 150lbs I ordered the medium based on reviews stating it runs large and it fits me great.",76969,4
76969,It is a little boxy and does look better open and the wash is not as its pictured..,76969,4
76969,But still an overall good coat..,76969,4
76970,Really nice dress but it rides up and I constantly have to keep pulling it down.,76970,4
76971,The jeans are great quality.,76971,4
76971,I typically wear a size 14 in women.,76971,4
76971,I ordered a 13 thinking that the jeans would stretch and I'd fit into them.,76971,4
76971,My booty is too big haha.,76971,4
76971,Jeans won't go up my butt.,76971,4
76971,So I'm going to have to return them :(,76971,4
76972,It fits very good and it looks great.,76972,4
76973,This is an extremely cute jacket!!,76973,4
76973,I like that it is brown and black so I can wear either color boots or purses with it.,76973,4
76973,The design is form flattering but does run maybe a little on the small side.,76973,4
76973,I normally wear a medium or large.,76973,4
76973,I ordered a large and it fits more like a medium I think.,76973,4
76973,It looks like a more expensive jacket than it is but does have a few quality issues.,76973,4
76973,I noticed a few loose strings here and there and hope when washed it does not start coming a part.,76973,4
76973,"Also, zippers seem to stick a little.",76973,4
76973,I would definitely order another if anything happened to this jacket and will order from this line of clothing again.,76973,4
76974,fits small child maybe up to six years old.,76974,4
76975,This is a nice hat.,76975,4
76975,It is a much darker gray than it appears in the picture.,76975,4
76975,"The color is similar, if not darker, than freshly poured cement.",76975,4
76975,It is a big snug but does fit.,76975,4
76975,It did arrived in a regular square box.,76975,4
76975,It did not have a cardboard hat box with it.,76975,4
76975,"It can be reshaped as similar hats are by getting a standard teakettle, boiling water until the steam whistles out and duck the hat into the steam to reshape it as you desire (do it without scalding yourself, of course.)",76975,4
76975,And it's Stetson so you have some bragging rights.,76975,4
76976,"I wasn't sure on the sizing, since it is a bit confusing, but being about 19 weeks along I do have a belly.",76976,4
76976,I bought this to wear with regular jeans and it does work well to keep them closed.,76976,4
76976,"Will fit better once I'm much bigger, I hope!",76976,4
76977,Returned for something more stylish.,76977,4
76977,Customer service was great!,76977,4
76978,The hat is beautiful but the brim was less pronounced than I expected.,76978,4
76978,It will still get lots of wear this winter!,76978,4
76979,Stones stay in place!,76979,4
76980,"I like it a lot,  it's very stylish and cool.",76980,4
76981,"A good charger, for a solar watch that doesn't get out often enough.",76981,4
76982,"It fit just fine, body wise.",76982,4
76982,"I did order accordingly to warning that they ran small, and it worked out in my favor.",76982,4
76982,"Sleeve length is a little small, but that can't be helped for people he ho have longer arms.",76982,4
76982,"Over all, I'm satisfied with the product!",76982,4
76984,Glasses were packaged well and shipped efficiently.,76984,4
76984,"My only complaint is that the glasses shading was very dark, so unless it was super bright out I felt like I couldn't see when I wore them.",76984,4
76985,These things are great.,76985,4
76985,They are just there when I need them.,76985,4
76985,"Never fumbling for glasses, or worse yet unable to read my phone.",76985,4
76985,"Super sturdy, and look decent.",76985,4
76985,"This is my second pair (I still have the first, just got bored of the style).",76985,4
76986,I like it but unfortunately it's a bit too small for my daughter when I received it.,76986,4
76987,It's more of a peachy color than the pink the pucture shows,76987,4
76988,"Cute maxi dress, it looks exactly like the picture.",76988,4
76988,Its form fitting similar to a leotard feel and long.,76988,4
76988,I'm 5'3 I'll make it work lol.,76988,4
76988,Its kinda see through like leggings so you will need undergarments.,76988,4
76988,"Material feels nice and comfy, will try other colors come this spring.",76988,4
76989,other colors were fine.,76989,4
76989,well made and nice and thick fabric to hide bulges comfortable,76989,4
76990,I bought it knowing it probably wasn't going to do justice for my chest.,76990,4
76990,"I know it's probably more suited for women with smaller chests, mine is a 34D, but I still like it!",76990,4
76990,The back is super cool.,76990,4
76990,"It gives no support, it does have pads inside that slide around a lot.",76990,4
76990,But this is a cool undergarment thing.,76990,4
76990,probably won't buy anymore.,76990,4
76991,It is definitely beachwear not at all what I was hoping to use it for,76991,4
76992,"Not the best constructed, greatest material, or best fitting garment, but inexpensive so for the money, it's a good value.",76992,4
76992,"If you're looking for a comfortable dress to go out in and not have to worry if you ruin it, you've found a great option.",76992,4
76992,"On par with Forever 21 quality, possibly a little better, obviously this dress is not going to last a lifetime but I forsee getting at least 5-10 wears out of it, possibly more if you baby it in the laundry.",76992,4
76992,Nice little number that dresses up super cute with the right accessories and shoes.,76992,4
76992,"Fair warning: it wrinkles easy, so hang it up after laundering to avoid having to iron it.",76992,4
76992,"Fit wise, it's kinda big.",76992,4
76992,"I'm 5'6"" and 125lbs, ordered a small, and it was a little too big.",76992,4
76992,I threw a belt on over it and it looked fine.,76992,4
76992,"If there was an option for an X-small, I would go with that next time however, there isn't.",76992,4
76992,"Length wise, I was personally comfortable with where it fell but I could see some people considering it short, you do have to watch bending over.",76992,4
76992,I also think the neckline is somewhat higher then pictured.,76992,4
76992,I will probably purchase again when a color comes in stock in my size.,76992,4
76992,"Overall, if you're looking for a cute dress to wear out to bars or clubs and be able to spill drinks out without worrying about ruining since you got such a good deal, go for this dress.",76992,4
76992,"Alternatively, if you're looking for a comfortable dress to wear to class or errands, this would also be a great option.",76992,4
76992,"If you're looking for a dress for a more formal event, something you could wear to tea with Grandma, or clothing that is going to last you a while, save your money and pass on this one.",76992,4
76993,"Gorgeous, but for some reason I thought they were pre-drilled.",76993,4
76994,fun to wear - unique,76994,4
76995,I bought for just the overalls.,76995,4
76995,The pants fit large but work for my baby.,76995,4
76995,The shirt is really more coral and fits my 3yo daughter better than my 1yo.,76995,4
76996,Can't wait to give it to my granddaughter!,76996,4
76997,I totally love these!,76997,4
76997,They are tall and so thick!,76997,4
76997,"They are a big big around the leg,  so they do have some trouble staying up.",76997,4
76997,But in boots they've been great.,76997,4
76998,My only complaint is that I wish it had listed it had gold sparkles.,76998,4
76998,"But kinda clashes with the silver in my outfit....will still work though and it's cute and comfy, and I didn't have to shell out a to of money!",76998,4
76999,Best watch I have ever owned.,76999,4
76999,A little bit so links had to be taken off.,76999,4
76999,A little difficult to put on but awesome.,76999,4
77000,Almost but not quite for me.,77000,4
77000,"Im a curvy petite 52, 110 lbs, 32D usually wear an XS or S. I originally purchased the Zipper V Neck in Small and had to return it because it was SO small, and exchanged it for this black jumpsuit in medium.",77000,4
77000,"The black was still a little small on me, but I can make it work.",77000,4
77000,"That being said, have you ever put something on and thought to yourself I cant figure out if I love this or hate it?",77000,4
77000,That was my reaction when I first looked in the mirror and Im honestly still going back and forth on the matter.,77000,4
77000,"It looks a lot better once you add accessories, but no matter what I did, it still looked a little dumpy in the bum.",77000,4
77000,"The neck has two buttons in the back, then is open down to the back waist (something that unfortunately is not pictured).",77000,4
77000,"If nothing else, it is very comfortable and was inexpensive.",77000,4
77000,Definitely looks way better on the model though!,77000,4
77002,"The bag is very nice, however I ordered 4 of the SAME bags and one was totally different!",77002,4
77002,I contacted seller and got a somewhat rude response back.,77002,4
77002,I realize these came from another country but more tact on their part would have been nice!,77002,4

------------- Begin message -------------

happy New Year

Are you saying that one of them will be a little bigger?",77002,4
77002,"Because it is handmade, so there will be a little different, and it is normal.",77002,4
77002,"We have checked your goods, we delivered your goods without problem,

if you do not like it , you would be returned to us.",77002,4
77002,"Because shipping system settings reason,

we are already selling your goods at a loss to you,

but we have delivered to you, about your price, this bags has been well worth to buy it.",77002,4
77002,I tell them that one is different and didn't say one word about the quality and they choose to argue!!,77002,4
77006,"Beautiful but I wish the O-rings fit a little tighter, I've already lost one.",77006,4
77007,A little larger than I expected even though I know that is the style of this kind of sweater.,77007,4
77007,"It is also thinner than I thought, but not worth returning for those reasons.",77007,4
77007,I can still wear it and be comfortable.,77007,4
77008,I ordered this in a size large but found the large to be rather bulky on.,77008,4
77008,It is very thick and you'll warm up pretty fast wearing it.,77008,4
77008,I love the style but found the hip area droops odd where the buckles are.,77008,4
77008,I may need to sew a support stitch to help it out.,77008,4
77008,Otherwise it is a really lovely sweater and I think I may wash it to shrink it down a tad.,77008,4
77009,This swimsuit is great!,77009,4
77009,"I was looking for something that would hide my belly but still be kind of sexy, and this was perfect.",77009,4
77009,"The torso part is a little long and there is a little extra fabric as you can see from one of the pictures, but I am short so that is probably why, and it's not that big of a deal.",77009,4
77009,"My only issue is that my boobs aren't quite big enough to fill the cups, but that's not a huge issue either.",77009,4
77009,"I am 5'2, about 170lbs, a 36c cup, and I ordered an XL.",77009,4
77010,Just started using them,77010,4
77011,"I bought the gold color model its beautifull, i love it brings to chains one long and one shorter.",77011,4
77011,"Four stars because iphone does not fit inside, i don't think any cellphone fits inside really,so for one night forget cellphone and bring only lipstick hahaha..",77011,4
77011,"Anyway I love it, is different thank you fawziya",77011,4
77012,These are great for my plantar issues.,77012,4
77012,They stay sturdy and supportive.,77012,4
77012,I own 3 pairs of these and buy them when purchasing new shoes.,77012,4
77012,I would recommend them for those suffering from flat  feet and runners who need the extra support.,77012,4
77013,"A little long and I am tall, but I can fix that, otherwise it's super.",77013,4
77014,way to big I am 5'1 113-115 athlete build  soooo big ridiculous !,77014,4
77014,"good quality though, no problems with shipping",77014,4
77015,My wife is very happy with this one.,77015,4
77017,The button keeps getting stuck and the shoulder has a little hole,77017,4
77018,Very cute like the material but runs small,77018,4
77019,The compression socks really help my husband.,77019,4
77019,He stands on his feet at his work.,77019,4
77019,The Gold Toe compression socks have helped relieve his tired achy legs.,77019,4
77019,They also decrease the swelling in his legs.,77019,4
77019,He's medical doctor is pleased and the are less expensive than TED hose.,77019,4
77019,He has been wearing them for the past 5 years.,77019,4
77019,So happy Amazon stocks them since our local retailer where we bought them has now closed.,77019,4
77020,Ran this jacket through some harsh conditions including an early winter whiteout in the mountains.,77020,4
77020,"It did keep me warm with extra layers and stayed dry on the inside but after a little bit, the outside was soaked.",77020,4
77020,However it was Just what I needed but I wish it had inner pockets or concealed carry pockets on the inside.,77020,4
77020,I would definitely pay more for those features Hint hint.,77020,4
77020,"Also, the zippers need a little improvement but it's a great softshell.",77020,4
77021,Only complaint is that it's see threw,77021,4
77022,I did buy 1 size larger than I normally wear based off the reviews.,77022,4
77022,They are a snug fit but really nice colors and quality.,77022,4
77022,I definately recommend buying a size larger.,77022,4
77022,Are great value for the money.,77022,4
77023,"It is a bit on the large size, but it is a very versatile shirt.",77023,4
77023,I would recommend it to all who like cotton snap button shirts,77023,4
77024,I am using them for the gym.,77024,4
77025,I usually wear a medium but had read the size runs small so I purchased a large.....fits perfect.,77025,4
77025,They are very comfortable hiking pants.,77025,4
77027,"Cute dress, a little too big but will keep.",77027,4
77027,Will wear in winter with long sleeve sweater underneath.,77027,4
77027,Dress hem is not turned but raw edge merely finished off.,77027,4
77027,I will give it an actual turned and stitched hem for a nicer look.,77027,4
77029,The bottom piece fits perfectly it's just top piece fits a little big but still beautiful and nice just as seen.,77029,4
77030,It was really cute!,77030,4
77030,The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the fabric felt kind of cheap.,77030,4
77030,But you get what you pay for.,77030,4
77030,But the dress was definitely worth the money.,77030,4
77031,"I ordered a 2XL, and expected it to be too small.",77031,4
77032,I love the suit!,77032,4
77032,"However, my bottom is bigger than my top, so the top is a little loose so I ordered another suit one size smaller - incentive to fit into the bottoms!",77032,4
77034,Too narrow around my widest part.,77034,4
77035,Love the look if these pants but they run smaller than expected,77035,4
77036,Bought this for my boyfriend he loves it.,77036,4
77037,"The dress was too small, I am 5ft 1inch 119 pounds.",77037,4
77037,I bought a small.,77037,4
77037,"I could not zip it, so the size chart is a bit off.",77037,4
77037,"The sellers contacted me right away,they were kind, they let me know that they offered custom sizing.",77037,4
77037,"I might purchase one a size up, except for the size this a quality garment, well worth the price.",77037,4
77037,"I do a lot of modeling, so I wanted a bridal look for my portfolio.",77037,4
77037,The quality of the dress certainly fits the bill.,77037,4
77037,The dress was packaged very well.,77037,4
77037,So I will leave an update.,77037,4
77037,I am placing a new order today August 31,77037,4
77038,"Everything fits the look of the picture, fits good, didn't come in damage.",77038,4
77038,"My only problem is that the plate on the watch that says fallout new vegas is smaller than what the picture looks like, other than that it's nice.",77038,4
77039,Very comfortable good for workout but its a bit transparent.,77039,4
77040,I had absolutely no duplicates which was great.,77040,4
77040,"I loved the cheap price but be warned, a lot of the balls have ugly designs but I sort of expected that.",77040,4
77041,"Based on quality alone, I must give these four stars.",77041,4
77041,"They look good, are well made and have progressive dimming which fits perfectly into my daily lifestyle.",77041,4
77041,"For the price, I am sure that one could find better sunglasses.",77041,4
77041,"That said, these are Rayban and I understand that I paid for the name.",77041,4
77041,"Only downside is that Amazon says these were made in America, RayBan says they were made in China and the glasses have ""made in Italy"" written on them.",77041,4
77041,"Nothing wrong with this, but I was trying to buy American.",77041,4
77042,Fits very well around the neck and does not look at all cheap - the fastener is a bit delicate and difficult - not sure how long that will last - but overall very pleased with this necklace!,77042,4
77043,I love diffraction glasses and have many of them.,77043,4
77043,"I prefer the ""nerd style"" flip up ones like this one because you can flip them up to see normal and down for diffraction effect.",77043,4
77043,"Pros
-Low cost
-Much preferred over paper ones
-Fit comfortably
-Won't dissolve in the rain

Cons
-For some reason both the normal lense and the flip up lense are both diffraction - unlike my other pairs where the normal lense is just clear plastic and the flip up lense is diffraction.",77043,4
77043,This may sound cool because you get double the diffraction!...,77043,4
77043,but in reality one diffraction lense makes it hard enough to actually see things around you - two makes it practically impossible.,77043,4
77043,"Looking through both makes it so really all you can see is light pigments, without being able to make out your hand infront of your face.",77043,4
77043,"That being said I found it was preferred to just have one diffraction lense, not two.",77043,4
77043,"To solve this, I popped the lense out of the fixed part of the glasses so when flipped up you can see normal and when flipped down you get the diffraction effect.",77043,4
77043,I ended up using the extra lense that I popped out over my cell phone camera for cool video effects.,77043,4
77043,It would be cool to incorporate this into a cell phone case.,77043,4
77043,Overall it worked as I wanted it to.,77043,4
77043,I would love to see a product like this that allows me to rotate the lense while I wear it so that the diffracted image can move without me having to tilt my head.,77043,4
77044,"I like it, it could be a little better in terms of making belly flat, but it's comfortable to wear and it does give butt a lift.",77044,4
77045,I'm a small woman so I would need a extra small I order a small and it fit as I expected a little loose but still a nice fit,77045,4
77046,"Super cute, do not machine wash though!",77046,4
77046,One of the straps to the top snapped off:(,77046,4
77047,Little tight but fabric has enough stretch to work,77047,4
77048,"Fits nicely, runs somewhat small, long inseams, flattering",77048,4
77050,I absolutely love this belly button ring.,77050,4
77050,It isn't too heavy but I can't wear it constantly.,77050,4
77050,"I am not sure if it is the metal, but my piercing gets aggravated after about a week of constant wear.",77050,4
77050,"So people with sensitive skin, beware.",77050,4
77051,"didn't get the one I ordered, but it was still cute so I kept it anyways",77051,4
77052,Nice quality - runs small,77052,4
77053,My son is who have autism love pepsi products i got it for him he loves it,77053,4
77054,"These probably fit well on the ""average"" girl, but I'm pretty curvy, so they rolled down off of my thighs :/ but overall they were made well.",77054,4
77055,Seems to be working well.,77055,4
77056,"Love this suit,however the crisscross tie in the back could have been a bit longer.",77056,4
77056,Because it is short I have to have my husband strap me into this suit.,77056,4
77056,Cute for a short afternoon at the beach or a pool party but good luck trying to get in or out of it without help if you have to use the bathroom!,77056,4
77056,Bring a friend that's for sure.,77056,4
77056,"As for sixing I had to purchase a XXX-Large (not what a girl wants to do when shopping for a swimsuit) I am about 5'8 and 150, wear a size 10 and am top heavy.",77056,4
77056,This suit covered my top but gave me some cleavage.,77056,4
77056,The bottom part of this suit is super cute as the ruffles on the bottom gives it a cute flirty look with out showing your hiney.,77056,4
77057,I thought it comes in pair with the shorts but it was my bad not reading carefully.,77057,4
77058,Very comfy and stylish,77058,4
77059,"I'm under 5 ' tall, 110 pound ordered an XL and it is not fitting correctly.",77059,4
77059,The waist is at my bust.,77059,4
77060,These socks are too adorable.,77060,4
77060,They fit my 3 month old fairly good.,77060,4
77060,"She's chubby around her feet, so she fills them in good.",77060,4
77060,"I've washed these socks about three times already and the bow is still on just a bit loose, which is why I'm giving a four star instead of five.",77060,4
77060,Also the socks tend to get little lint balls on them quickly.,77060,4
77060,Besides that they are really cute.,77060,4
77060,Lots of people like them and compliment.,77060,4
77060,Wish they had more colors!,77060,4
77061,"Got here quickly, reasonably priced and very versatile.",77061,4
77062,Cheesy looking but worked well for halloween.,77062,4
77063,"Very very nice, good leather, good color.",77063,4
77063,I was concerned it might be too small and it was indeed- I could not fit by standard long HOBO wallet inside.,77063,4
77065,The pink was a bit much for my husband,77065,4
77066,"These fit a little tight, so I made sure to go half a size up - especially if you plan to wear thin socks with them.",77066,4
77066,"These are cool, comfy shoes (for the most part) and I have several pairs in different colors and designs.",77066,4
77067,"It fit me really well but I ordered a size bigger than what the chart said I should get, just to be safe.",77067,4
77067,It only needed minor alterations to the length.,77067,4
77068,"Was a little snug, but the material was good quality.",77068,4
77068,Really like this dress.,77068,4
77069,the actual ring is made of some kind of copper or other pink metal.,77069,4
77069,the silver is only a plating.,77069,4
77069,"would still purchase, but would rather they just keep the original metal instead of plating.",77069,4
77069,still love this ring!,77069,4
77071,I like my hats.,77071,4
77071,They are very comfortable can wear them all day.,77071,4
77071,Will order more as Christmas gifts.,77071,4
77072,A little  big on my son hes 7,77072,4
77073,"The material is a bit noisy, but I looove the pattern!",77073,4
77074,Kinda hard to keep it as the perfect circle once you take it apart to put it on.,77074,4
77074,"Overall, it's a beautiful product.",77074,4
77075,"Since we recently bought several pairs of water shoes, this is feeling a little redundant.",77075,4
77075,We bought these for our granddaughter (6) and she was able to walk for hours in rocky stream without any difficulty.,77075,4
77075,They stayed on and offered fine protection and were comfortable.,77075,4
77075,What more could you ask for - for the price?,77075,4
77076,"I love the material and everything else about the tank, but I feel that it could definitely be slimmer fit.",77076,4
77076,I'm trying to have someone fix the sides to take at least 4-6 inches off so it looks okay and fits right.,77076,4
77077,Too low in front,77077,4
77078,Like it very much,77078,4
77079,Hands-down the coolest t-shirt I own.,77079,4
77080,"The top part fits great, but the waist is tight fitting.",77080,4
77080,I'm still able to wear it though.,77080,4
77080,Made well as far as the material goes.,77080,4
77080,It's very soft and not see through.,77080,4
77081,I read all the reviews about sizing thoroughly before I made this purchase.,77081,4
77081,Here are my measurements to hopefully help other women when picking their size.,77081,4
77081,"I am 5'5""-- my waist size is 28-29 (size 6-8).",77081,4
77081,"Normally that would make me a US medium, but for this I went for the XL and it fit WELL.",77081,4
77081,"Fitted comfortably, not too snug, not too baggy.",77081,4
77081,It falls nicely on my hips like a pair of boyfriend jeans and slim through the legs.,77081,4
77081,The fabric is a good thickness with a slightly elastic give.,77081,4
77081,I wasn't thrilled about having to cut out all the button holes myself and made a couple blunders while sticking my utility knife through the fabric.,77081,4
77081,Good luck on that.,77081,4
77081,Installing the buckles in fine once you figure out how to do it--though it came w/ no instructions and I had to look it up online.,77081,4
77082,"Fabric is polyester and supposed to look like a sweater, but would be nicer if it was actually a sweater, but overall love the design and can't wait to wear for my holiday parties!",77082,4
77083,A little bulky but they work pretty good.,77083,4
77084,My little mermaid loves this gown!,77084,4
77085,"Beautiful fabric, love the print, and was very excited to receive the skirts I ordered.",77085,4
77085,"I wear a ladies size medium, and I ordered the skirts in medium.",77085,4
77085,To my surprise these are NOT sized in ladies sizes.,77085,4
77085,These are sized in JUNIORS!,77085,4
77085,I should have ordered a large.,77085,4
77085,"***UPDATE***
I had filed for a refund because my original order was too small, but decided to leave a note in my package that what I really wanted was an exchange.",77085,4
77085,I am very pleased to say they exchanged the items for me at no additional shipping costs AND they emailed me a prepaid shipping label to return the too small items!,77085,4
77085,Wonderful Customer Service on their end and I am very happy with the product.,77085,4
77085,I am upgrading to a 4 star rating.,77085,4
77086,"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH DRESS FITS NICE, BUT I DID HAVE IT SHORTENED A BIT.",77086,4
77087,"I am 5'6, 150 lbs and I ordered a size M. The dress fits true to size and it's also stretchy.",77087,4
77087,"It is exactly as pictured, the length is perfect to wear with sandals, and the material is very soft.",77087,4
77087,I gave this 4 stars only because the dress is see-through.,77087,4
77087,I will have to wear boyshorts or a slip under it.,77087,4
77088,Somewhat small in the bust area but still fits nicely.,77088,4
77089,"Great support,I spend 8-11 hours a day on my feet the entire time.",77089,4
77089,Could feel the difference the first day.,77089,4
77090,Two compartments which are nice - Love the color - Kind of slow shipping,77090,4
77091,"I really like this piece, but the sleeves are ridiculously too long!",77091,4
77091,"The pattern is really pretty and the length is longer, which is what I wanted.",77091,4
77091,I contacted the company and they offered to give me back half my money.,77091,4
77091,I thought that was a really good deal so I kept the piece and will have the sleeves hemmed.,77091,4
77091,"Once hemmed, this will look great with jeans.",77091,4
77092,"Great hat, perfect to keep cool and out of Suns rays",77092,4
77093,"Nice shirt, but a good bit larger than usual larges that I buy.",77093,4
77093,"I am always a large, but I feel a medium would have fit a lot better in this shirt.",77093,4
77094,I bought this for my 3 year old niece.,77094,4
77094,She is currently fitting into 4t.,77094,4
77094,"I bought this in a 5t for next year, but she is already able to wear it.",77094,4
77094,it is only a little big on her.,77094,4
77094,I would recommend buying a size up if you want it to fit.,77094,4
77094,The picture online also makes it look like the bottom of the dress is a dark pink.,77094,4
77094,It is actually more of an orange color.,77094,4
77094,"If this review was helpful, give me a thumbs up please.",77094,4
77095,The sizing didn't match up.,77095,4
77095,Medium says 32-34 but it starts at 33 according to the box.,77095,4
77095,This made the legs ride a bit and not as comfortable as I thought.,77095,4
77095,"Would like to get another pair to try, but in small",77095,4
77096,Far more prettier than the pictures.,77096,4
77096,Fits as it sizes say however you would have to order bigger than you wear.,77096,4
77096,My big day is a year away so I still have time if I need anything changed but I'm sure I won't it's perfect the way it is.,77096,4
77098,I bought this with the intention of having something a little warmer and professional looking for work.,77098,4
77098,The jacket is very soft and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.,77098,4
77098,It is also extremely warm which is great for the fall and winter weather here in Seattle.,77098,4
77098,"I would have given the item 5 stars but I felt that while the size of the jacket was a good fit, the shoulders were slightly too narrow and I can feel it when I either raise my arms or cross them.",77098,4
77098,It isn't much but it is enough to notice it when you move as such.,77098,4
77098,This one had a hole in the front pocket from me putting in my hands too hand to escape the cold.,77098,4
77098,So the stitching could stand to be a little stronger.,77098,4
77099,I paired it with a jean jacket and received lots of compliments!,77099,4
77100,It was a little smaller than I had anticipated but the material is soft.,77100,4
77100,I gave it to my daughter who seems happy with it.,77100,4
77102,"Thick and very comfortable, but a little too big.",77102,4
77103,Fits perfectly - I am 38C and ordered the 14 .... looks great!,77103,4
77106,"Soft and comfortable, but a bit on the small side.",77106,4
77106,A lot shorter than I was expecting.,77106,4
77106,The model in the picture must have been wearing her shirt  three sizes too big.,77106,4
77107,"After reading the reviews (The suit runs small) I purchased an extra large, I probably could have worn a large just fine.",77107,4
77107,"I am a dress size 10, with 36D bra size.",77107,4
77107,"I have gained weight over the past few years, so bathing suit shopping has not been fun.",77107,4
77107,"My tummy is no longer flat, and my thighs are no longer toned.",77107,4
77107,"I wanted a suit that looked adorable, and didn't make me look pregnant.",77107,4
77107,"I love the vintage look, and was thrilled to find this suit at such a great price.",77107,4
77107,This suit is very flattering for a fuller figured woman.,77107,4
77107,"The molded padded cups cannot be changed, so if you are smaller chested be careful.",77107,4
77107,"I appreciated the thicker cups, as they keep their shape, and look great.",77107,4
77107,I've worn this suit all summer.,77107,4
77107,"The beach for 10 days straight, and many times in the pool.",77107,4
77107,"The color looks just as good as the day I bought it, and the shape has stayed after many machine washes.",77107,4
77107,(I do not put my suits in the dryer.),77107,4
77107,I am so pleased with this suit.,77107,4
77107,I felt confident all summer.,77107,4
77108,"The quality of this bikini is excellent, but the sizing is say off.",77108,4
77108,I think I will have to return it and I'm not sure even the xxxl would fit my bust and I'm a 42 D.  Shame because I really love it.,77108,4
77109,The only thing is that lose the color easily.,77109,4
77110,"VERY BRIGHT, VERY NICE",77110,4
77111,I ordered a size medium I'm 5'3 and weigh about 115 the top fit like a medium and the bottoms fit like a large and were too big.,77111,4
77111,Love the suit just not the sizing.,77111,4
77112,I'm glad I ordered a size up.,77112,4
77112,"Although I expected it to be a little too big, it fits just right!",77112,4
77113,"Its translucent,yet it fits perfect for a short girl like me!",77113,4
77114,"After my c-section, it felt like I had no abdominal muscles.",77114,4
77114,The binder I got in the hospital was way too large.,77114,4
77114,This one fit really nicely and made me feel put back together again.,77114,4
77114,I wore regular underwear under this item to hold a maternity pad in place but I'm sure you could affix the pad to this underwear as well.,77114,4
77114,I didn't wear it for more than 6 hours at a time to allow my body some time to relax.,77114,4
77115,Nice but wrinlkes easily.,77115,4
77117,Grandson loved the jacket!,77117,4
77118,"A little small but not so bad , is cozy and it looks good",77118,4
77119,this was used as dresses for my bridesmaids they fit as expected but the underskirt was too short but my girls were 5'8 and 5'9 so it was way above their knees even though the sheer piece made up for it i had to compensate by having them wear 2 inch heels so it wouldnt be tacky ...so after that adjustment it worked out fine,77119,4
77120,Love the style but it fits like a shirt.,77120,4
77120,"I'm 5""4 and 180lbs.",77120,4
77120,I carry my weight in my boobs and butt so it's a little tight and small.,77120,4
77120,But I will definitely be wearing it over my swim suit or over a tank!,77120,4
77121,The product is great it fits well.,77121,4
77121,Although when I got it it had threads everywhere still great though,77121,4
77122,Fit well and were comfortable,77122,4
77123,"Very cute, but be careful the fabric bled a lot during the first wash.",77123,4
77123,I was worried that white to would stain.,77123,4
77124,"Works pretty well, mostly I wear it to keep non-maternity stretchy pants in place since I am in between normal stuff and maternity stuff right now.",77124,4
77125,"The only problems I can state is that they do not stay up very well, if at all unless you pull them up over your thighs.",77125,4
77125,"Also, somewhat shorter than I was lead to believe.",77125,4
77125,I am 6' even and they barely reached above my knees.,77125,4
77125,Aside from that these were excellent.,77125,4
77126,"Crocs, love to hate them...they serve a purpose.",77126,4
77126,I wear them around the house.,77126,4
77126,They're comfortable and last a long time.,77126,4
77126,They are also inexpensive particularly when you consider their lifespan.,77126,4
77126,They get really slippery as they get older which is why I opted for this style... the idea of no slip is very appealing.,77126,4
77126,Not made for outdoor-noslip-country-dwelling.,77126,4
77126,Every little thing gets stuck in the tiny crevices on the soles and it pretty hard to clean out.,77126,4
77126,"One wearing, stepped in something gross, and for the last month they have been sitting outside abandoned.",77126,4
77126,"Tried hosing them off, scraping them off, scrubbing them off...I realize they are no slip for indoor use, kitchens, but thought they might work well for my around the house use.",77126,4
77126,I imagine they eventually will.,77126,4
77126,I'll just better watch where I step.,77126,4
77127,Nice and cozy and very cute.,77127,4
77128,It's hard for me to find pants that fit my butt sand waist I have a big butt for my small frame (I don't know the measurements) but when I get high waist stuff either the pants smash my butt or there is a big gap in the back.,77128,4
77128,These didn't do either.,77128,4
77128,They fit my waist and complimented my butt!,77128,4
77128,I'm probably going to end up ordering more.,77128,4
77128,Wish they came in more colors!,77128,4
77128,Only disclaimer::::: after wearing them for about a 2hrs they started to slide idk why that happen but I'm an over happy customer!,77128,4
77129,I think the idea behind the belt is awesome.,77129,4
77129,Definitely omits the need to buy maternity clothing at this point.,77129,4
77129,I ordered size 1 because I wore size 2 pants pre-pregnancy.,77129,4
77129,"I'm only 5 months now, but the belt feels somewhat tight.",77129,4
77129,I think I'll be ordering size 2 going forward.,77129,4
77130,I usually wear a small or medium so I ordered a medium.,77130,4
77130,It has stretch that give super body hugs but the side seams are unforgiving.,77130,4
77130,That made it difficult to get on and off without struggling.,77130,4
77130,I sent the medium back and ordered an extra large.,77130,4
77130,"Still a perfect body cling, easy to slip on and off, too.",77130,4
77130,I had to alter the shoulder straps a half inch to make it a perfect fit.,77130,4
77130,The lace was evenly centered and super soft.,77130,4
77130,It feels great against my skin.,77130,4
77130,The only flaw was a bit of the lace on the shoulder strap was cut so I had to put in a couple stitches.,77130,4
77130,No big deal...especially for the price.,77130,4
77131,My daughter really loves these!,77131,4
77131,"They would get 5,stars, but the toe scuffed on the first wear, showing tan under the turquoise.",77131,4
77132,"These are really nice toe socks, especially like the non-skid feature on the bottom.",77132,4
77132,"Only criticism is that the toe area seems a little small, or tight..if that area can be enlarged, these socks would be perfect.",77132,4
77133,"Somewhat small the top part, the dress is really preaty",77133,4
77135,To small for Mom,77135,4
77136,Perfect for what I needed.,77136,4
77137,I have had this wallet for a couple years now and I am still using it.,77137,4
77137,The material is great and has plenty of card slots for cards.,77137,4
77137,I gave this wallet 4 stars because the cards slide down into the slots and get stuck from fabric folding over them.,77137,4
77137,It's a real hassle trying to get them out some times.,77137,4
77138,A little big but still adorable,77138,4
77139,good quality but somewhat large in size,77139,4
77141,Very sheer... No swimming with this...,77141,4
77141,But it sure looks good walking on the beach,77141,4
77142,"Nice coat, very long",77142,4
77143,"Nice shirt, breathable, 5 year old likes it.",77143,4
77144,bought for myself but was way to small do my daughter got it after sewed up the deep plunging v neck,77144,4
77145,This dress is see through and looks cheaply made.,77145,4
77145,"For the price though, it's worth it.",77145,4
77146,Like the colors a bit too big for me  but over all good,77146,4
77147,This bag was just what I was looking for.,77147,4
77147,It is labeled as yellow but I could tell that it was orange and that is the color I chose.,77147,4
77147,It is a simple bag that I can tell won't last too long if not handled with care.,77147,4
77147,This would not be a good bag for a child.,77147,4
77148,Hope granddaughters will like as they have been waiting for PJ Masks items.,77148,4
77149,"I love the bathing suit, just wished I could have sized the top and bottom separately.",77149,4
77150,This necklace match many of my outfits.,77150,4
77150,There is a nice clasp.,77150,4
77150,The metal is a little cheap which is why I would only give it 4 stars.,77150,4
77152,Run a little small but super cute.,77152,4
77154,I had to purchase two of these to get the right size so buy up a size as the one recommended is too small all over.,77154,4
77154,I was also very aggravated that I had to pay to restock my item when I was doing an exchange.,77154,4
77154,I will not do business with Woman Within again over the fact that they were rude and customer service inflexible.,77154,4
77154,The coat is nice but remember it is short so spring/fall but definitely not for any type of sever weather.,77154,4
77154,Do like the hood,77154,4
77155,It was a little loose and it's made of stretch denim.,77155,4
77155,By the end of the evening it was really loose.,77155,4
77155,Wish it wasn't quite so stretchy.,77155,4
77156,This watch strap is fine.,77156,4
77156,"Yes, it's a little bulky and stiff, but I imagine the stiffness will ease with age.",77156,4
77156,"It certainly seems like it will last longer than me, so over all I'm happy with it.",77156,4
77158,"I've only used it for a few days now, so can't comment on durability, but certainly a cute, well made product.",77158,4
77158,The price was right too.,77158,4
77158,No complaints so far - would recommend.,77158,4
77159,This dress is wow.,77159,4
77159,I love it greatly.,77159,4
77159,It brings out the shape in you.,77159,4
77159,One down side is that the material is kinda scratchy since it touches your bare skin and you can't wear anything underneath to prevent it.,77159,4
77159,"Apart from that you will be scratchy in this dress which might be uncomfortable, this is a beautiful dress and i will recommend it.",77159,4
77159,"it looks elegant and classy and not cheaply made, i bought a medium and fits perfectly.",77159,4
77159,i will add photo soon,77159,4
77161,Comfortable but loose at the bottom,77161,4
77162,These were of good quality and fit my size 5 niece and my size 10 as well.,77162,4
77163,Got these for my daughter.,77163,4
77163,They are a little big around the waist but fit perfect everywhere else.,77163,4
77164,Looks nicer in the pic.,77164,4
77165,Seems to run a little smaller than the other ones I purchased,77165,4
77167,Stiffened it with starch and an iron.,77167,4
77167,After this it was great!,77167,4
77167,My friend wore this mask over her glasses which also worked great.,77167,4
77167,I posted a pic.,77167,4
77168,For a pack of 2 tanks you cant beat it.,77168,4
77168,"Works as an undershirt, great for running errands, working out, or just around the house wear.",77168,4
77169,I like this product I wear it all the time so I have to reorder and get more.,77169,4
77169,I just want to wear tights with it because you can actually wear the back lifts up your butt.,77169,4
77170,This arrived way after my birthday so I didn't get to wear it.,77170,4
77170,"I am a 36 G and the top is way too small for me, my cups runneth over but the skirt is very cute.",77170,4
77170,I will be incorporating it into other outfits.,77170,4
77171,Cute and I do like it.,77171,4
77171,Snug fit in arms and I don't have big arms.,77171,4
77172,The chain is a bit short but that is okay because everything else about it is perfect,77172,4
77173,only downfall is you have to handwash them,77173,4
77174,Very pretty my sister loves it,77174,4
77175,"Great material, great fit, would have 5 stars if there were two more belt loops.",77175,4
77176,Very pretty and fits perfectly.,77176,4
77177,I thought it was made from a different material but it still fit nicely,77177,4
77178,"I love these boots, so comfy",77178,4
77179,"Love the shirt, issues with Paint sticking together.",77179,4
77180,Came quickly and they are exactly what I wanted,77180,4
77181,"I'm 5'8"" 150lbs, not really chunky and it fit me perfectly!",77181,4
77181,Anyone heavier/taller might have a harder time fitting and it might be a little baggy on anyone smaller,77181,4
77182,A little shorter than I thought,77182,4
77183,Looked great and my sister loved it as a gift.,77183,4
77183,Very nice quality and appealing to the eye.,77183,4
77184,"This necklace is nice, I am really enjoying this necklace.",77184,4
77185,I've gotten a lot of complements,77185,4
77188,Wife didn't really like the fit but its prolly just her...i wish i could fit in to it cuz i love the brand.,77188,4
77189,Nice fit but stretches fairly easily.,77189,4
77189,Appears to go back once washed but my sons feet end up with out the gripper part on the bottom as it stretches and can be dangerous when he runs.,77189,4
77189,"Also, after two or three washes, it seems to fade.",77189,4
77189,Not a big deal with pajamas but somewhat disappointing.,77189,4
77192,Colors are beautiful and fit is super flattering.,77192,4
77192,Gave four stars only because it runs a bit small I had to exchange it for a bigger size.,77192,4
77193,I was pleasantly surprised to see this is pretty similar to the photo.,77193,4
77193,"It could be longer, but it was not drastically short.",77193,4
77193,The material is light but this dress is great to just throw on or even wear as part of a costume.,77193,4
77194,got extra small and it was still a little large,77194,4
77195,It's a beautiful shirt and the fabric is very soft.,77195,4
77195,"It does, however, run large.",77195,4
77195,I would order at least one size smaller than normal.,77195,4
77197,I love this bag.,77197,4
77197,Tons of pockets on the outside.,77197,4
77197,The only thing it is missing is a pocket on the inside.,77197,4
77198,My favorite thing about these shoes are the double Velcro straps.,77198,4
77198,This keeps the shoe on.,77198,4
77198,"I am constantly losing one shoe because they slip off, not these.",77198,4
77198,I gave them four starts because they are pricey for a baby shoe but then again all Jordans are.,77198,4
77199,it changes color after couple weeks,77199,4
77200,"I love them, but there's a bit too long and too snug and I have very long and narrow feet.",77200,4
77201,I like how it fits and how it hangs on my wrist.,77201,4
77202,"After reading bad reviews, I was skeptical about this dress.",77202,4
77202,"When it arrived and I tried it on, it was perfect!",77202,4
77202,Wore it to my sisters baby shower.,77202,4
77202,One problem is that it wrinkles easy.,77202,4
77203,A little more yellow than white but the material is very nice and i'll keep them even though I can't use them for the wedding.,77203,4
77203,Very flowy and nice.,77203,4
77203,I got them as a gift and she already had the blouse which was very white and not a match for the color of the blouse at all.,77203,4
77204,i bought large size even my size is small that some people told its too small.,77204,4
77204,i would like to suggest just one size bigger than you is better.,77204,4
77205,"Turned out to be a great gift, fit just right, no shrinking.",77205,4
77207,I have this in black and am ordering the blue today.,77207,4
77207,Part of me wishes it was offered in 2x but ...,77207,4
77207,I do need to loose weight so this will fit a long time.,77207,4
77208,"Nice thick sweatshirt tunic, bought another for my 90-year-old Mom.",77208,4
77208,"Four stars only because the sleeves are a little short and I have short arms, but overall a good value and a lovely color.",77208,4
77209,Super cute but runs larger than expected.,77209,4
77210,a little on the small side but very nive,77210,4
77211,Look like very good gloves.,77211,4
77211,"However, I ripped off one of the plastic grippers from the wrist straps the very first time I tried tightening the gloves, which wasn't a pleasant feeling.",77211,4
77211,"The repair was simple since the gripper was designed to easily open and clamp down on the string, so its back in ideal shape.",77211,4
77211,The material and quality looks good otherwise and the gloves fit just right.,77211,4
77211,I would wish for a tad more freedom in being able to full outstretch the the pinky finger away from the thumb but shouldn't complain since it is a winter glove.,77211,4
77211,"The other tightening straps are kind of tough to tighten and the only way I could use them was tighten them with my hand out of the glove, which sort of defeats the purpose.",77211,4
77211,They are not too bulky and driving should be easy.,77211,4
77211,I have yet to test them out so if they keep my hands warm (main reason why I bought them) I'll update the review accordingly.,77211,4
77211,"However, ripping off the gripper was not a pleasant experience when you just dished out some money on what you thought were quality gloves.",77211,4
77212,It's a little long and may be worn as a dress depending where your going but the material feels good on your skin,77212,4
77213,These shoes were so beautiful as flower girl shoes.,77213,4
77213,My two daughters wore them.,77213,4
77213,"For one daughter, they have always been very comfortable.",77213,4
77213,"For my other daughter, after wearing them one time, she had bad blisters in between her toes and on her heels.",77213,4
77214,a little to thick,77214,4
77215,The product is excellent and easy to use.,77215,4
77216,Received many compliments... a tad tight,77216,4
77217,The material isn't as soft as I wouldn't hoped but it's nothing unexpected since the price is pretty low,77217,4
77218,My son loves it!,77218,4
77219,Fabric is thick and holds its shaoe well.,77219,4
77219,"Color is a little lighter than the picture, but still a pretty red.",77219,4
77219,Sizing and length was perfect.,77219,4
77220,"Sophisticated and seems like leather but material frays, like its recycled or something.",77220,4
77220,Nonetheless for the money it is worth it.,77220,4
77220,"Wish it was more honest about the material, when I went to finalize an order on the red version, I noticed in the description it says FAUX leather......?",77220,4
77221,I love this dress!!,77221,4
77221,The problem is that it fits a little smaller than expected AND it is made of a pretty heavy polyester blend so it does not work in the Southern South Carolina heat.,77221,4
77222,"Great money clip and looks awesome 
4 stars just because I think $5 less can be the perfect price",77222,4
77223,"I am 5'6"", 110 lbs, and a C cup.",77223,4
77223,I ordered the medium as suggested in many reviews.,77223,4
77223,The bottoms fit great with the good coverage and no pinching.,77223,4
77223,"The top cups fit great, but the band is far too large by about 4 inches.",77223,4
77223,I took it to a seamstress to adjust and now it's perfect.,77223,4
77224,If you are petite this might fit you a little big I'm 4'11 and 96 pounds and got a small that fit me a tad loose but it is still very cute to wear (:,77224,4
77225,The Pinnacle version of Powerstep is really comfortable.,77225,4
77225,"I also have the Powerstep Journey and while the Pinnacle doesn't have as much arch support, the do feel more comfortable when wearing them all day.",77225,4
77225,The one flaw with these insoles is the have a horrible squeak when I walk.,77225,4
77225,It's really noticeable when its quite or I'm in my house.,77225,4
77225,"When your out and about it's less noticeable because of background noise, but it's still there.",77225,4
77225,"The other versions of Powerstep do not squeak, so I think it's just the material of the Pinnacle version.",77225,4
77226,We got these for my 12 yr old's costume.,77226,4
77226,She likes the material.,77226,4
77226,"The fit is somewhat small, not sure if these are meant for a child and I missed that in the description.",77226,4
77226,I can't see an adult fitting in to these unless they have small hands.,77226,4
77226,The shipping was fast and the price was good so we're not complaining.,77226,4
77227,"I like the watch, except the hands should have been black.white on white is hard to see.",77227,4
77228,"Arrived on time, lovely bag happy with my purchase!",77228,4
77229,A bit large in Length but next up would have been too much.,77229,4
77229,Excellent on boat NON skid no kidding  very light weight,77229,4
77230,Loved it but a bit small,77230,4
77231,"A good wallet, however the buckle is a little crooked and some of the stitching is off and crooked as well.",77231,4
77232,"Top a little big, but luv it!",77232,4
77233,Suspenders are just as described.,77233,4
77233,Picture is accurate as to color.,77233,4
77234,This is an excellent item.,77234,4
77234,"Before, I never seemed to have my reading glasses when I needed them.",77234,4
77234,"Now, I always do.",77234,4
77234,Wish I had thought it up.,77234,4
77234,"FYI, the case for the phone is just okay.",77234,4
77234,(Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5) I would recommend buying the product as just the glasses and stick on pouch and place it on your favorite case.,77234,4
77235,Material appears to be durable.,77235,4
77236,A little sm but can wear it I'm 5'10 125 lb,77236,4
77238,"Good quality, looks nice, good price.",77238,4
77239,It was too tight though.,77239,4
77240,These pajamas would be 5 stars except the title is misleading.,77240,4
77240,My 4 year old daughter wanted some new summer-weight astronaut pajamas so we hopped on Amazon together and searched for astronaut pajamas.,77240,4
77240,"These looked good but it says ""Baby Boys 2015 Footed Sleeper Pajama"", so I told her we would have to get them for her brother instead.",77240,4
77240,She was so mad and disappointed that I couldn't find any girls astronaut pajamas.,77240,4
77240,"Anyway, when they arrived for my son two days later, I was pretty mad that I didn't get what was advertised.",77240,4
77240,The Amazon listing clearly say BOYS pajamas so I expected a place for a penis to go - maybe a little built-in jockstrap or something.,77240,4
77240,"I don't know - I'm not a man so I have no idea how these things works, I just figured there had to be some difference because otherwise wouldn't it just say ""Baby 2015 Footed Sleeper Pajama""?",77240,4
77240,"Since these pajamas were clearly NOT BOYS' pajamas, I gave them to my daughter instead.",77240,4
77240,"(Incidentally, she informed me that half of NASA's astronaut latest class is 50% female.)",77240,4
77240,These are in fact lightweight - perfect for summer.,77240,4
77240,They seem to run somewhat small - I thought they'd be a little big on her but instead I think she'll outgrow them in a couple months.,77240,4
77240,Smaller than Carter's PJs.,77240,4
77240,"The fabric gets stretched out easily around the knees and other places she bends, and it looks much lighter in color when it's stretched out.",77240,4
77240,But my budding astronaut doesn't mind one bit.,77240,4
77240,"And as long as she's happy with them, I'm happy.",77240,4
77241,"Nice handbag, however it was larger than  it appeared in picture.",77241,4
77242,"This shirt is pretty, and nice.",77242,4
77242,"It WOULD get a rave and 5 stars, except for a couple of things.",77242,4
77242,The material is very cheap.,77242,4
77242,We're talkin' basic bed linen from a hotel.,77242,4
77242,I can see it ripping easily.,77242,4
77242,I've gotten other tops from Roaman's that are just better quality overall.,77242,4
77242,It runs VERY large.,77242,4
77242,I am usually an 18--I ordered a 16 and it's still a bit roomy.,77242,4
77242,"Nevertheless, it's a really cute top!",77242,4
77242,I love the sleeves in particular.,77242,4
77243,Well made and beautiful detail with the peacock applique' on the front.,77243,4
77243,The skirt under the two layers of tulle isn't quite as full as seen in the product image.,77243,4
77243,We thought it would be a bit fuller and pouffier.,77243,4
77243,But with the two layers of tulle it is still a lovely dress and perfect for the masquerade event to which it was worn.,77243,4
77243,The dress comes packaged in a small-ish box so leave yourself plenty of time to steam/iron out wrinkles in the tulle.,77243,4
77243,The top of the dress was in perfect condition and did not need ironing.,77243,4
77245,i liked this but trying to find the color for the pants  no can do,77245,4
77246,They were as advertised and arrived sooner than expected,77246,4
77247,My rose trinket box is beautiful!,77247,4
77247,The only thing is that one of the leaves was broken when I received it.,77247,4
77248,"This is nice, was a little tighter then expected.",77248,4
77249,"Very good quality product, but the size is not even close to what I wear.",77249,4
77249,It is too small.,77249,4
77249,"I tried to ask question ( online) how to choose the size but response was absolutely useless, the customer care person didn't have any idea about it so I have to guess and order another one on my own risk.",77249,4
77250,I do water aerobics and it is easy to exercise in.,77250,4
77250,Will update with how it wears in chlorinated pools.,77250,4
77250,"I had searched for chlorine resistant swimwear and this product came up, hoping it wears well.",77250,4
77250,"Note:  color fades faster than I had  hoped,  doesn't hold up well in chlorinated pools.",77250,4
77251,Product arrived as described/pictured.,77251,4
77251,"Dressed had been washed once, did not shrink and looks great.",77251,4
77252,"Lovely dress, very feminine, couldn't have been prettier or made better, but the XXL fit a friend that wears a 10, perfectly.",77252,4
77253,"This is a beautiful dress, it fits perfectly; got a lot of compliments",77253,4
77254,This shirt runs small.,77254,4
77254,I will recommend to buy one size up.,77254,4
77256,I love this ring!,77256,4
77256,"The only down side was a slightly raised link that I catch when I am spinning it, lol.",77256,4
77256,I took some small plyers to it and was able to push it down.,77256,4
77257,a very nice piece to look at and wear,77257,4
77258,Love how dark they are but a bit wide for my face.,77258,4
77259,Just right for a teen.,77259,4
77260,It's a great rompers for the price.,77260,4
77261,Beautiful decorates well w one on each end.,77261,4
77261,After 14 days one of the jewels fell out..shipping back and getting a refund.,77261,4
77261,Have already ordered another.,77261,4
77261,I will just touch each jewel w a lil glue.,77261,4
77261,No other charms like them..,77261,4
77262,These are great for yoga or even for people who might be at risk for a fall.,77262,4
77262,They have great traction on the bottom but it does take some getting used to with putting your toes into the little toes holes.,77262,4
77265,This is a really cute top and it's flattering to figure.,77265,4
77265,Yes I would purchase again in another color,77265,4
77266,I like this pin but I wish the clasp could hold the pin in place tighter against my lapels.,77266,4
77266,This pins keeps spinning around.,77266,4
77267,"A little wide, but it works.",77267,4
77268,originally my prom dress i ended up giving to my sister because it was a little too small for me.,77268,4
77269,Even though it's wicked cute the cuts on the hips are high.,77269,4
77269,The fabric isn't thick enough for it to get wet but I'm sure if you wear it under something no problem.,77269,4
77270,"I do love it, even though it's a little big, and got many compliments",77270,4
77271,I usually wear a 36 but thanks to another review saw I should get 38.,77271,4
77271,Shorts fit great and lay just at the middle of my knee.,77271,4
77271,Better than my old cargo shorts that went down to the middle of my shins (not quite that far) my wife says.,77271,4
77272,"Not disappointed or anything, the bead on the bottom is just much larger than I anticipated.",77272,4
77273,Good material  glad i took a chance & bought a few colors for my trip,77273,4
77274,I got this as a part of a Dio de los muertos sugar skull costume for my daughter.,77274,4
77274,The place detail is lovely and well made or the price.,77274,4
77274,"We got a large, which was perfect for her, bit it does run a bit small.",77274,4
77274,"I also wouldn't put it in the dryer, but for the price this was to be expected.",77274,4
77274,"When she is done with the costume she will still wear the top, she likes it that much.",77274,4
77275,"Fit a bit looser than I expected, but it isn't bad.",77275,4
77275,I normally wear a xsmall,77275,4
77276,"Very cute, but was too small....determined up lose lbs so will not send back.",77276,4
77276,Keep in mind it's sheet,77276,4
77277,Exactly like the picture and all.,77277,4
77277,"It came torn, but hot glue can easily fix it although.",77277,4
77278,Not over sized like I needed,77278,4
77279,The dress fit very nicely and it's a good quality.,77279,4

77280,I got a large and I'm a 36 C with a short torso.,77280,4
77280,The print is pretty solid and doesn't distort or stretch out even with my tig ole bitties.,77280,4

77281,large in the top,77281,4
77282,"the shirt material is pretty thin, but it is soft and fits pretty accurately!",77282,4
77283,just what I was looking for perfect for my sweetie and I we recently reconciled after over 20 yrs apart and wanted something to symbolize our getting back together.,77283,4

77286,"Nice shape, could be darker but works.",77286,4
77287,Just got this purse and I love it!,77287,4
77287,The only thing that disappoints me is if you have never owned a painted leather purse before you don't know how to care for it.,77287,4
77287,They should have a link on the page to buy a color leather protector.,77287,4
77287,I did not know I needed it until I opened my package.,77287,4
77287,I see color coming off my beautiful purse because I was not informed at time of purchase.,77287,4
77287,"Hopefully the protector I ordered will
get here before I lose even more color.",77287,4
77288,I'm only 5'2 so I will have to hem it.,77288,4
77288,But it's very flattering to my figure.,77288,4
77289,I'd give these 5 stars except that they fit way too large.,77289,4
77289,"I'm 5'9"" 175 lbs and normally wear medium shorts or 32-33 waist shorts.",77289,4
77289,I originally ordered the mediums and they were too big.,77289,4
77289,"I returned them and ordered smalls, and they fit, but even the smalls are a little loose in the waist.",77289,4
77289,If these shorts had a draw string that you could really tighten the shorts with then they'd be perfect.,77289,4
77289,Love Deadpool and these shorts are well made and look cool!,77289,4
77290,"Very nice product, just need larger size",77290,4
77291,A little snug on the 1st wearing.,77291,4
77291,Still this is a great buy.,77291,4
77291,"I usually buy only white briefs, these come in 3 differant  colors and I like the colors.",77291,4
77292,"I love this, i wore this over over my 2 piece bathing suit.",77292,4
77292,i think i ordered a 3xl and i am a size 16,77292,4
77293,Shirt is nice looking!,77293,4
77293,"Love the material, very soft (but thin).",77293,4
77293,It was a bigger than most clothes of the same size.,77293,4
77295,Live the dress I will have to alter it,77295,4
77296,"Nice shoe, just didn't like the extra glue on them",77296,4
77297,Very nice n soft,77297,4
77298,Goes with a lot of different things and I always receive compliments.,77298,4
77298,"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the material is somewhat cheap, I had a hole in the armpit where the stitching is after only one wear.",77298,4
77298,However it's an easy fix,77298,4
77299,It is fitted at the hips.,77299,4
77299,"I wear a size 10 dress, but 6-8 top.",77299,4
77299,"Loved it still, but was expecting more of a tunic.",77299,4
77300,It did break a few days after I gave it to my daughter but I was easily able to fix it.,77300,4
77300,(The chain became disconnected at the end near the clasp.,77300,4
77300,I do not care for the chain.,77300,4
77300,If the chain gets folded and then pulled it will break easily.,77300,4
77301,I only shorted this product one star down to 4 because the sizing runs really small.,77301,4
77301,I took note from the previous reviews and ordered extra large.,77301,4
77301,I usually wear large in gloves and the extra large is snug.,77301,4
77301,Good quality at a fair price.,77301,4
77302,For a picatinny mount only does not fit a weaver rail pattern.,77302,4
77303,"Nice length, cute, light vest/shrug.",77303,4
77304,"Only one complaint, arrived with small dents, but otherwise good hat.",77304,4
77305,"I ordered the charcoal, white, and black.",77305,4
77305,They were great except that the black one had a line of holes down the back.,77305,4
77305,I returned the black because of the holes but the charcoal and white are great!,77305,4
77306,I love tge purse.,77306,4
77306,"I would have given it 5 stars, but it has a horrible smell inside the purse.",77306,4
77306,"I am using orange peels inside of it, hoping the smell goes away.",77306,4
77307,I love the style and get compliments all the time.,77307,4
77307,"They appear to be good quality, although they did seem to scratch easily (the reason I gave 4 stars and not 5) Still worth the price!",77307,4
77308,ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT IT SINCE SHIPPING CAME FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY.,77308,4
77309,Sizing is a little off..,77309,4
77309,I suggest sizing up for your littles to wear.,77309,4
77310,I really like the look and the fit.,77310,4
77310,The length makes it an all occasion dress.,77310,4
77312,I like the looks of it very much!,77312,4
77312,But when the handle is up it falls over.,77312,4
77313,"The hole is not the part that sizes, the sizer is at the end of the hole.",77313,4
77313,Just keep in mind how it works when purchasing.,77313,4
77315,Color is more crimson than maroon.,77315,4
77315,I had purchased for an event at Texas A&M and the color wasn't maroon enough.,77315,4
77315,"I loved the fit and the style, so kept it for another event, but needed to purchase another outfit for the original purpose.",77315,4
77316,"I liked the material and the garment but it was too small for me so I give it to my little bro,",77316,4
77317,"Great alternative to very pricey hanky panky, although they fit slightly different.",77317,4
77317,"Comfy, good value for money.",77317,4
77318,Buy two sizes up as advised by others and fits well.,77318,4
77318,"My daughter is a 34B I got a 36C....should have gotton a 36B, which would have been perfect.",77318,4
77319,"Love the price and quality, but delivery took over a month!",77319,4
77319,Way to long to wait.,77319,4
77320,"I'm not  sure what the advantage is of having ""PASSPORT"" stamped on the front is, letting anyone in the area know what it holds.",77320,4
77321,I wish I'd gone up to the 4T even though he just turned 3.,77321,4
77321,The 2T/3T combo just isn't true to size.,77321,4
77321,4T pants would drown the kid.,77321,4
77322,I love the neon greenish costume.,77322,4
77322,"The small size fit perfectly on my 5'3"" 112 lb frame.",77322,4
77322,Cant wait to wear it on Halloween at my daughters elementary school.,77322,4
77325,It was a gift for my cousin.,77325,4
77325,"He loves it, and it would get a 5 star rating  but there are some cons.",77325,4
77325,1) it came only in a bag with no instructions.,77325,4
77325,I had to fiddle with all of the buttons to change the settings.,77325,4
77325,"2)it's  on military time, which is okay since it has both digital and analog time.",77325,4
77325,There doesn't seem to be a way to remove this function though.,77325,4
77325,But he doesn't  mind so much.,77325,4
77325,These two things would garner a full 5 stars.,77325,4
77325,"But it's fine, ju st small details.",77325,4
77325,We haven't  tested the waterproof feature just yet.....which  is good (he isn't a ware so if he did he might just dunk his arm in water....don't want that happening.),77325,4
77325,"Overall, it's an okay watch.",77325,4
77325,He adores  it.,77325,4
77326,Very good quality brand.,77326,4
77327,My husband loves it.,77327,4
77328,I love the skirt but the size is smaller than the normal size.,77328,4
77329,The boob area was a bit big but I adjusted it to fit my frame.,77329,4
77330,This is a great shirt that combines two of my favorite characters together  (Indiana Jones and Walter White).,77330,4
77330,"It helps I'd you read the text on the shirt in your ""cheesiest"" 1980's movie trailer anouncer voice to get the full experience!",77330,4
77331,I'm a 32 D and I ordered a small/medium.,77331,4
77331,Fits great once I carefully pull it over my head.,77331,4
77331,I gave it four stars because I'm a brat and wanted the white color.,77331,4
77331,But it wasn't offered in prime.,77331,4
77331,And It wasn't as fragile as I thought.,77331,4
77331,It lasted great coming off and on again (my bf and I were rolling.),77331,4
77331,My first buy from this brand and I'm satisfied.,77331,4
77332,"It fit perfectly, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it did not have snaps in the crotch and I had to be creative using the bathroom.",77332,4
77332,Thank god I ordered a size up so I was able to pull it to the side.,77332,4
77333,Nice dress buy one size up for better fit,77333,4
77334,"very nice, just doesnt lay correctly on my ears",77334,4
77335,Like others have said this ring is very shiny.,77335,4
77335,It's a bit thicker than I expected but it's still perfect.,77335,4
77336,Looks good and is fairly compact.,77336,4
77336,Plenty of slots for credit cards.,77336,4
77336,Only down side is that you have to fold bills in third to fit inside so you can't fit more than four bills in and still get it closed.,77336,4
77337,"The quality is amazing, but is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, a lot.",77337,4
77337,I was so unhappy with it that I gave it to my sister.,77337,4
77337,"It just wasn't suited for me personally, but it's a beautiful and high quality piece of body jewelry.",77337,4
77338,I bought these glassed because they reminded me of glasses I had back in the 80's.,77338,4
77338,For the price they are not bad.,77338,4
77339,"Cute but definitely too small, large fits like a small/med",77339,4
77340,"These pants are a tad on the small side, and the fabric is fairly thin, but my daughter loves them - the colors are bright, and the fabric is soft and comfortable.",77340,4
77340,I'd order a size up on these as they seem to run a little bit small.,77340,4
77340,"My main concern is how long they will last since the fabric feels so thin, but we've already washed them at least 10 times over the last couple months, and my daughter plays hard in preschool with them, and no holes or issues yet.",77340,4
77340,The leggings are ruched a bit at the bottom which is a nice touch - it makes it easier to order larger sizes since the ruching keeps any extra length in the legs from dragging on the floor.,77340,4
77340,"On the whole, recommended, though the thin fabric is best suited for fall and spring (not a cold winter), and might not last as long as a thicker style legging.",77340,4

77342,"Love the design, but runs large.",77342,4
77344,It fits small in the shoulders and is very long,77344,4
77346,"I have a longer torso fo height wise it fits snug, other than that comfy.",77346,4

77356,Nice selection and fun!,77356,4

77361,Fit great and looked good.,77361,4
77361,My only complaint is that the bow tie seemed a little small.,77361,4
77362,Some of the socks have less stretch than others (making them tough to don without straining the fabric).,77362,4
77362,"The designs are fun, though, and they seem to be of at least average quality.",77362,4
77363,Using as coverup for bathing suit.,77363,4
77363,"Only complaint, no washing instructions included.",77363,4

77364,"It is cute with a jacket or belt, but comes off a little like a muu muu by itself.",77364,4
77365,These leggings are so cute and high waisted but I got a xxl since I wasn't sure if this was Asian sizes and I am usually a 10/12 but that was waaayyy too big.,77365,4

Cons:
-it smells like really strong plastic, when I opened it my head started hurting because of the smell
-idk there's this thing that won't come off of the plastic, like a fur type thing?",77371,4
77371,It's not really noticeable so whatever.,77371,4
77371,"But I'd rate this 9/10 hyungwon memes, minus one because of the plastic smell, I don't know how to get rid of it",77371,4
77372,Not bad darker than the pic tho,77372,4
77373,I like me an my daughter,77373,4
77374,Good product but bad stitching and unstable clip.,77374,4
77374,Had to send it to get re-stitched.,77374,4
77375,Excellent bill and card holder.,77375,4
77375,"If you carry lots of changes, this is not for you.",77375,4

77379,"This is a beautiful, soft, luxurious, and comfortable robe.",77379,4
77379,"For the price, you can't beat it.",77379,4
77379,"It fits well, has two functional pockets, and stays tied around your waist.",77379,4
77379,My only complaint is that the robe is much shorter than I expected.,77379,4
77379,I am about 5 feet 4 inches and this robe is above my knees.,77379,4
77379,While this makes for a great summer robe I personally prefer a longer robe that I can wear all winter.,77379,4
77379,Overall his is a very nice and good quality robe.,77379,4
77380,"My wife bought this to wear to her baby shower and she said she loved it, but the material is a little thin and could be slightly see through.",77380,4
77381,kind of bulky im a small person and even this is to bulky in a not so cute way,77381,4
77382,Arrived on time fit as expected just in time and they match my purse.,77382,4
77384,These are wonderful shoes.,77384,4
77384,The fit is a little small so I would chose your size carefully.,77384,4
77384,The colour was not quite the same as the pictures on Amazon.,77384,4
77384,The colour is gorgeous but more like coral or salmon.,77384,4
77387,Well I m a bit sad ....,77387,4
77387,The material is good y very stretchy but the problem is the bottom of the dress is not like The picture,77387,4
77388,It great for going out dancing.,77388,4

77393,"With some extra cardio, I was able to wear it",77393,4
77394,they are what I wanted and I will order more...,77394,4
77395,"I didn't realize you have to tie the shoelaces, which would be difficult for my 4 year old.",77395,4
77395,"From the photos, it looks like there is no need to tie them.",77395,4
77395,Maybe I can find a way to tie it snug enough for my daughter to take her boots on and off at preschool.,77395,4

77411,this is a great product,77411,4
77412,"Because of the small heel, it provides a little support.",77412,4
77412,It is a very cute flat with lots of bling.,77412,4

77452,"Even thoughost this kind of wallet is designed for cards, having a few emergency bills is helpful.",77452,4
77452,Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because the black model is very prone to scratches and scuffs which are distracting to the the overall beauty of the build.,77452,4

77464,I'm currently 8 months pregnant and my baby might be on a little big according to my doc.,77464,4
77464,So I wanted to be safe than sorry.,77464,4
77464,I think it will probably fit a preemie rather well.,77464,4
77465,Nice and soft but its a little short.. And my wife isn't a tall woman.. She is only 5'2,77465,4
77466,Lovely pendant it really stands out.,77466,4

77484,Very pretty but I thought it would be larger.,77484,4
77486,I went with a 12 at first then exchanged it for a 14.,77486,4
77486,I have a hard time with sizing because my chest always bumps me up a size or two.,77486,4
77486,The 12 was too tight and the 14 was too loose.,77486,4
77486,The dress is really lovely and well made.,77486,4
77486,I was disappointed that it just didn't work for me.,77486,4
77486,Expect a lot of poof in the skirt but the tulle could easily be altered if wanted.,77486,4
77486,Their customer service was fantastic and returning was hassle free.,77486,4
77487,"The quality and the style is great, however, the product is overpriced...",77487,4

77493,"It was for my daughter, she is very skinny but I got the size XL for her because I read the Asian sizes come smaller.",77493,4
77493,XL was perfect for a skinny tall girl.,77493,4
77493,"I can't tell if this product is the original because didn't come with any tag, that makes me think it's not the original it's just a copy of the brand one.",77493,4
77493,Shipping was ok in between a moderate time.,77493,4
77493,Consider that this was shipped from china.,77493,4
77494,Order a size up and be careful when you wash it.,77494,4
77494,Design is as described and of good quality.,77494,4

77496,Not as pretty as the picture.,77496,4
77496,Very muted and most of the colors blend together.,77496,4
77496,But its still nice.,77496,4
77497,"I am 5'3"" and the it is a little bit high on my backside but overall this is a great product and made well considering the price.",77497,4

77498,"I am 5'9"" and 120 pounds and it was almost like a longer shirt.",77498,4
77498,I recommend buying a size or two larger than regular wear.,77498,4
77498,"The dress looks just like the picture though, super soft, and very flexible, I LOVE IT!",77498,4
77499,"This dress is very sheer so be aware of what you wear underneath, I purchased the light mocha.",77499,4
77499,I bought the large because i'm in my 3rd trimester and my boobs&tummy are getting huge it's stretchy so plenty of room to grow!,77499,4
77499,"I'm also 5'8 so the dress does not go as long as I would like, it reaches my ankles.",77499,4
77499,I may buy another color unless I can find something longer.,77499,4
77499,"Also, someone commented about the smell.",77499,4
77499,"You should always wash items when you buy them from anywhere, and the smell went away with the first wash.",77499,4

77500,"It's $10, don't expect top quality but it's not all that bad!",77500,4
77500,"The top is lined, which was unexpected and great.",77500,4
77500,"Ordered the large and it is very baggy in the midsection, and I do not have an hourglass shape in the least.",77500,4
77500,I'd suggest order your regular size if you're on the fence!,77500,4
77501,Frame seems a little flimsy but I didn't expect much from a $12 pair.,77501,4
77501,It's super cute and I've gotten a lot of compliments already!,77501,4
77502,Good product if you don't want to tear up your socks.,77502,4

77509,But the cats still win me over.,77509,4
77510,"However, the pearl is not a real pearl.",77510,4
77510,I took mine apart and put in a real pearl.,77510,4
77510,"You must be very careful with it though, the wings will break.",77510,4
77510,"I ordered more wings and another bracelet, just because I know the wings WILL break.",77510,4

77516,I bought this for a sleep shirt and it is great for that purpose.,77516,4
77516,I have actually bought a second!,77516,4
77517,"I love them, everyone at my work likes them.",77517,4
77517,They are a little on the tighter side at first but do stretch out.,77517,4
77517,They also when washing some of the colors do blend and leave marks on the socks just because there are so many colors being washed at once.,77517,4
77517,But it isn't a big deal and I'd buy again.,77517,4
77518,"Very nice hat, great fabric and fit, just ordered another one in black.",77518,4
77519,I ordered up a size and it fits but it fits weird.,77519,4

77520,"Great quality, case does get scatched easily",77520,4
77521,"The dress is absolutely stunning in person, and looks exactly as it is pictured!",77521,4
77521,"However, practical elements does bring the rating down.",77521,4
77521,"The seller says that they will customize the dress, but when we finally received it, not only was it very obvious that the dress was not customized to the measurements we sent, but it was 2 sizes too large.",77521,4
77521,We had to spend over $100 to have the dress altered.,77521,4
77521,"The lacing for the corseted bodice was also very flimsy, and required replacement.",77521,4
77521,"Another thing of note, the corset lacing in the back of the bodice is not ornamental, it is functional.",77521,4
77521,"There are no hooks or zippers in the back to tighten the bodice (we had to ask the seamstress to add some), the only way to do that is by tightening the lacing in the back.",77521,4
77521,"Once the dress was altered and  the ribbon replaced, the dress was a showstopper.",77521,4
77521,I just don't care for a seller to promote a service that isn't actually offered.,77521,4
77522,I ordered up a size just in case.,77522,4
77522,But that wasn't necessary.,77522,4
77522,Although going up a size does give it more flow.,77522,4

77524,I used them when I went skiing this past weekend in Tahoe.,77524,4
77524,They have a very pretty design and they kept my hands dry.,77524,4
77524,"The only reason i'm giving it four stars, is because the hand entry is a little snug and the fingertips seem to be a little longer then they need to be.",77524,4
77525,"Umbrellas did have some dust or something on the plastic that make them look dirty, but it seems to wipe off.",77525,4
77526,This tee runs a little small you should size up one or two sizes depending on your bust size.,77526,4
77527,I like that the visor has a wide brim but the back strap does not accommodate my head.,77527,4
77527,I have trouble making the hat fit correctly .,77527,4
77527,The hat adjustment does not accommodate my head very well it is too small.,77527,4
77527,I would say this hat is one size fits most but not all.,77527,4
77527,Overall this hat would have gotten a higher rating if I could get it to fit.,77527,4
77527,I gave this hat to my teenage sister she seems to fit in it much better.,77527,4
77528,"I really love this suit, I'm a little on the chubby side with a rather large chest.",77528,4
77528,I'd say the top just manages to keep everything in place but the bottom is wonderful.,77528,4
77528,"Maybe not suited to more adventurous swimming, but great for everyday use.",77528,4
77529,"I'm a petite 5'1, 120# pear shape individual and the small fit perfect.",77529,4
77529,Good length for me for wearing with leggings.,77529,4
77529,Not great quality (it's thin and I can't imagine it holding up well!),77529,4
77529,"but I am only getting it for one mermaid-based event, not for longevity, and it will do just fine for that!",77529,4
77530,Love these earrings but would like a backing so they don't slip off.,77530,4
77531,I may have needed a size bigger but still very flattering and great quality shirt.,77531,4
77534,Fits perfectly and I love the feel of the material.,77534,4
77535,Nice weight and pretty.,77535,4
77535,Holds hair pretty well.,77535,4
77535,Only con is the dangly pearls are a little fragile so you have to be careful not to pull them.,77535,4
77536,I do like the tank a lot although the fit is much smaller than other size small tanks.,77536,4
77536,There isn't much give at all.,77536,4

77539,You would have to cut/hem them.,77539,4
77539,"I'm 5'6"" and there's about 6"" of extra hem.",77539,4
77540,I bought this for my wife.,77540,4
77540,"She said that it is very warm, but fits a bit tighter than she would prefer.",77540,4
77541,It's a little larger/longer than I would have liked but it's a very cute top.,77541,4
77541,I would recommend ordering a size down from the product recommendation.,77541,4
77543,The frame feels stiff compared to the similar styled Oakley's but for the price they compare very well!,77543,4
77543,The polarization is satisfactory and they fit snug to my face once the frame is situated a little.,77543,4
77543,I bought them for paddle boarding and playing in a men's softball league.,77543,4
77543,I love that they look like Oakley's but cost a few bucks so if they're lost or destroyed I can easily replace them.,77543,4
77544,Good quality shirt and nice color.,77544,4
77544,Not sure why it says purple it is pink.,77544,4

77546,I ordered two sizes  larger than I thought that I would need.,77546,4
77546,Overall it looks amazing I am so excited  to wear it.,77546,4
77546,It does cut pretty high on the butt but its not a bad thing its just different than I am used to.,77546,4
77546,It descises the scars I have on my stomach which I was really excited.,77546,4
77546,I took a huge risk ordering online but I am glad that I did it was either this or a high waisted bikini.,77546,4
77546,I would order it again.,77546,4
77548,The belt is just the right size and is holding up well.,77548,4
77549,"This dress is lovely, looks better in person than in this photo.",77549,4
77549,Fabric is a bit thin so need to wear an undershirt.,77549,4
77549,"Only issue with it was the sewing quality, the dress's seams didn't line up infact it was off by more than a half inch.",77549,4
77550,Fits alittle small in the bust.,77550,4
77550,But cute shirt love it,77550,4
77551,I ordered XS and i am 118lb and 5' tall but it was a little tight on my waist but very happy for a costume quality,77551,4
77552,Pretty dress but top is snug,77552,4
77553,"These nose rings are honestly beautiful, I bought around 9 and they are all the same, the shipping was sooner than expected, and the gen was prettier than expected, I ordered so many because I thought they would make beautiful Christmas presents for me and my friends, and they all seem to love theirs also, they are also adjustable, thankfully, because when I received it it was a bit large to stay on my nose comfortably and I just had to pinch it slightly and it fits perfectly!",77553,4
77554,"A bit thin, but I love this wig so much",77554,4
77557,They fit great and were not see thru.,77557,4
77558,These are very pretty got them for Easter.,77558,4
77558,The shoulder straps could b made more sturdy but I like them for my grand daughter plus they were not over priced,77558,4

77559,Dark brown that I received is not as dark as in photo.,77559,4
77560,I bought 2 different dresses from this seller.,77560,4
77560,"Both size small, one fits great this one is too small.",77560,4
77560,buy one size larger if ordering this dress the fabric does not stretch.,77560,4
77560,Very disappointed after waiting a month for delivery!,77560,4
77561,The quality matches the price and the color is true to the picture -- a pearly white with vibrant colors.,77561,4
77561,"If you are at the higher end of the one-size fits all, definitely go for the XLG version.",77561,4
77561,I am a 10-12 usually (wide hips) and it fits but it does not flare as much.,77561,4
77561,The way this skirt accommodates several sizes in one is that the back part of the waist band is elastic.,77561,4
77561,"The elastic is soft so it is not an uncomfortable fit...however, if you have a small waist it may feel a little loose due to the soft elastic.",77561,4
77561,Will definitely keep...and I agree with the other reviews.,77561,4
77561,It arrives wrinkled but is not iron friendly...,77561,4
77561,I just used steam.,77561,4
77561,Took a while but it was worth it.,77561,4
77563,"Nice rich red color, not tomato red, not raspberry, a ""true red"" if you will.",77563,4

77563,"Nice, curvy fit without the sausage casing feel.",77563,4
77563,";)  Good length; below the knee on me (5'5"")",77563,4
77564,This bralette is super cute!,77564,4
77564,"It's simple so it layers well under almost anything, and looks pretty much as pictured - the front is more straight across for me than sweetheart.",77564,4
77564,"I'm a 30E/32DD and the bralette fit well, was somewhat supportive, and gave a flattering shape.",77564,4
77564,"The pads inside make it so nothing shows through, and you can move them if you want.",77564,4
77564,"It's definitely not a crop top unless you are an A cup or less, so I've never worn it by itself.",77564,4
77564,"You can see the stitching on the straps, so don't get it if that'll annoy you, but it's a $9 bralette that'll get to you in 2 days, so I think it was worth the price.",77564,4
77564,"I've had it for 9 months and it fits the same as when I got it - I wash it with the rest of my clothes, but I always hang dry it.",77564,4
77565,Order one size up.,77565,4
77565,I wear Chinese small always but this was a bit snug.,77565,4
77565,The customer service was excellent though so I'm editing my review and give four stars.,77565,4
77566,I would order a size bigger than what's recommended,77566,4
77567,"The lining makes it very warm, but in turn, makes it somewhat small.",77567,4
77567,Otherwise it is very nice!,77567,4
77568,"Other than that, we're satisfied.",77568,4
77569,"By the time it got to me, some stones were missing.",77569,4
77569,It was not packaged very well.,77569,4
77569,It's very pretty; but I can only suggest wearing it for a short time and wash it to avoid oil and dirt setting on it.,77569,4
77569,Not quite sure of the material.,77569,4
77569,"But, ""long lasting, great quality"" aren't my first choice of words to describe the craftsmanship.",77569,4
77569,"Again,
Once or twice for a special, yes.",77569,4
77569,"But, definitely not a set that I would recommend to someone with sensitive skin.",77569,4
77570,It was a gift for my husband.,77570,4
77570,It came on time and was great!,77570,4

77571,"Looks great, no boning so its very comfortable for all day wear.",77571,4
77571,Soft enough that you can wear it without another shirt underneath.,77571,4
77572,They were nice gloves but a little on the thiner side.,77572,4
77573,"It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, but that is only because I didn't look at the dimensions.",77573,4
77573,"When I received it, I went back and looked at the listed dimensions and they match.",77573,4
77573,"It is a scale replica, but it is exactly like pictured.",77573,4
77574,I find that the shirts run a little bit small.,77574,4
77574,When I order the next size up it simply does not feel right.,77574,4
77575,Has plenty of room for hair of any length to fit in.,77575,4
77576,"I am size 4 to 6 in a dress, 36b on top and size 8 on bottom, and this fits perfect.",77576,4
77576,The skirt is a sheerer material so you will definitely have to wear a slip.,77576,4
77576,Also it is pretty long.,77576,4
77576,"I am 5'8"" and it is long enough I can wear heels with it.",77576,4
77576,For the price this is a great dress.,77576,4
77577,Fabric is very wrinkly and the neck is kind of weird since this is not thick fabric.,77577,4
77577,Color is cute and it has a little texture which is fun.,77577,4
77578,"Nice, sturdy case built for credit card use.",77578,4
77578,"It , unfortunately, is unable to accommodate business cards",77578,4
77579,"Very small, ordered a medium and I'd say it was more like an extra small.",77579,4
77579,"It was a nice shirt, would have been happy with it if I would have ordered an extra large.",77579,4
77581,They are very comfortable and stylish but they are a little big on me,77581,4
77582,I bought this dress in red and it's absolutely gorgeous!,77582,4
77582,You can wear it casually or dress it up as well.,77582,4
77582,You won't be disappointed with this purchase.,77582,4
77583,I'm 5'7 with 160 pounds big breast with curves I order a M (did not fit) then a large it was much better but Breast area was too tight.,77583,4
77583,"This dress is very nice, however it must be for a smaller person with small breat.",77583,4
77583,I fell in love with the material tho.,77583,4
77584,The dress is pretty.,77584,4
77584,It's very tight under the arms and the material underneath the dress shows a little in the front.,77584,4

77592,Color and size as expected.,77592,4
77593,Great for office and occasion.,77593,4
77594,The fabric is a little stretchy but I did have issues with the hem of the dress.,77594,4
77595,Very nice but the top front layer is not cut as pictured.,77595,4

77598,"Great Shirt, I had to order xxl due to the other reviews for the this shirt stating that this runs two sizes smaller.",77598,4
77598,The xxl shirt fits like a US Large.,77598,4
77598,The sleeves look like they are form fitting in the product photo and are a little bit too loose for my taste.,77598,4
77598,But overall it's a great shirt.,77598,4
77598,got tons of compliments on it.,77598,4
77600,"I liked this shaper; however, I think it runs a little small.",77600,4
77600,I would definitely order the next size up.,77600,4
77600,"So, if you typically wear a medium, get a large.",77600,4
77600,I really like the lacy bottom feature and also like that it doesn't make me feel like I am wearing my grandmothers girdle.,77600,4
77600,"I would recommend this product, just remember it runs somewhat on the small side.",77600,4
77601,Material was smooth to the touch.,77601,4
77601,"After a few washes, the clothing has not deteriorated.",77601,4
77601,The design somewhat faded but that could of been due to washing style.,77601,4
77601,The boxer shorts are so cute on my son.,77601,4
77602,My daughter used this through her pregnancy and really liked it.,77602,4
77603,"Sturdy, very nice looking.",77603,4
77604,"I really liked this dress, which is why I emailed the company in advance to order a customize size after reading other reviews.",77604,4
77604,I got no reply from the company but included my measurements and order number in the message.,77604,4
77604,"I received the dress about three days later, which is awesome, but also means they just sent me the standard size 10, usually I wear 8 (150lbs 5,5"").",77604,4
77604,"The detailing of the dress was gorgeous and I really wanted to love this dress, but after a lot of effort to get the zipper up I could literally not breathe.",77604,4
77604,"Having kept dresses in the past with this scenario I find I avoid wearing them because of the discomfort, so I decided to send it back.",77604,4
77604,"The material seemed really nice, and well made, but I would recommend emailing the company for a customize size before making any kind of purchase.",77604,4
77604,"The chest area was a little roomy, but not bad, a fair amount of room around my arms and armpits (which is usually a problem for me), but the material has no stretch and there just wasn't enough room around my rib cage, just way too tight.",77604,4
77605,Was exactly like advertised.,77605,4
77605,I am very satisfied with this product.,77605,4
77606,"The swim trunks are attractive and have an inner lining of breathable fabric, but unlike most swim trunks, this pair does not have the traditional mesh briefs inside.",77606,4
77606,"You either ""swing free"" or wear your own underpants.",77606,4
77607,So far so good in terms of wearability and durability.,77607,4
77607,I have washed it (inside out) and there is no pilling or pulling.,77607,4
77607,It fit as expected and looks really good.,77607,4
77607,Colors have not faded after washing and it held its shape without shrinking.,77607,4
77607,"The materials are good, but the stitching in some places is a little sloppy.",77607,4
77607,My biggest complaint is the zipper...,77607,4
77607,This is a MENS outfit but the zipper is BACKWARDS!,77607,4
77607,Zipper goes on the right... not the left!,77607,4
77607,"Come on people, get with the program.",77607,4
77607,I would also like to see a little larger zipper and the cord in the pants a little longer.,77607,4
77607,"Minus 1/2 star for zipper opening from the wrong side, minus 1/4 for small zipper, and minus 1/4 star for short pants cord.",77607,4
77609,"Good looking, GREAT Color!!!!!",77609,4
77609,I have NOTHING Bad to say about this GREAT HAT!!,77609,4
77610,It was a little tight around the hips but I liked it a lot,77610,4
77611,"It scrathes easy but really, that's to be expected with metal, especially seen with black.",77611,4
77611,Got it for my husband and he lives it!,77611,4
77611,My daughter has one that she has had for about 2 years.,77611,4
77611,It opens and closes easy and stays closed when snapped shut.,77611,4
77612,I got these to wear to my grandfathers memorial service.,77612,4
77612,Fit like a charm never had any issue with them.,77612,4
77612,They were comfy and fit just perfectly.,77612,4
77614,"It's a little smaller than expected, but the seller warned of this so I ordered above babies size, and I'm glad I did because this outfit is super cute!",77614,4
77615,I received this product fairly fast.,77615,4
77615,It was in a nice/elegant package.,77615,4
77615,I bought this based on the healing description.,77615,4
77615,I like the weight of the bracelet.,77615,4
77615,It does not feel flimsy or cheap.,77615,4
77616,"light and comfortable, perfect fit",77616,4
77617,Good quality and color...just order up in size,77617,4
77618,I haven't worn this in the pool yet but I think it will suit my needs.,77618,4
77618,I wanted good support for wearing under a swim shirt in my water aerobics class.,77618,4
77618,Band around ribcage under the cups is a little large but the cup size and support were fine so I decided to keep it rather than exchanging for one size smaller.,77618,4
77619,"Ran small , but well made",77619,4
77620,Great little swim suit.,77620,4
77620,Only complaint is with the top.,77620,4
77620,It is made big and slides down when swimming,77620,4
77621,I bought these not quite a year ago and have been pleased with them except that they are getting worn out.,77621,4
77621,I have them in a pair of shoes that I wear about 1/4 of the time.,77621,4
77621,They are still doing their job but both insoles have large wear holes were my big toes touch them.,77621,4
77621,One of the heels also has a wear hole.,77621,4
77621,The instep portion of one insole is starting to break down.,77621,4
77621,The insoles are still serviceable but probably for not much longer.,77621,4
77621,"I do like these insoles, I just wish they would hold up better.",77621,4
77621,I have custom made leather insoles I bought 20 years ago and they have years of life left.,77621,4
77621,Perhaps I am expecting too much.,77621,4
77621,Any comments on that would be appreciated.,77621,4
77622,It enhanced my Dad's look!,77622,4
77623,It is super cute and I can't wait to wear it on Spring break!,77623,4
77623,"It is a little small in the chest and bottom, and I actually ordered a size bigger than the size chart.",77623,4
77624,More feminine than just black or dark blue.,77624,4
77624,"And the graphics are awesome, a vintage look.",77624,4
77624,Problem is with the neckline.,77624,4
77624,"Is way too high, almost choking.",77624,4
77624,"I have to make a V-cut into it on the front to loosen it up and unfortunately couldn't cut hardly more than an inch because the graphics are situated so high on the front, it wouldn't have cut into the graphics.",77624,4
77624,I made it work but still the neckline is weird.,77624,4
77625,Perfect set of stud earrings.,77625,4
77625,Arrived in great condition and exactly what I hope they'd be.,77625,4
77626,"Very nice material , stylish sexy and bey practical !",77626,4
77626,A bit larger than expected but definitely recommended always remember to pick a smaller size !,77626,4
77628,"At 5'9"" 175lbs this comes to about my knees so if you're wanting a full length look and you're tall this won't do it.",77628,4
77628,"But it's super cute, comfortable and soft and you can't beat the price!",77628,4
77628,Bought it in the seafoamy blue color and can't wait to wear it this summer!,77628,4
77629,"High quality, opaque work out legging for a reasonable price.",77629,4
77629,"Sometimes they run a bit small in the waist, depends on who manufactures them, but if you try enough pairs you will find one that fits perfectly.",77629,4
77630,This is a cute swimwear.,77630,4
77630,I found the under wire a bit uncomfortable.,77630,4
77630,You definitely can take the wire out and it would be fine.,77630,4
77631,Does a fine job of keeping the sun off of my bald spot.,77631,4
77632,My kids love these robes!,77632,4
77632,"They are super warm, have big pockets and an attached hood.",77632,4
77632,I love the prints and the high quality fabric.,77632,4
77632,"However, I wish the ties were a tad longer and I wish an internal tie was included to keep the robe from slightly opening at the chest.",77632,4
77632,Overall a great purchase though!,77632,4
77633,Good shoe for the price,77633,4
77634,The shirt is awesome the material is a little thin but still wearable,77634,4
77635,"I was unaware these were glass plugs when I first got them, and sure enough one fell out in the shower the 2nd day I had them and shattered.",77635,4
77635,But other than that they were very pretty.,77635,4
77635,I wish I could order a single instead of another pair.,77635,4
77635,Just be aware that these are fragile.,77635,4
77636,Love the ring got it in time pakeagin was ok.,77636,4
77637,I like it a lot pulls in my stomach and well not so much lifts the butt but still helps with the overall look,77637,4
77638,Originally ordered it in a 4x but it was too small so have it to a friend.,77638,4
77638,The  5x fits better but could be a little longer in the torso area.,77638,4
77638,This bathing suits run very small as I normally wear a 10 USA size in pants and a 1x top.,77638,4
77638,The main problem is the torso area is just a little short but it fits and looks very cute.,77638,4
77638,Would be more comfortable if the torso was just an inch or two longer.,77638,4
77638,It is well made and very different than all the swimdresses out there I do get lots of compliments when I have worn it.,77638,4
77639,I feel fat when I wear this so I dont....,77639,4
77640,"The ring is beautiful, and I really love it!",77640,4
77640,I just wish the stone is  bigger.,77640,4
77641,Comfortable and it looks really nice with a skirt and heels.,77641,4
77642,Really cute and thin.,77642,4
77642,I was looking for.,77642,4
77642,Think jacket for summer.,77642,4
77642,My only problem is that inns to order for a 2-3 year old because they run small.,77642,4
77642,My son is 17 months and 26 pounds.,77642,4
77642,Very fast shipping as well.,77642,4
77643,"Great shirt, love the saying.",77643,4
77643,"Fabric is very thin, but soft and stretchy.",77643,4
77644,This was fun- wore it on vacation until I lost it in a waterfall.,77644,4
77645,I am 5'0 and weigh about 260.,77645,4
77645,I typically wear  a size 24 dress.,77645,4
77645,It was not tight at all and it fell just above the knee.,77645,4
77645,The fabric does not wrinkle so it's great for packing in a suitcase.,77645,4
77645,I dropped a star because the material used to tie the cover up at the top was really scratchy.,77645,4
77646,"Great jacket, nice and light weight.",77646,4
77646,Threading got unloosened too soon.,77646,4
77646,But not unexpected becaue of the price.,77646,4
77647,good for what it is.,77647,4
77647,I am sure it will continue to be good.,77647,4
77647,It rolls up at the bottom and makes it hard to get into my pockets.,77647,4
77647,I wear a 2x and bought a 3 band.,77647,4
77647,I am only 9-11 weeks when purchased and reviewed,77647,4
77648,"I wear size 0 or 1 and I order the small one but it was too small on me, the material is good quality and its stretchy
I would order a larger size next time",77648,4
77649,was for someone else.,77649,4
77650,Loved the way it fit.,77650,4
77651,it kinda of torpedoed my boobs.,77651,4
77651,makes me think of 1950's bras.,77651,4
77652,It was a little bit larger than I expected but still a really cute top,77652,4
77653,"I thought a size 16 would work, had to return that one, and get a size 18",77653,4
77654,"I like it, but delivery was very long",77654,4
77655,"Worth it, will but again next year as i lost this one already :)",77655,4
77657,This product was perfect for a recent trip to Siberia.,77657,4
77657,It provided plenty of warmth and protection from the wind in -40 C. For cold climates or motorcyclists as an under layer this will keep you warm.,77657,4
77657,It is easily adjustable and dries quickly.,77657,4
77658,I love these gauges.,77658,4
77658,"They are nice and sturdy, they don't feel cheap.",77658,4
77658,They don't fold or collapse in my ear like others I've purchased for way more than I paid for these.,77658,4
77658,The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because the picture is a bit deceiving on the color.,77658,4
77658,"The colors are very light, and in a couple pairs u can barely see what color its supposed to be once it's in ur ear.",77658,4
77658,"Otherwise, good buy for a good price.",77658,4
77659,like the robe but need to return as it is too small,77659,4
77660,"Made well with soft maternity, beautiful bright colors.",77660,4
77661,I have many jersey material skirts so when I put this one on I expected it to fit differently than it does.,77661,4
77661,Not a pencil skirt or anything but it reminds me of the girl's skirts in Grease.,77661,4
77661,Very comfortable and I love I don't have to wear a slip because it just attaches to my leggings.,77661,4
77661,So funny though that I was asked to review it today and I'm wearing it.,77661,4
77662,Received the product fast which is a plus.,77662,4
77662,I didn't give it 5 stars because half sizes are not offered.,77662,4
77662,I wear a 12.5 ring but had to go to a 13 because of this.,77662,4
77662,The 13 is a little lose but not enough for it to slip off my finger.,77662,4
77662,Overall a good product,77662,4
77663,I just wish the D rings were not so big.,77663,4
77664,The reviews stated that i should get 1-2 sizes larger as the shirt fits small.,77664,4
77664,I usually wear small or medium and I took my chances with medium.,77664,4
77664,"The shirt fit well, but I like my clothes to be a bit tighter so I guess I could have gotten a small, but who knows how small the small would have been for me.",77664,4
77664,I'm a size 34B and weigh 127lbs and it was more than enough room.,77664,4
77664,The fabric wasn't the greatest imo.,77664,4
77664,I don't think it's see through but I have yet to test that.,77664,4
77664,"The shirt comes in nicely folded, but it needs to be ironed before you can wear it out somewhere.",77664,4
77665,Very comfortable; love mid length,77665,4
77666,"beautiful tiara, i gave them as gifts to identical twin, adult sisters.",77666,4
77666,"The tiaras were beautiful, bu t had to be shaped (carefully) to fit their heads.",77666,4
77668,"these are pretty heavy, but they are so cute.",77668,4
77668,I  love them and will continue to wear them with any outfit I can!,77668,4
77669,Love this shirt and comfortable!,77669,4
77669,Don't put in the dryer make sure to hang dry!,77669,4
77670,"But I am 5'9"" and a size 16 and I wish that it was a little bit wider and longer.",77670,4
77670,"If you are big chested or carry your weight on top, then it will not be long on you..",77670,4
77671,good quality and very comfy.,77671,4
77672,It's a nice fit for a larger bustline and holds very securely.,77672,4
77672,The band around the chest fit very snug (almost too snug).,77672,4
77674,"Cool sox,fun prints and colors,good price.",77674,4
77676,The only reason it did not receive 5 stars was because the stitching on the inside of shoe is sharp and uncomfortable.,77676,4
77676,I definitely can't wear these without socks.,77676,4
77677,Otherwise very sexy and good quality,77677,4
77678,Full lining in front.,77678,4
77679,it needs a scarf; very bland but fits fine,77679,4
77680,Just wish it had at least a button or something to keep the ID from falling out.,77680,4
77681,I should have ordered for a small but the reveiw makes it seem like the small will be too small and it won't fit that well.,77681,4
77681,I ended up ordering for a medium and it was too big.,77681,4
77681,"I am 5'9"" and 135 pounds.",77681,4
77681,Overrall the dress is really go.,77681,4
77681,I will order for it again but a small size next time.,77681,4
77682,"Because these are compression shirts, I expected the US S/Asian M to be a little tighter fitting than I received.",77682,4
77682,They ended up being really loose and didn't compress at all.,77682,4
77682,I recommend going by the Asian size to have any compression at all.,77682,4
77682,"That being said, I like the feel of the material which wicks away sweat pretty well.",77682,4
77682,"The dyes don't really bleed in the wash which is nice, and they are decent shirts.",77682,4
77682,My only issue was with the sizing.,77682,4
77683,"This is a gift, I don't know what the person will think about them",77683,4
77684,Super cute but I'm making it only four stars because the breast area is way too large and the head hole is hard to get in.,77684,4
77684,I got a small weigh 125 and I'm 5 feet tall with curves,77684,4
77685,"Only complaint is there was one spot with a small blob of gold on one of the earrings, where you couldn't see the veins of the leaf.",77685,4
77686,"I ordered a medium, should have went with a large.",77686,4
77686,"It fits, just not as long or flowy as the picture.",77686,4
77686,I normally wear a medium in women's shirts.,77686,4
77687,"Pretty dress,  well mean, pretty embroidery just wasn't the right side.",77687,4
77687,I wasn't fond of the shiny apron  or I would have given it five stars.,77687,4
77687,Very pretty Oktoberfest outfit !,77687,4
77688,My wife likes it for casual wear.,77688,4
77688,Keeps good time and cool looking.,77688,4
77690,"Got a large, and I feel it actually fit like a large.",77690,4
77690,"I'm 5'5"" and pear shaped, and it was long enough and fit well.",77690,4
77690,"Maybe a little roomy in the bust area, but I don't mind.",77690,4
77690,It seems very pretty and a decent quality.,77690,4
77690,Glad I bought it!,77690,4
77691,Nice but a little cheaply made.,77691,4
77692,LOVE these boots but they are uncomfortable to drive in because it's difficult to flex at the ankle.,77692,4
77692,"I feel confident that this is just a ""breaking in"" issue, so I'm not upset by it.",77692,4
77692,"Aside from ankle flex, they look great, feel great, and I want to buy them in black as well.",77692,4
77693,"Super cute, but runs small in the arms.",77693,4
77694,order a size larger !,77694,4
77694,but it a great hoodie,77694,4
77696,"Dress is very see through, you need a slip under it or you can see your underwear.",77696,4
77696,"But for 6 dollars, you can't complain.",77696,4
77696,"It came early, about 2 weeks.",77696,4
77696,"I'm tiny and this fits perfect (5'1, 95 pounds) it seems like an asian size.",77696,4
77696,I wouldn't get this if you're taller than 5 foot 4 or weigh more than 120 or it might be to short/too small.,77696,4
77697,So happy with it.,77697,4
77697,Fits a little small though so if a medium is normally looser on you then it will be fitted.,77697,4
77698,it fits but not as oversized as it looks on the picture,77698,4
77699,So cool and cute love the colors,77699,4
77700,"The dress and material looked and felt great, the only thing was a received an imperfect dress.",77700,4
77700,There were loose strings and extra stitching on the outside of the garment.,77700,4
77700,"I did not wear it, although I would have  because it looked great on.",77700,4
77700,"I'm 5""4 weighing 166 bra size  34DD and a medium was just right.",77700,4
77701,The earrings are beautiful and made well.,77701,4
77701,The only thing that kept me from giving them 5 stars is that they are very heavy.,77701,4
77702,All expectations were met.,77702,4
77703,purchased as a xmas present,77703,4
77705,"They're nice, however Even though I purchased the size large, I found it necessary to stretch them in order for them to fit.",77705,4
77706,The back opening is smaller than what picture showed.,77706,4
77706,The material is a bit itchy side.,77706,4
77706,"However, its really lovely and sexy.",77706,4
77707,The picture shown is incorrect but the jumpsuit looked as I expected; however it was too small.,77707,4
77709,My daughter is a big Batman fan and loved this sweatshirt.,77709,4
77709,She usually wears an extra small shirt so the small fit perfectly.,77709,4
77709,She likes how soft and comfortable it is.,77709,4
77710,It's cute and a good party top but it is a lot shorter than it appears.,77710,4
77710,"It's honestly basically a bra, no complaints but I wish I knew.",77710,4
77711,You get what you pay for,77711,4
77712,"It's pretty and I love the fact that it's reversible, which wasn't advertised (bonus!).",77712,4
77712,"Unlike comments by other reviewers, the brim is plenty stiff to stay off my face.",77712,4
77712,The main thing I dislike is the plastic clips on the chin strap are so stiff they render the chin strap unusable.,77712,4
77714,"Wore for the Superbowl, pleased w purchase.",77714,4
77715,"My son likes these, he says they're comfortable.",77715,4
77715,"They are pricy but I guess, among his set, stylish?",77715,4
77716,"Material seemed kinda rough/hard ..
Way too big for my daughter but still super cute
Can't wait for them to fit",77716,4
77717,Like it very well,77717,4
77718,"I love it , it stays in place it's a bit tight so I suggest you get a size bigger for a better fit but other than that it's great.",77718,4
77719,"This dress is so beautiful,just like it looks on the picture.",77719,4
77719,"very rich material, I usually wear size M,but after reading the reviews about buying a size up, I took a chance a ordered an XL and it fits perfectly.",77719,4
77719,Highly recommend it to anyone.,77719,4
77720,"fit as expected, the only bad part is if you're not flat chested, may the Lord be with you.",77720,4
77720,your breasts will not breathe and will be stuck together for the rest of the day.,77720,4
77720,"it's like a mini bra, but like really mini.",77720,4
77720,"the top is see thru, at first I thought it wasn't until I wore it.",77720,4
77720,I still wear it.,77720,4
77720,"but if you don't enjoy your melons being shown, you shouldn't buy it.",77720,4
77721,"These are lovely...painted nicely...But are larger than I thought they were...Bought for my young grand daughter, but I am giving them to my daughter instead as they are too large for the grand....",77721,4
77722,"I really really liked it, except I ordered a large and I still didn't fit  I normally wear a bra size of 38-40D and if I order a large top, it's usually fine.",77722,4
77722,"But the cups were so ridiculously small, I'm bulging out.",77722,4
77723,"NICE COLOR, REALLY COMFORTABLE AND THE MESH ON THE SIDE IS NICE & AIRY.",77723,4
77723,THE WIDTH FOR MY FEET WAS A BIT TOO WIDE BUT I WEAR THEM ANYWAY FOR THE COMFORT ALMOST EVERY DAY!,77723,4
77724,Somewhat large but I like it.,77724,4
77725,I got this shirt a little big.,77725,4
77725,"I usually wear a medium, got a large.",77725,4
77725,"I like it, it's comfy.",77725,4
77726,Fits upper body well if you have breasts,77726,4
77727,the only thing about these pants is the material wasn't the best in quality i disapointed but they look good on & i like the style,77727,4
77728,Came quickly and printed nicely,77728,4
77729,Its a very sexy lingerie and stretchy.,77729,4
77729,The fit is ok but felt big on me.,77729,4
77729,"Sadly will be returning it, wish they had a small.",77729,4
77729,Im a size 36 C and the wires the hold them were big.,77729,4
77729,Maybe this one was returned because it way to stretched out especially around the hip area.,77729,4
77730,My husband liked it,77730,4
77731,Great price and sturdy.,77731,4
77731,My daughter loads it up with her books and it's held up.,77731,4
77732,"It is beautiful, fits just right.",77732,4
77733,Color is incredibly true to the picture.,77733,4
77733,"The dress fits beautifully in the chest/waist area, a little poofy on the bottom.",77733,4
77734,i love the pendent but the necklace that comes with it is terrible.,77734,4
77734,It changed color in just 1 week.,77734,4
77734,I replaced the necklace piece with a better necklace.,77734,4
77736,"Didn't think I would like this product but the fit was nice and even better, I was comfortable all day!",77736,4
77737,Great quality and a fair price.,77737,4
77738,I like that it fits.,77738,4
77738,It's a brimmed hat and it keeps the sun off my face and neck.,77738,4
77739,"Being a wrist wallet, not carrying a purse, the wallet needs to hold phone, coupons, change, cards and ID..... My only complaint is that it needs to be a little more spacious ...",77739,4
77739,Allowing for the change and more cards or a 'hiding' spot...,77739,4
77740,"First time I order were a better quality, this time it has some quality issues, the glass come off very easily.",77740,4
77741,"Runs small, just get a bigger size then u normally wear",77741,4
77742,The pants are extremely comfortable and look nice as well.,77742,4
77742,I've gotten other culottes with similar fabric and they clung.,77742,4
77742,These pants do *not* cling to every bump and lump that most of us have at some point in life :),77742,4
77743,Like the style though.,77743,4
77744,I like the product because you can't always find a hat in size that you in that color you want.,77744,4
77744,With this product you can change the size to one that fit your needs.,77744,4
77745,Cute normally wear a medium or even small.,77745,4
77745,After reading about this I ordered an xl and it fits the way I like it.,77745,4
77745,I suggest two sizes up for this.,77745,4
77746,Would give it 5 stars if it came in larger sizes.,77746,4
77746,It's more durable than I expected.,77746,4
77747,"Sometimes I need a medium sometimes a large, this was just one instance where the large is going to be much more appropriate if I want to wear it in public.",77747,4
77747,Return of the medium was easy and the seller paid shipping costs.,77747,4
77748,This dress is a value for the money.,77748,4
77748,Runs a little big.,77748,4
77748,My daughter wears a 6x or 7 and I purchased the 6 which is plenty big.,77748,4
77748,You can't look too closely at the jewels and their placement- the design is not symmetrical or consistent.,77748,4
77748,There are a few jewels and sequins that are coming off and the hook closures are barely sewn on.,77748,4
77748,She wanted this for pictures and I think it will work fine for that purpose.,77748,4
77748,The color is more of a plum in the sunlight.,77748,4
77748,My 6 yr old is thrilled with it!,77748,4
77748,I also purchased a hoop skirt for her to wear underneath.,77748,4
77749,Not to tight or loose.,77749,4
77749,So far a good product.,77749,4
77751,they are so pretty.,77751,4
77751,maybe just a bit bigger then I wanted but nice...,77751,4
77752,perfect for what I wanted it for..... Love these colors!!,77752,4
77753,"Top was a bit large, shorts were a bit small, (a bit tight.)",77753,4
77754,"This was a very, very, revealing and risqu monokini style piece.",77754,4
77754,Doesn't really hold chest area in place well at all so expect spillage at top.,77754,4
77754,Your entire back is out and the entire bottom half of your backside.,77754,4
77754,My cousin is 165 lbs and 5'7 and she said the medium fit very SNUG so we are returning for a large.,77754,4
77755,The shoulders are a bit small so it doesn't go off the shoulders well and the rest is a bit baggy.,77755,4
77755,It is a nice shirt though and is very comfortable and I am pleased with it.,77755,4
77756,Not fancy but they work.,77756,4
77757,"This shirt is a great option, however, it was a little short on the bottom as compared to the picture.",77757,4
77757,Otherwise it fits great.,77757,4
77758,Looks and fits exactly as shown in picture,77758,4
77759,got these for my little sisters play she was in.,77759,4
77759,she says they were comfortable.,77759,4
77760,I absolutely love this top.,77760,4
77760,I'm a 40 DD & I ordered a 5x since everyone said it runs very small.,77760,4
77760,"To be completely honest, I wouldn't mind it being a tad bigger.",77760,4
77760,It's a tad frustrating but I'll squeeze since its so cute.,77760,4
77760,The bottoms on the other hand are huge but that doesn't matter since I wasn't gonna wear them with the top anyways.,77760,4
77761,Wore this pre-baby and in the hospital after labor.,77761,4
77761,Comfy and flattering for big baby bellies!,77761,4
77761,It gave me something nice to wear besides a hospital gown for pictures and visitors.,77761,4
77762,"This are very pretty, all the designs are different and very attractive.",77762,4
77762,The gauge is a 16 and it fits very nicely on me.,77762,4
77762,i have a small face/nose and this doesn't look huge like most clickers on the market.,77762,4
77762,"The reasons why I removed 1 star are: the design is only on the front of the piece, the back is just random or flat and the whole piece is not made of stainless steel, just the bar that will go into the perforation, so I don't recommend extended use or showering with these since they will most likely tarnish and/or turn green, but, Hey!",77762,4
77762,For the price these are a great bargain.,77762,4
77762,I kept 3 and gave one to a friend for her birthday.,77762,4
77763,I do like the dress it looks a bit different then I was expecting maybe a tad bit cheaper then I had pictured.. the sequins r much larger then I would have liked.. but all in all I do like the way it fits my body it is a bit big but I am very small chested..,77763,4
77763,"I ordered a small and am 5'3""  and 117lbs if u have my build I would recommend an XS of u would like it snug on ur body;)",77763,4
77764,I really like this shift.,77764,4
77764,"It is cotton so very light, not see thru and comfortable.",77764,4
77764,I ordered a large I could have gotten a medium but that's okay since I am elderly and like my clothes to be a bit bigger.,77764,4
77765,look just like the picture the shorts are very thin tho,77765,4
77766,I'm 34 b and I took a small size,77766,4
77767,Really cute and silly.,77767,4
77768,"overall quality is  good, the top is a little small for me... but i usually buy bikinis in two different sizes.",77768,4
77768,I love the bottoms!,77768,4
77769,"Fit well, all lights lit up, only flaw is it would occasionally turn on after I turned it off, but all in all great purchase.",77769,4
77771,"Exactly what I expected, for a great price.",77771,4
77771,"I have only worn it once, but so far, so good.",77771,4
77773,Cute but too small,77773,4
77774,Well-made and very comfortable.,77774,4
77774,All was as described.,77774,4
77775,My daughter needed a light scarf for her school musical and this scarf was perfect.,77775,4
77775,"It's a lightweight, sheer fabric and was big enough to comfortably wrap around her waist.",77775,4
77775,The price was right for what we needed it for and it held up just fine for the shows.,77775,4
77776,"I really like this, tight fit and keeps the unmentionables in.",77776,4
77776,"We had a ""code brown"" episode and everything was well contained.",77776,4
77776,I think you should buy one size up though.,77776,4
77776,"My daughter is in the 5% and at 18 months, the 18-24 month size was way too small.",77776,4
77776,We couldn't button it up.,77776,4
77776,"I know it should be snug, but these are overly small.",77776,4
77776,She now wears the 3T size and it fits her fine.,77776,4
77776,I do wish the buttons were up both sides as it is very difficult to get this on a toddler.,77776,4
77777,"If you are more on the chesty side it's hard to put over your boobs, but once you get over them girl you looking fabulous...",77777,4
77777,I do advise to maybe go up one size due to the struggle it can be to get the dress over your boobs.,77777,4
77777,However the length is right above the knee and the skirt has a nice material too.,77777,4
77777,"This dress is a must have if are looking for a cheap, cute, casual dress.",77777,4
77778,Liked the looks of this maxi lounger but ordered too large.,77778,4
77778,Have reordered a smaller size.,77778,4
77778,"Color very pretty, well made, soft.",77778,4
77779,Very neat looking necklace.,77779,4
77779,As others have noted a touch difficult to maintain forward.,77779,4
77779,Great quality nice design.,77779,4
77780,"To be fair, I saw all the reviews that spoke of the gold plating coming off this necklace -- that's why I bought it.",77780,4
77780,"I hate yellow gold, but I love silver.",77780,4
77780,"I wore this for a couple of days (a week, max) before the gold started coming off and I got the necklace I wanted.",77780,4
77780,"I love the formatting of the text, the font, and the size of the necklace in general.",77780,4
77780,It's one of my favorites.,77780,4
77780,I took off one star just because it's difficult to keep the text flipped in the right direction when there's virtually no room to move it around on the chain.,77780,4
77781,xxl was more like a large.,77781,4
77782,I like the sterling I have when wearing it.,77782,4
77782,It needs to be a little more durable for firmer tummy control,77782,4
77783,"After reading other reviews, I ordered larger than I usually wear.",77783,4
77783,"Smelled a little weird, but it's light and airy.",77783,4
77783,Just what I was looking for the summer.,77783,4
77785,I would have given it 5 stars but the edges are all serged and the tank straps are pretttt delicate.,77785,4
77785,"Great for creepers at the gym, though!",77785,4
77786,I love this pant.,77786,4
77786,"I am about 5'6"" and ard 130 pounds and the small fit perfectly.",77786,4
77786,I especially like the convenience of the small side pockets.,77786,4
77786,This was a great buy.,77786,4
77787,"I am a bigger girl, so I ordered the 3x because I didn't know if it would shrink after washing, and if so, how much it would shrink.",77787,4
77787,I would recommend buying a size larger than you would normally wear as it does shrink  slightly.,77787,4
77787,"I tried it on as soon as it arrived and it was a little roomy, but not too bad.",77787,4
77787,"Then, I put it through the wash and it fit a little better after that.",77787,4
77787,"I am 5'3"", so most things I wear are too long in the sleeves or leg area and this is no different.",77787,4
77787,"The sleeves cover half my hand and the bottom reaches almost to my ankles, but I still love it.",77787,4
77787,It's very comfortable and the material is not that heavy.,77787,4
77787,I would definitely buy another!,77787,4
77789,Fits like a super mini.,77789,4
77790,I love this piece I like how it looks on me its a bit short from the back but it's a beach attire so I don't mind it at all :) I gave it a 4 star because I need to lose a few lbs (which I'm working on lol) for it to look perfect  can't wait for my trip to Cancun!,77790,4
77790,For reference I'm 5'3 and weigh about 185,77790,4
77791,Not worth the price.,77791,4
77791,That being said it is comfy.,77791,4
77791,I ordered larger than needed to allow for shrinkage!,77791,4
77792,Got them for my younger sister as a christmas gift.,77792,4
77792,She uses them for both a head scarf and around her neck!,77792,4
77793,go up a size or two.,77793,4
77793,Does not fit loose whatsoever.,77793,4
77794,Don't worry about the reviews.,77794,4
77796,I received the package right away.,77796,4
77796,The quality of the dress is great.,77796,4
77796,"Couple adjustments need to be made for my personal perference, but overall satisfied.",77796,4
77796,"Very beautiful, worth the buy.",77796,4
77797,Perfect for work but I expected it to be a little looser.,77797,4
77797,I am 5'00'' and 120 pounds and ordered a small but it is still kind of tight and short.,77797,4
77798,Less expensive and easier to find than in the stores.,77798,4
77799,It came in just as expected I'm like it very much except for it being transparent in the bottom area,77799,4
77800,My little man looks so handsome in it.,77800,4
77801,The ID window is very helpful.,77801,4
77801,Doesn't comfortably hold more than 4 cards.,77801,4
77801,Got it for my wife.,77801,4
77802,"I am 5'6"" 160 lbs with triple d boobs.",77802,4
77802,I don't mind being super revealing but it if that isn't your thing don't get this.,77802,4
77802,Runs very small so if you are over a size 6 do not get this.,77802,4
77802,It justttt fits me.,77802,4
77803,she will grow into them...,77803,4
77804,This is the perfect bag for me.,77804,4
77804,I'm the type of person that carries just the essentials and this bag does that.,77804,4
77804,"It holds all my credit cards, loose change and phone.",77804,4
77804,It's easy to carry around and does not get in the way while I move.,77804,4
77804,I love the color and it's such a bonus to have the wrist and shoulder strap as options.,77804,4
77804,"The only issue I have is the outside material of the bag,...it looked a lot better online but for the price I guess you get what you pay for.",77804,4
77804,"Other than that, love this bag!",77804,4
77805,great looking ties for cheap,77805,4
77806,fun colors-just as described,77806,4
77807,A bit shorter than expected.,77807,4
77808,Not exactly like the one in the show.,77808,4
77809,The inside pockets are not really useable.,77809,4
77809,Two of them are too small and not deep enough.,77809,4
77809,"The other 3 are all on top of each other, so using them all gets bulky, plus they are floppy so you need both hands to put things into them.",77809,4
77809,Otherwise a cute purse and a good size.,77809,4
77810,my daughter loved it,77810,4
77811,My friend told me this was a must have pregnancy product.,77811,4
77811,I like that the ice pack/ warm pack slips right into the band.,77811,4
77811,I intend to use this in reverse after my c section as well.,77811,4
77811,"I only gave it four stars, because it's not a ""miracle"" band as some have touted, but helps from time to time.",77811,4
77812,"It looks nicer than the low price, but clearly not an expensive piece.",77812,4
77812,"If you have sensitive ears, I would stay away from this.",77812,4
77812,"This made the perfect stocking stuffer, and a small gift for an owner of a Tuxedo cat.",77812,4
77813,Love the button details I bought a black and white overall beautiful,77813,4
77814,Nothing bad I can say.,77814,4
77814,It came just as expected.,77814,4
77814,I mean its a plain tshirt haha,77814,4
77815,"I like you, it fit my body perfectly!",77815,4
77816,this ring is very nice,77816,4
77817,"Nice quality, but a little small for 100's.",77817,4
77817,Would be great for shorts.,77817,4
77818,These really are great diapers.,77818,4
77818,Only downside is that they run so small.,77818,4
77818,Soon my average size 1.5 year old won't fit into any of these any more.,77818,4
77818,The snaps on the side make taking it off when wet much easier.,77818,4
77818,And it definitely does contain #2's... and doesn't stain when washed hours later when we get home.,77818,4
77819,"These are not shoes, it's a child's purse.",77819,4
77819,Appearance when new = 5 stars!,77819,4
77819,It's super well made of felt -- which gets dirty easily.,77819,4
77819,The flower is well-attached to the purse.,77819,4
77819,"The color is dense, the flower is perky.",77819,4
77819,"Size is about 4--"" x 6"", like a coin purse.",77819,4
77819,"It isn't lined, so again, susceptibility to staining from 'filthy ochre.'",77819,4
77819,Will look sweet in photos for awhile but not if carried very long by a toddler.,77819,4
77819,I may steal the perky flower off this one before it gets dirty to use it elsewhere.,77819,4
77820,"Hopefully, my client will like it.",77820,4
77820,If so will order again.,77820,4
77821,"Great value, stylish, functional.",77821,4
77822,My wife needed one and this was the cheapest one we could find,77822,4
77823,The top is very thin material and the bottom is heavy and thick.,77823,4
77823,It's still cute but your either going to be cold or hot in this lol,77823,4
77824,"Scuba suit material, which at first was weird but I kind of like it for running.",77824,4
77824,It fits true to size and really cute colors.,77824,4
77824,"The only complaint I would have is the torso is really short in comparison to the arms, and it creases really easy.",77824,4
77825,I received compliments on the necklace.,77825,4
77825,Ear rings are a bit heavy.,77825,4
77826,"Very good but the sheets do not fit well on the pedals, change the sheets and all good.",77826,4
77827,For the price it could have been made some what better.,77827,4
77827,Definitely  the material could have bee better.,77827,4
77828,This is a cute play on a traditional black t-shirt.,77828,4
77828,I really like the lace on the back of the shirt.,77828,4
77829,"Fit well to my son, they're pretty true to size, the sticker started to peel after couple washes, and the color faded.",77829,4
77829,But for that price not that bad of a deal.,77829,4
77830,The necklace arrived as shown and is a great accessory piece.,77830,4
77830,"While it is not high quality, for the price it is a great, fun necklace to wear out or to work.",77830,4
77831,Nice top .Its not a hoodie like it says.,77831,4
77831,the material is thin so it is great for the summer.,77831,4
77832,I bought these as a gift for my daughter who is a daily leggings wearer.,77832,4
77832,"She is a bit of a fanatic when it comes to her leg wear, and her favorite black tights had worn a hole in the knee.",77832,4
77832,"These turned out to be great for regular, every day use.",77832,4
77832,The colors of both were true to the pictures.,77832,4
77832,The fit was comfortable.,77832,4
77832,"The only issue she had was a bit of bagging in the crotch area, but this was not enough to keep her from keeping or wearing the leggings.",77832,4
77832,"So far, they seem to be wearing very well, there is no color variation or wearing points.",77832,4
77832,"Surprisingly, she wears the grey more than the black as it's almost a ""warm"" grey.",77832,4
77832,It's a very rich pigmented color which matches many of her tops.,77832,4
77832,"For the price, this was a great purchase, I deducted one star for the baggy crotch area.",77832,4
77833,"If I didn't have the silicone band around the bottom, I don't think the band would have stayed in place.",77833,4
77833,But thankfully I ordered the one that did and found it doesn't ride up or shift around too much.,77833,4
77833,"Some adjustment may be needed when standing up from a sitting position, but I found it to be minimal.",77833,4
77833,"There was a lot of extra fabric for wearing in early pregnancy when I was about 12 weeks, but it didn't look right to fold it over completely in half like the model does.",77833,4
77833,I just folded the extra down over my stomach and it was fine.,77833,4
77833,I'm now 19 weeks and the band is still going strong.,77833,4
77833,"I wear it every day and have extended the life of my black dress pants for work, because these suckers are not going to button up anymore.",77833,4
77833,"Worth the investment to prolong going into maternity pants for as long as possible, and to be more comfortable when your regular clothes get tight but maternity would be too baggy.",77833,4
77834,This is a lovely moon necklace and chain.,77834,4
77834,"However, I thought the charm that hangs down from the tip of the moon looked a little cheap.",77834,4
77834,It's not as vivid as I thought it would be.,77834,4
77834,"So, I removed it and added a tiny crystal charm to it that I purchased on a trip I took.",77834,4
77834,Now it's perfect for me!,77834,4
77834,Please note original necklace doesn't come with crystal charm displayed in picture.,77834,4
77835,I mean its just gorgeous.,77835,4
77835,the look the feel everything.,77835,4
77835,one thing I don't like is the buckle pin(dont know its name) is removable.,77835,4
77835,easy to get lost,77835,4
77836,I think it's very pretty.,77836,4
77836,Ordered a size XL too big!,77836,4
77836,But overall it's pretty!,77836,4
77837,The fabric and workmanship is superior.,77837,4
77837,It is a little short in length.,77837,4
77837,I rarely find swimwear that is snug.,77837,4
77837,A tall woman might prefer to select a larger size than usual.,77837,4
77837,The cut is comparable to a competition suit.,77837,4
77837,The legs are perfect.,77837,4
77837,The wide straps remain in place.,77837,4
77837,"Overall, I think it is a good suit or the money, good enough to reorder.",77837,4
77838,Not a lot of stretch and the size is somewhat small and limiting.,77838,4
77839,Overall great shirt decal looks a like weird though.,77839,4
77840,"Sleeves only really go down to mid forearm, but otherwise, cute sweater.",77840,4
77841,black is the best material,77841,4
77842,Like pictured and very cute.,77842,4
77842,I get many compliments.,77842,4
77844,Only complaint was that the fabric was a little thick,77844,4
77845,I have ordered a Medium size and it fits ok but a little bit bigger than expected.,77845,4
77846,This dress is smoking hot!,77846,4
77846,The only downside is the attached skirt is sewn in a bit too high and my butt hangs out in the back.,77846,4
77846,I  just wear spandex short shorts under and it's perfect.,77846,4
77847,"I would give this five stars but it took 3 weeks to receive this tankini, but after reading all the reviews, I went up a size and it fits perfect.",77847,4
77848,"I read the reviews that it was ""smaller"" so I ordered the medium, well..",77848,4
77848,I could and probably should have went with the small instead.,77848,4
77848,it still does the job though!,77848,4
77848,not as long as It looks in the picture.,77848,4
77848,"For the price, id say this is well worth the money",77848,4
77849,"This purse, is AMAZING!",77849,4
77849,"It's really good quality, and I love the size!",77849,4
77849,But the only thing is the fact that it was packed wrong so there is a 1 1/2 Inch Dent,77849,4
77850,"Lovely garment, but not what I could use",77850,4
77851,I like the purse but it is smaller then what i thought it would be.,77851,4
77851,The tooling is beautiful on it.,77851,4
77851,"And my Sig Sauer P238 fits great
in the back pocket of the purse wish it was a little larger.",77851,4
77852,"Very sparkly, light weight and comfortable.",77852,4
77852,It covers my entire earlobe.,77852,4
77853,Very nice driving gloves.,77853,4
77853,"Thin, and yet warm even up here in the mountains.",77853,4
77853,"They grip well, to the point of being a little sticky on the steering wheel or a metal doorknob.",77853,4
77853,The only downside (and you can just see this on the model) is that each glove has a round metal advertisement with the company name on the glove.,77853,4
77853,"If you don't mind advertising every day for the manufacturer, you'll be happy with these.",77853,4
77853,I wish they had put their logo on a tab or tag that I could cut out of the glove.,77853,4
77853,That's the only drawback.,77853,4
77854,This should be a fun addition...hope it travels well.,77854,4
77856,Really cute but we need a few months before this will fit!,77856,4
77857,"I am 5'3, somewhat skinny and ordered a small size.",77857,4
77857,"It came really fast, even faster than exepcted.",77857,4
77857,"While I think this Jacket is so cute, the material is not so good.",77857,4
77857,The colors are way too opaque!,77857,4
77857,"I The quality can be a lot better and that the patches could also be better, II had to add another patch to the Sh*t  one but besides that, I like the grungy style this Jacket has.",77857,4
77858,I normally wear about an 18 or a 20 so I got the plus size and they just fit.,77858,4
77858,They will not fit any larger than a 20.,77858,4
77858,They are very comfortable and very cute.,77858,4
77859,"First, I ordered two of the Children's Large for my granddaughters and the feet were too small otherwise they were okay.",77859,4
77859,I also ordered 1 Male large and 1 female large for me.,77859,4
77859,You sent two female large.,77859,4
77859,The female large fit and I would like to keep.,77859,4
77859,Have to figure out how to send back and change only three.,77859,4
77860,V cut deep in the front.,77860,4
77860,Had to add a pin and still had a lot of cleavage but still fit great!,77860,4
77862,This fit and color were perfect!,77862,4
77862,We would have paid much more at a bigger department store for exactly the same quality.,77862,4
77863,"looks exactly like the picture, clearly quality material, has a bit of weight.",77863,4
77863,It was a teensy bit smaller than expected but I was still able to fit it on my finger.,77863,4
77863,I'd suggest going a size or size and a half up from your actual ring size.,77863,4
77865,These are ok for the price.,77865,4
77865,They fit my face really well.,77865,4
77865,"They feel a little flimsy, like they won't last very long.",77865,4
77865,But they are polarized and I like that they are very lightweight.,77865,4
77865,"While they last, they should be good!",77865,4
77865,"Also, I didn't care for the cheap plastic case.",77865,4
77865,"I bought my husband a pair of sunglasses on amazon and his were way nicer with a  better case, and cheaper too!",77865,4
77865,I might get a pair of those..,77865,4
77865,"They aren't ""fashionable"", just basic sport sunglasses.",77865,4
77866,Cute top/dress that looks great with a belt synching around the hips for support.,77866,4
77867,Just fine for a good costume piece.,77867,4
77868,The left shoe seems to fit differently than the right..,77868,4
77869,I used this for a bit before I had a chance to buy maternity pants.,77869,4
77869,It was great for standing and walking.,77869,4
77869,But I have large hips and a desk job and I was really fighting to keep it from rolling up at work.,77869,4
77871,They are hard to unscrew.,77871,4
77874,Great dress for the price.,77874,4
77874,The flower is a different color than the dress i may just find another flower to replace it with,77874,4
77875,"I like the dragonfly pendant, would not call it a necklace",77875,4
77876,I was satisfied with product.,77876,4
77876,Shipment time requires improvement.,77876,4
77877,"Feel great, love them.",77877,4
77878,"This looks just like the picture, but didn't really like the way it fit me.",77878,4
77878,Somewhat small and short...,77878,4
77879,I gave this hat 4 stars only because it come off my head if I'm not careful.,77879,4
77879,It is the cutest hat ever.,77879,4
77880,Sturdy and we'll made.,77880,4
77880,"I wore it for 12 hour a day, average 4 days a week.",77880,4
77880,After 18 months it's time to replace it.,77880,4
77880,The nickel plate wore off but I'm buying another.,77880,4
77880,I wish they made a sterling silver version.,77880,4
77881,Does just what it is supposed to do.,77881,4
77881,It could be used to hold together many different things,77881,4
77882,Use this everyday to carry cards and cash when I walk or exercise.,77882,4
77882,Also is my go to wallet for everyday things like shopping.,77882,4
77882,Fits in my pocket.,77882,4
77882,Elastic keeps the cards safe and intact within the small wallet.,77882,4
77882,Have now purchased one for my spouse,77882,4
77883,"Beautiful, I like it, but send me the black not blue.",77883,4
77884,Exactly what I was looking for,77884,4
77885,Great sweatshirt for the kids,77885,4
77886,This is a great looking belt and I wear it all the time.,77886,4
77886,I did have an issue with the belt splitting and then breaking at the point of buckle.,77886,4
77886,I sent the company an email and they responded quickly and were kind.,77886,4
77886,They sent me another and I was again pleased with th product.,77886,4
77886,"Then about 2 months in, it split and broke at the buckle place again,",77886,4
77887,I received a lot of compliments.,77887,4
77887,"The quality wasn't too great, the seam was loose in the shoulder area.",77887,4
77888,I really liked the fit but the only thing I wished is that the short had more stretch to it,77888,4
77889,"Good price, see through.",77889,4
77890,"it was to small, but i manage to stretch it...it makes your stomach area heated, which is good for loosing inches..",77890,4
77890,It is a good product.,77890,4
77892,"Looked great big the bar was too short , if you have tiny nipples theses are great",77892,4
77893,Very pretty but had a small stag I had to fix.,77893,4
77895,"I got this for my daughter to wear in a play and am glad it is long (to her ankles) and that she'll be able to wear it even after the play for ""every day.""",77895,4
77896,Subtle but bright Navy colors.,77896,4
77896,EDC on my Maxpedition pack.,77896,4
77897,"very cute in the photo, but try it out and the buttons is very delicate, I fall short.",77897,4
77898,good quality but small,77898,4
77899,This is unbelievably soft on the inside.,77899,4
77899,It's also a very thick sweater material.,77899,4
77899,It does not feel or look cheap.,77899,4
77899,"I did not receive the actual ""Bay Max"" shown, or else I'd give it five stars.",77899,4
77899,But the dang thing's so cute I hardly cared.,77899,4
77900,seems are coming out a little bit after only a few wears.,77900,4
77900,Very cute though and my 3 year old loves it.,77900,4
77901,Cute top but a little larger than expected.,77901,4
77902,So I bought this belt since I fluctuate in waist size like most other folks and preset holes in belts just weren't cutting it for comfort.,77902,4
77902,I saw this on sale and gave it a shot.,77902,4
77902,"The mechanism works great, and the cut to fit was simple and left no visible evidence.",77902,4
77902,"The box it came in is really nice, and would make this belt a perfect unwrapped gift.",77902,4
77902,"However, I think that's where the problem lies.",77902,4
77902,They could have shipped the belt in a boring box and used slightly higher quality material on the belt.,77902,4
77902,"The stitching is fraying and the ""leather?""",77902,4
77902,is separating in some spots on my belt.,77902,4
77902,I probably wear the belt 2-3 times a week since ownership.,77902,4
77902,"The buckle looks just as good as the day I got it, and the ratcheting system still functions perfectly.",77902,4
77902,"So I'll wear this thing until it completely falls apart, I just can't wear it with business attire where the belt isn't covered by a shirt.",77902,4
77902,So would I buy another one?,77902,4
77902,"Yeah, but only during a great sale.",77902,4
77902,Would I give this as a gift to someone?,77902,4
77902,"*UPDATE* 11-23-2016
Marino contacted me and offered to send me a replacement belt.",77902,4
77902,I'm changing my review from 3 to 4 stars because I would have reviewed it as a 3.5 initially.,77902,4
77902,They get a .5 boost for outstanding customer service.,77902,4
77902,"I'll come back to this review in a few months and adjust the review again if warranted (in either direction, as if the replacement belt doesn't fray in a few months it's definitely a 5 star item with the customer service)",77902,4
77903,"Had to return for a larger size, seller was quick, friendly, and efficient with return.",77903,4
77903,"Cut is slightly narrow for a utility kilt, doesn't move or hang perfectly straight along the pleats.",77903,4
77903,Still very happy with it.,77903,4
77904,Read reviews ordered size up fot is perfect read reviews before ordering.,77904,4
77904,Looks beautiful and flattering.,77904,4
77904,Has boob inserts so your  not smashed down looking.,77904,4
77905,It runs a little big.,77905,4
77906,I got these today and they are cute as hell.,77906,4
77906,I had to knock a star off because the cat only had painted on eyes and not the little stone ones but other than that they are perfect.,77906,4
77906,"Stone is in place on the fish, the backs aren't bent, and they arrived earlier than estimated.",77906,4
77907,"Several of the reviews said it was a very big, over-size mask, so I ordered it for my husband, who has a pretty big head.",77907,4
77907,It will fit up to an average-size man's head,77907,4
77908,Very nice looking and washed and dried nicely.,77908,4
77908,"Have not worn yet, as I bought them for cooler weather.",77908,4
77909,"Great for when you are on your feet for most of the day, keeps knee pain at bay.",77909,4
77911,It really goes all the way up yo your upper thigh!,77911,4
77912,Worked well for my husband's event- good price.,77912,4
77913,Thankfully it has adjustable straps to adjust.,77913,4
77913,This will especially help the ladies who are busty like myself.,77913,4
77913,Abit long because I am short so I must have it altered but otherwise overall not a bad buy.,77913,4
77914,"the shoes themselves is a great fit and provide an excellent tapping sound, but they run a little small even when sized-up.",77914,4
77915,Fits pretty well but material rips easily.,77915,4
77916,They are very comfortable fits perfectly,77916,4
77921,I loved it except it was huge!,77921,4
77921,I took everyones advice and went a size up bc they were saying it runs small but I was drowning in it.,77921,4
77921,I love the outfit so I bought a size lower.,77921,4
77921,I will update once I try on the new size!,77921,4
77922,"Although they were everything I expected them to be, they ended up looking a bit too wide on my daughters feet.",77922,4
77922,I bought these for my daughters 1st birthday and they were a tad too big.,77922,4
77923,It is as ordered and expected.,77923,4
77924,The bottom is way too small but the top fits.,77924,4
77924,My only complaint is that the red side is see-through,77924,4
77925,It's cute my boobs is small but hey it come padded which is cool .,77925,4
77926,it is hand wash only,77926,4
77928,Nice drape to the fabric.,77928,4
77928,Only complaint is there were no washing instructions on any tags.,77928,4
77929,"Thick material, the attachment strap broke but other than that I love it.",77929,4
77931,Didn't realize  half of the shoe was a different color but i am starting to like it.,77931,4
77932,I recomend one size bigger than your usual,77932,4
77933,Like the style of this bracelet.,77933,4
77934,Got a lot of compliments,77934,4
77935,"My daughter grew out of her up to 12 month socks at about 9 months of age, I ordered the 12-24 month size in these.",77935,4
77935,"When they came, they looked huge, but when I put them on her feet, they are big, but not so big they will fall off.",77935,4
77935,"I guess she is between sizes, but I'm glad she has time to grow into these.",77935,4
77935,"They are cute, washed well, and  seem like they will hold up.",77935,4
77935,"I also got a great deal on them, about $1 per pair shipped!",77935,4
77935,I knocked off one star because I wish they had grips at the bottom like Carters and other brands do.,77935,4
77936,They are extremely comfortable and easy to move in.,77936,4
77936,The stitching is slightly off on one of the legs so it feels uneven at times but not enough to be a huge pain.,77936,4
77936,Waistband is also hard to get used to.,77936,4
77936,Haven't found a position that's both comfortable and flattering.,77936,4
77936,But I also have some weight around the middle.,77936,4
77936,Other than that I love them and wear them for yoga all the time,77936,4
77937,"My measurements are as follows: 32 inch underbust, 29.5 inch waist, 38 inch high hips, 10 inch torso length from under breast to lap.",77937,4
77937,"I'm 5'2"" and it is a little long and cuts into my lap a bit when I'm sitting but helps my posture.",77937,4
77937,"This is a decent faja, especially at this price.",77937,4
77937,"However, I would say that it runs large and it's not real latex.",77937,4
77937,"I bought the ""9 steel bones in black"" one and it's made of neoprene.",77937,4
77937,"This will also make you sweat, but it advertises itself as latex so it is a bit of false advertising.",77937,4
77937,"However, you might prefer the neoprene if you have a latex allergy.",77937,4
77937,I have an actual squeem faja and I'll include photos comparing the two.,77937,4
77937,"The squeem is shorter so it's better for shorter torsos, and it's actual latex.",77937,4
77937,The squeem I have is in a size small.,77937,4
77937,I ordered this one in a medium based off my measurements (I even ordered down) and it was still big on me.,77937,4
77937,I also have am very squishable and have more adipose fat on my torso so I can squish down more than someone who is all muscle.,77937,4
77937,"That being said, this faja doesn't squish in so much as all around the body.",77937,4
77937,It is very strong though and I like the multiple front adjustments and the neoprene makes you sweat a lot under it.,77937,4
77937,It also has more bones in it than the squeem so I think it helps with your posture more.,77937,4
77937,"My main takeaways are that it isn't latex when it states it's latex, but it's great for long torsos and does help with posture.",77937,4
77938,I had to alter it slightly; like I made the coat tighter and the skirt part shorter as I felt it wasn't flattering enough?,77938,4
77938,"(if that's the word I'm looking for...)
It doesn't keep you super warm, but it also doesn't make you super hot either.",77938,4
77938,"The tulle on the bottom is sort of cheap, so I just got rid of it and opted for a black petticoat underneath instead; adds to the fluff too!",77938,4
77938,Used it for a Weiss Schnee cosplay~,77938,4
77939,Really cute but one of the crystals fell out two days after the arrival.,77939,4
77939,I was able to put it back on with some super glue luckily.,77939,4
77940,These earrings are very pretty and delicate looking.,77940,4
77940,I have received complements every time I wear them.,77940,4
77940,"However, the picture is somewhat misleading.",77940,4
77940,The earrings and the stones are much smaller than pictured.,77940,4
77940,"That said, I really like the produce, and the packaging is very attractive and suitable for gifting",77940,4
77941,Really love this rosary.,77941,4
77941,Definitely holds the glow.,77941,4
77941,Only reason I knocked a star off is because the metal parts knot up real easy.,77941,4
77942,I was so excited to receive this bikini as I love the way it looks.,77942,4
77942,"I am 5'8"" 150lbs, 34D and bought a large.",77942,4
77942,The bottom was a bit large but still could have worked with it if the top wasn't too small.,77942,4
77943,I love this hat!,77943,4
77943,So warm and fun.,77943,4
77943,"It is a Christmas miracle, it took a looong time shipping, but now that I received it, it is worth the wait.",77943,4
77943,It made it for Christmas and that was important to me.,77943,4
77943,Would give 5 stars if it didn't take 5 weeks to receive.,77943,4
77944,"I love the snap closures, wished I had purchased the next size up, it fit a tad small, especially the hood.",77944,4
77945,I thought they would be a little longer,77945,4
77947,Looks cool but comes loose if accidentally brushed.,77947,4
77948,"Runs a shade small, especially in the sleeve area, but otherwise a decent shirt.",77948,4
77950,"Size ran small, had to return",77950,4
77951,"It was a Mother's Day gift, color and style was perfect.",77951,4
77951,Only thing is the clasp.,77951,4
77951,Could be easier to open.,77951,4
77952,This is a very comfortable robe if you want something cool and lightweight.,77952,4
77952,The material is very soft and a little stretchy.,77952,4
77952,It's my favorite type of fabric for pajamas.,77952,4
77952,I like the color but it is a bit smaller than expected.,77952,4
77952,It seems to be a foreign company though so I'm not really surprised that it runs a bit small.,77952,4
77954,You could find higher quality sunglasses at any KMart/Walmart/Etc.,77954,4
77954,These are knockoffs of the Dior So Real sunglasses that whattheirfaces wore - so they're popular.,77954,4
77954,"I tried on the Dior So Real sunglasses and they were ugly as hell AND 400-500$ They are 'different' though, which is the gimmick.",77954,4
77954,If you have money to blow - get the real thing.,77954,4
77954,"If you're like me and work for a living, get the knockoffs.",77954,4
77954,"The 'lenses' will not pop out - they are stapled into the frame itself and don't even rest in the bottom eyewire - so if you think you can switch out colors, nope!",77954,4
77954,"Also, you have to have a narrow face to get these puppies on - they are small.",77954,4
77954,The ones I bought were the blue mirror/grey ones and they'll probably stay in my car since they're ARE polarized.,77954,4
77954,"The transition line does get into your field of vision, but since I lean my head back while driving, it doesn't interfere.",77954,4
77954,They do block UV.,77954,4
77955,"Love the shirt and the material, but it is a little wide.",77955,4
77956,"Nice hat, a shade too big, have ordered hatbands to improve the fit.",77956,4
77957,"shirt fits well and is comfy, logo started to fade but made it look kind of vintage and part of the apocalypse",77957,4
77958,The chain was really short and looked like a choker on me.,77958,4
77958,But other than that I love it.,77958,4
77959,My nephew loves them.,77959,4
77960,"I have a size 13 wide shoe, so buying this made me skeptical.",77960,4
77960,"However, I was not dissapointed.",77960,4
77960,These fit me perfectly.,77960,4
77960,"The only complaints were that it was a day late, and the the little plastic things that are threaded to the sock were a nuisance and made little holes.",77960,4
77960,"Overall, an excellent product and would buy again.",77960,4
77961,"It doesn't hang quite like I expected it to, but I like it.",77961,4
77961,Especially considering what I paid for it.,77961,4
77962,not for infants... your baby should at least be 5 months old,77962,4
77963,"The breast cups of the medium were too small for my DDDs and threaten to let it all hang in one wrong move but, look as expected.",77963,4
77963,It looks great on my wife who is 5'6 - 130 lbs with DDs.,77963,4
77964,Really nice shirt for the price,77964,4
77965,"Good for someone who very rarely ever wears a tux (once a year, at best), but if you need something for multiple occasions, it's probably best to invest in something a little nicer.",77965,4
77967,Cute blouse but the sleeves are a bit tight.,77967,4
77967,Also wouldn't recommend if you are larger than a C or d cup because the chest ares is also snug.,77967,4
77968,very flattering fit as expected material was a little rougher that expected but worked great,77968,4
77969,The product will most likely end up being perfect after I hand wash it.,77969,4
77969,It arrived smelling like mildew.,77969,4
77969,"Other than that, its prettier and more flattering then I expected.",77969,4
77971,These shoes are fantastic.,77971,4
77971,"I decided to try them as a cold weather, rain weather work shoe or a general riding boot.",77971,4
77971,"I have been wearing flat, 0-drop, and barefoot shoes for several years and it is very difficult to find something to fit the bill when it comes to boots.",77971,4
77971,I wear a size 15 or 14 mens wide depending on the manufacture of the shoes.,77971,4
77971,I bought a 14 wide in these.,77971,4
77971,I want a pair for every color they make now.,77971,4
77971,":)  That being said, the vibram sole is great though it is stiffer than the normal barefoot shoe.",77971,4
77972,"These did NOT come as a headband, they came as clip-ons.",77972,4
77972,If you want a headband then you will have to buy a thin metal one from a craft store and clip them to it with the clips it comes attached to.,77972,4
77972,"Since the ears are clip-ons, they will move around through the day (or night) and can shift or fall off.",77972,4
77972,There have been times where one fell off and I didn't know and then I had to go searching for it.,77972,4
77972,"Other than that, the ears are really cute and I like how they look in my hair.",77972,4
77972,I'd buy more ears from the person/seller I got them off of as they were very inexpensive anyway.,77972,4
77972,OH one thing: These are not fox fur!!!,77972,4
77972,They are FAUX fur lol.,77972,4
77973,I love these shoes!,77973,4
77973,They are almost perfect!,77973,4
77973,Because they fit true to size.,77973,4
77973,The heel height really works for me (and my legs ; ).,77973,4
77973,My boyfriend loves them!,77973,4
77973,"The strappy uppers are the right kinda tightness, supportive but comfortable.",77973,4
77973,"I got them in coral so they match my coral and rose dresses, skirts and blouses really well.",77973,4
77973,"They are really pretty, are easy to get in and out of and buckle easily.",77973,4
77973,"Oh, and did I mention my boyfriend loves them?",77973,4
77975,Nice but thought it'd be a little larger,77975,4
77976,Upset that one of my tapers was bent so I couldn't use it but this kit helped me size up quick,77976,4
77977,Great wallet and I like that it fits in my pocket.,77977,4
77978,"the top is a nice piece... the skirt is too tight.but I have an alternate that will work well, and the top alone is worth it.",77978,4
77979,"I like it, its a little bit loose in the upper waist and fits perfectly on the bottom.",77979,4
77979,I wear it to work with a blazer so its not too short.,77979,4
77979,"I'm about 5'4, 122 lbs, size small.",77979,4
77980,I JUST received this dress in the mail and tried it on and it was WAY too big.,77980,4
77980,I usually wear between 12-14 in US women's sizes - bust is 38C.,77980,4
77980,The shoulders were perfect (I have wideish shoulders) but the bust was huge and baggy.,77980,4
77980,"That said the quality is really nice, and OH, MAN I wish it fit.",77980,4
77980,"It's super nice, but I have to return it, and I'm heartbroken!",77980,4
77980,"However, I've ordered the next size down and have my fingers crossed.",77980,4
77980,I NEED it by Halloween!,77980,4
77981,"I paid only $3 for this necklace, and was pleased with the quality.",77981,4
77981,"It does occasionally fall off the chain, but not nearly as much as I expected.",77981,4
77981,It's pretty and fun.,77981,4
77982,Plenty of room even with thick socks!,77982,4
77983,Nice little purse to carry around for the price.,77983,4
77984,"VERY boxy so I washed/dried it hoping it would shrink and it did (shrank quite a bit -went from knee length, I'm 5'1"", to about 5-6 inches above the knee).",77984,4
77985,I ordered a medium as the reviews said the sizing was slightly large.,77985,4
77985,I usually wear a large.,77985,4
77985,The skirt fit great!,77985,4
77985,It's high waisted which is what I love.,77985,4
77985,The outfit received 4 (if I could it would be 4.5 stars) because the crop top fits like a sports bra.,77985,4
77985,"When I tried it on, a little bit of the bottom of my bra was showing.",77985,4
77985,"I wear a 36(DDD), 29, 45.",77985,4
77985,The material is great quality; stitching is well done.,77985,4
77985,"I'll wear a black bandeau underneath the ""crop"" top.",77985,4
77985,"If there is an option to order sizes separately, I would do that.",77985,4
77986,"Beautiful dress, but it runs small.",77986,4
77988,"When the company heard I wasn't fully satisfied with the size of this item, they mailed me another bead (a beautiful owl) to ensure I was happy with my experience with them.",77988,4
77988,What wonderful costumer service with a focus on return business from satisfied jewlery lovers!!,77988,4
77988,"Thank you for my gift, Ninawueen!",77988,4
77989,"Though the fit of this shirt is a bit loose, it does allow room for tucking in and still having movement, but who is going to see your shirt under your tux at a black tie event anyways?",77989,4
77989,People notice the incredible ribbed detail on the front and the matching studs/cufflinks.,77989,4
77989,What got me to love this shirt was the top button has a bit of an elastic pull so that the neck is always comfortable and not strangling you!,77989,4
77989,"I noticed other people had said that when this product arrived, it was the wrong product, opened, dirty, worn, etc... but mine came in brand new with all the pins still in the shirt and everything else in original sealed plastic no problems!",77989,4
77989,"The only problem I have is that the fabric is a blend of polyester and is very thin, but nothing an undershirt can't fix.",77989,4
77989,Overall very good set for the price!,77989,4
77991,"Nice design, fit as expected but somewhat overpriced",77991,4
77992,Very soft but they are just a little small.,77992,4
77992,"Fortunately, they didn't shrink after washing",77992,4
77995,Its a very nice top for work no wow factor but I like it.,77995,4
77996,Item was just as expected.,77996,4
77997,"Very pretty, gave it as a gift and the person loved it!",77997,4
77997,One problem though: The gem seemed to not be attached well.,77997,4
78000,I checked at stores for lace blouses for some time never found one that I liked.,78000,4
78000,Took a chance ordering this one.,78000,4
78000,"Happy with the price, material, style and fit.",78000,4
78000,I wear a size 6 order size 10.,78000,4
78001,I love it but it runs  small,78001,4
78002,It looks just like it does in the picture..but the only thing about it is it wouldn't fit in my ear lol.,78002,4
78003,They are cute AND as big as the photo which is what I wanted!!!,78003,4
78003,Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they are a little more clear than pink.,78003,4
78003,Which I was hoping for.,78003,4
78003,"BUT for price can't beat it, would buy again.",78003,4
78004,Bought this for a birthday present for someone typicallly an XL.,78004,4
78004,Per reading reviews that the shirt ran small to size so I purchased an XXL.,78004,4
78004,The larger size fit perfectly.,78004,4
78004,Thanks for posting the other reviews that advised the size info.,78004,4
78006,"Great fit, easy to nurse while on.",78006,4
78006,But not very supportive.,78006,4
78007,"Packaging could be better, hat was a bit smashed but not bad..",78007,4
78008,Well made and fashionable coat,78008,4
78010,Cute but just a little small,78010,4
78011,"Good fit on this shirt and decent quality material, if a little thin.",78011,4
78011,I got a lot of looks and smiles wearing this shirt and more that a few ladies patting me on the back.,78011,4
78011,It was nice to put a smile on a few faces.,78011,4
78011,...And it doesn't hurt that I have a FREAKING AWSOME WIFE!!,78011,4
78012,"1/2 size too big, returned for larger size",78012,4
78013,"Love this shirt, very surprised by how many people recognize what it was.",78013,4
78014,but they do fit tight at the top on you waist line.,78014,4
78014,You defiantly do not want to wear a tight shirt with these.,78014,4
78014,wear a loose shirt.,78014,4
78017,costume was fine and fit well.,78017,4
78018,Too small but I will give it to somebody.,78018,4
78019,Finally had gotten my package and the quality was great.,78019,4
78020,"Like it a lot, thought it would make a great set when matched with the bracelet and the ring.",78020,4
78020,"The necklace, earrings and bracelet were a perfect match together.",78020,4
78021,Got this for easter and it was a little small because I am large chested... also it got here later than it was supposed to so I didn't get to wear it for easter.,78021,4
78021,But I used it for maternity photos.,78021,4
78022,Love this product's quality however they are more like 16G than 18G.,78022,4
78022,I pierced my ear with a 16G needle and these didn't fit inside the needle and so they were hard to get into the piercing hole.,78022,4
78022,The ball on the back is kinda difficult to get on but that is how all barbell earrings are.,78022,4
78022,Overall I am very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend these earrings to anyone looking for smaller stud earrings.,78022,4
78023,My wife was really happy with the bracelet.,78023,4
78024,This is an attractive band and it appears to be sturdy.,78024,4
78024,It was easy to install on my Asus Zen 2 with the included tool and pins.,78024,4
78025,a little pricey but ok,78025,4
78026,Love the color and material,78026,4
78027,These boots are cool as hell and bada$$ to the max!,78027,4
78027,"I normally wear a size 10 boot, and these fit with just enough extra room for a gel insole...I have a high arch and usually add insoles to my boots...so the fit is just right.",78027,4
78027,"I didn't give them a five star rating because: 1, the zippers on the sides can be very difficult to zip up.",78027,4
78027,"And 2, I've got to question if these are real leather.",78027,4
78027,They have a very plastic and fake feel to them.,78027,4
78027,"But regardless, I can't wait to wear them on tour with my metal band.",78027,4
78028,A decent belt -does what it's supposed to do: hold up your pants.,78028,4
78028,"No need to spend $30+ on a daily staple, I may try to get this same belt in another color.",78028,4
78030,These aren't true to Women's sizes but rather to Junior's.,78030,4
78030,Still a nice quality pant but WAY too snug of a waistband.,78030,4
78030,"I normally buy a 10-12 so I purchased a large and while I can pull them on, they're suffocating.",78030,4
78031,This Necklace is pretty but a little smaller than I thought.,78031,4
78033,"Looks beautiful,
Feels great,
Without forgetting the all important comfort aspect.",78033,4
78033,This is a classically beautiful suit!!,78033,4
78034,This is a great package of gloves.,78034,4
78035,This dress is very pretty and the color is vibrant.,78035,4
78036,Great for under basketball shorts,78036,4
78037,Nice reasonably priced boots!,78037,4
78038,The fabric is a little stiff.,78038,4
78038,But I  like the fit.,78038,4
78039,"Unless you're prepared to iron your robe everything you wash it, you might be disappointed with the way the lining flops out of the front edge of this robe.",78039,4
78039,They didn't bother to stitch it in.,78039,4
78039,It makes no sense.,78039,4
78040,I purchased a size that I thought would fit fine but it was a little snug for my taste.,78040,4
78040,I wore the dress and it was fine just a little tighter than I had expected.,78040,4
78040,Overall it's a cute dress.,78040,4
78040,Just make sure you buy a size bigger than you think you should.,78040,4
78042,"A little more muted in color than expected, but still nice.",78042,4
78042,Gave it as a well-received gift.,78042,4
78043,pretty cool - I have to figure out a way to extend it.,78043,4
78043,"I don't really have a ""big neck"" but the necklace is too tight.",78043,4
78044,These are adorable and good material but come up a little high and makes it difficult to wear with flats,78044,4
78045,Great cross but received with a small hole in center so a little disappointed and no variations as pictured,78045,4
78047,I got these for my office halloween party.,78047,4
78047,Very cute and easy to attach the tail to your pants with a safety pin- the end of the tail has a ribbon that you can use to attach.,78047,4
78048,"I like this hat, it looks pretty nice on and chick.",78048,4
78050,arrived a week early!!,78050,4
78050,"its adorable, im not having any problems with the necklace or the clasp so i'm super happy with my purchase c: perfect for a cat lover or a gift to one",78050,4
78051,really like it very pretty.,78051,4
78055,"I'm an artist & like the parsley design/it's a bit flamboyant in purple,but I bought a blue one also/ good for the price",78055,4
78056,I like:  3 inch elastic waistband that doesn't cur.,78056,4
78056,Zippered front pockets large enough for key case or small wallet.,78056,4
78056,I'm short so particularly like elastic at ankle.,78056,4
78056,"These are soft, warm and comfortable so are fine for my purposes:  lounging around house in fall and winter.",78056,4
78056,"Note, however:  Size runs small.",78056,4
78056,I'm 36 waist and bought Large.,78056,4
78056,"Even so, they ""hug"" my legs are and thighs so restrict fast exercises like running.",78056,4
78056,Wouldn't be good for yoga but would be  o.k.,78056,4
78056,for proper squats and stretching.,78056,4
78057,Super cute and my grand daughter loved these pajamas!,78057,4
78057,"Not quite the quality as I hoped, but nonetheless, would buy again.",78057,4
78058,really love this dress...but it fits a bit snugl,78058,4
78059,I ordered both the black and the orange.,78059,4
78059,"Although I am tall and slender, I ordered the LX, based on the size measurements shown on the size chart.",78059,4
78059,"A Large would have been better, but I can still wear the shirts.",78059,4
78059,"The orange was much brighter than I expected, but it is very attractive.",78059,4
78059,"These shirts are both lightweight polyester, perhaps lighter than I expected, and this fact is my reason for four stars rather than five.",78059,4
78061,"A simple, pretty bracelet with good color to the stones.",78061,4
78061,My only complaint is that it's just a little tight and I don't have large wrists.,78061,4
78061,"Still, it looks great and if it stretches well (as opposed to snapping), I'll probably order others.",78061,4
78062,I really like this shirt a lot.,78062,4
78062,My only complaint is the texture of it.,78062,4
78062,It is kind of a spandex-like texture and I feel like this design would look a lot better with just a cotton plain black texture.,78062,4
78062,The words and design was completely clear with no pixels or anything like that.,78062,4
78062,"I am a 34D and about 150 lbs at 5'8"" and I ordered a size medium and it fits perfectly.",78062,4
78062,It is a spandex material so it does stretch.,78062,4
78062,"Overall, I would probably recommend this shirt.",78062,4
78063,"Love this shirt, but how can you not like anything related to Labyrinth?",78063,4
78063,"Looks great, fits very nicely.",78063,4
78063,"I got a medium and it is form fitting (5'10"", 165lbs).",78063,4
78063,"The back is a little bit see through, which is why I give it a 4/5.",78063,4
78063,"The fabric it is made of is very comfortable, and unlike any t-shirt I've worn.",78063,4
78063,"It is not cotton, and feels like a very thin spandex.",78063,4
78064,"was a little scratchy at first, but after initial wash is better now",78064,4
78065,The length was shorter than I expected and the shirt is true to size!,78065,4
78066,A little see through but their the cutest leggings I've owned.,78066,4
78070,"Great pants, jus didn't quite fit my Phat ass.",78070,4
78071,Such a cute little sun hat!,78071,4
78071,My only complaint is that it kind of wrinkles coming out of the dryer.,78071,4
78071,I now air dry it which helps the side flaps hang straight a little better.,78071,4
78072,This jacket has a flattering shape for my 13 year old.,78072,4
78072,The thing I don't like is the velcro down the front.,78072,4
78072,Bought the small (usually buy xs) after reading the reviews.,78072,4
78073,I loved this top but the large was too small.,78073,4

78075,"Other wise I will gift it to my friend, but i love the shirt and it's very good quality just a little to big

78077,don't wear alone unless you don't mind some of your booty being out.,78077,4
78077,the red stockings that it comes with are SUPER cheap and will rate IMMEDIATELY so I reccomend buying your own or some red leggings to complete the outfit.,78077,4
78078,Arrived quickly and good quality tie for the price and has a very light tie feel comparable to wearing a silk tie.,78078,4
78079,The hat should have more sun protection ot the top of the hat.,78079,4
78079,The sides can remain more open for coolness.,78079,4

78083,I bought this to wear for Halloween.,78083,4
78083,Kept me warm and in costume,78083,4
78084,Nice sturdy coat but some loose threads and was super starchy.,78084,4

78088,I'll order more soon,78088,4
78089,This headband was very gorgeous.,78089,4
78089,The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because one of the stones had fallen out before I even opened the package.,78089,4

78093,I didn't want to spend Luminox- or Victorinox-like money.,78093,4
78093,"For me, this was a solid alternative, especially with its mineral glass face (I'm very happy about that ... at this price one usually only finds polycarbonate, not glass).",78093,4
78093,"I only have three cons, although nothing major.",78093,4
78093,1) Wrist band is too long (I'm not a small guy and I'm using the second-from-closest notch to the watch case); 2) Unnecessarily hefty weight; and 3) LCD/backlit display is cheap ... older technology and easily distorted if you press in the display buttons with a solid effort.,78093,4

78093,Would I buy from this company again?,78093,4
78094,"Great dress, very cute and stylish.",78094,4
78094,"Only complaint is the white/tan of the dress is very see through, so you'll either need to go commando or wear nude under garments.",78094,4
78094,The material of the dress is sturdier than I expected as well.,78094,4
78094,Very well made from what I have looked at so far.,78094,4

78111,It will just fit when he is older ha!,78111,4
78112,I really like this tunic.,78112,4
78112,It's a little snug so I'm worried about washing it.,78112,4
78112,Won't go in the dryer which means ironing.,78112,4
78112,But as long as it doesn't shrink all should be fine.,78112,4
78113,Priced well for the quality.,78113,4
78114,These run small in the calves so more for the younger junior generation but very cute!,78114,4

78116,I would have liked it a bit larger !,78116,4
78116,Otherwise I like the look!,78116,4
78117,"The tag says it's an XL, which fits my daughter like her other shirts which are Juniors large.",78117,4
78117,"I believe because it was made in China, i'm thinking it runs small.",78117,4
78117,"I bought an XL so my daughter would fit in it for awhile, she is 14 and 5 ft 8, she usually wears junior large shirts.",78117,4
78117,But this fits her perfect now.,78117,4
78117,It's really cute too.,78117,4
78117,She gets complimented often.,78117,4

78122,"She's 5'3"", 115lbs, athletic build with a bit of a bottom.",78122,4

78122,"She can wear the Small over her bikini bottoms to swim, or as pajamas...",78122,4
78124,Although the material looks kind of cheap as it is shiny almost like patent leather.,78124,4
78125,I recently got a chance to test this product.,78125,4
78125,It does it's job.,78125,4
78125,This particular cowboy hat has a rancher crown (4 5/8) with a 4 inch brim.,78125,4
78125,"The rain cover over laps and only covers about 2in on the underside, leaving another 2in uncovered..",78125,4
78125,I would prefer it cover the entire brim and therefore I gave it a 4 * rating.,78125,4
78125,I'm glad I got the XL,78125,4
78126,Very cute true to color runs a little small,78126,4
78127,Comfortable to wear and keeps glares from being bothersome while driving.,78127,4
78128,Not for really cold weather.,78128,4
78128,I take it on carry on because I get cold on airplanes.,78128,4
78129,"I like this necklace, it looks a little cheaper than I'd hoped it would.",78129,4
78129,"The chain is too bright, it definitely looks like a costume jewelry chain.",78129,4
78129,The eye of Horus is colorful and sturdy and the size is nice.,78129,4
78129,"I think it looks good from a distance, as most people looking at it would be.",78129,4
78129,"But as I am wearing it, it does not stand up to my close scrutiny, it looks cheap.",78129,4
78129,"I might buy this again, knowing what I know now.",78129,4
78129,"It's a fun nod to Egypt and an unusual, colorful piece to have in my arsenal, but it doesn't begin to pass as anything other than costume jewelry.",78129,4
78130,Very pretty skirt but it is hard to iron/steam to get the pleats into place correctly,78130,4
78131,Great for the money fur Sur.,78131,4
78132,This costume is a great value for a basic costume replica.,78132,4
78132,The little panty shorts probably don't fit anyone over a size 8 comfortably.,78132,4
78132,"The bra piece was a little bit of a squeeze for a C cup, but worked out ok.",78132,4
78132,"Overall, I was happy with what I got.",78132,4
78133,Not too dark and fit over glasses well.,78133,4
78134,"The fabric is a little thin, transparent and small runs a little big, but you can adjust and it is nice , shipping was very fast , I recommend it for the summer.",78134,4
78135,"Received an upright pentacle instead of inverted, returned it but I will order inverted one again.",78135,4
78135,"The quality was still good, just not the right direction :)",78135,4
78136,Love love love my dress.,78136,4
78136,My only issue was the sash doesnt look like the sash in the picture.,78136,4
78136,But no biggie the seller emails you for your measurements and it came alot earlier then expected... Beautiful dress,78136,4
78137,It's good but keep in mind that it goes by Asian sizing.,78137,4
78137,I'm a Small in American sizes but a Medium fits fine.,78137,4
78139,I bought this for my sister and it fit her perfect!!.,78139,4
78139,It arrived pretty fast than expected.,78139,4
78139,I am giving 4 stars because of the zip.,78139,4
78139,It was and still is hard to pull up.,78139,4
78139,Otherwise it is a nice dress!,78139,4
78140,"Like the others said, one side is longer than the other",78140,4
78141,I really loved the pattern and idea of this dress but even the SMALL absolutely swallowed me up!,78141,4
78141,"I mean that it was really, really big and awkward on me so I'm not sure if it was my body type or what.",78141,4
78141,I also wasn't a fan at all of the material but some may like it...a little too stiff for my taste.,78141,4
78141,I do believe this would look great on some women - just wasn't a good fit for me.,78141,4
78141,Seller and overall experience were very pleasant and without incident  so A++ as a whole...,78141,4
78142,Fit perfectly except the bust.,78142,4
78142,Bust was way bigger than expected but every other aspect fit perectly,78142,4
78144,The fur is very nice like the picture.,78144,4
78144,I wished there was more padding behind the fur for your ears.,78144,4
78144,But nothing I can't live without.,78144,4
78144,I love earmuffs in the chilly weather.,78144,4
78145,wish it had a snap or velcro,78145,4
78146,These pants fit well.,78146,4
78146,"As long as purchase, ""petite ""  Have not had any problems with Co.",78146,4
78147,I  purchased this ring after being directed to it by an acquaintance.,78147,4
78147,I  first thought the stone had been enlarged for advertising purposes but was surprised at how nice the ring is.,78147,4
78147,I recently went on a cruise and wore this ring on my small finger and received several compliments.,78147,4
78147,Unfortunately when I bought my ring the sizes were limited but for the price I am very pleased.,78147,4
78147,I  received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,78147,4
78147,The price of the item did not swayed my opinion in any way.,78147,4
78148,This works and keeps my glasses from being knocked off the table,78148,4
78149,Somewhat of a smaller junior fit,78149,4
78150,Great looking but they have a tendency to need adjusting when wearing.,78150,4
78151,The clutch is beautiful and elegant.,78151,4
78151,The two chain straps included looked very cheap and don't go with the bag,78151,4
78152,"Dress fit well,size was perfect but its not as long as pictured.",78152,4
78152,"I'm 5"" 7"" and it hit mid calf",78152,4
78153,Buttons on the inside of the legs click together and make noise when I walk otherwise a great product.,78153,4
78154,"Cute dress, got compliments when I wore it.",78154,4
78154,"Did have to pin the front closed a bit, it was a little to high for me.",78154,4
78155,"actually really well made for the price, money well spent",78155,4
78156,"I bought one size larger than I typically wear, and I should have just ordered my size.",78156,4
78156,"But thankfully it's still wearable, and somewhat adjustable with the tie back!",78156,4
78156,I normally wear a C/D cup and I had room in the cups to fill more.,78156,4
78156,I like the colors.,78156,4
78156,"The material doesn't feel like it will last me years, but it seems like it will last me through several of my upcoming trips as long as I treat it right!",78156,4
78156,"My only worry is that the back might come untied at an inopportune moment, so I might stick a few stitches in there!",78156,4
78156,It was also approved by my kiddo.,78156,4
78157,"Ordered for my son who is fairly skinny, but the Small was way too big for him and not sure XS will work either.",78157,4
78157,"Probably partially my fault for trying to fit him into a men's size, but I had no luck finding anything else he was interested in.",78157,4
78157,"Other than the wrong size, it seems like a good product.",78157,4
78157,I will probably hang on to it and he can use it in the next year or two.,78157,4
78158,It was kinda tight for it to be a medium.. More like an extra small.,78158,4
78159,It is very big !,78159,4
78159,The only thing i didn't like as much was that its kind of hard to read what it says.,78159,4
78159,Other than that its great !,78159,4
78160,Very nice and cute!,78160,4
78160,It is very low cut so I had to wear a lacey camisole underneath it but it was a big hit!,78160,4
78161,"They are not bad, they fit like I wanted it to fit.",78161,4
78161,I just wish the logo was in the chest area but other than that they are good quality.,78161,4
78163,I'm glad I read the reviews that told me that the top would be confusing as heck.,78163,4
78163,"Once I figured it out, it looked pretty sexy.",78163,4
78163,The back is much too big (I wear a 34B/C) and ordered a small.,78163,4
78163,"It has enough extra material that I can actually tie in in a knot to fit, but it looks rather silly from the back.",78163,4
78163,"I will probably sew it together, since the other part wraps around and ties as well.",78163,4
78163,The bottoms are typical string bikini bottoms.,78163,4
78163,"Nothing special, nothing wrong with them.",78163,4
78163,Always a good choice because you can tie them to fit your needs.,78163,4
78163,"The tush is cut narrow, which fits the bill as this is a sexy bikini.",78163,4
78164,may not be ideal for big  DD breasts.,78164,4
78164,Beauty of a bathing suite.,78164,4
78164,"I'm 5'9, no way.",78164,4
78164,Daughter 5'4 no way to fit comfortably torso to neck - to impossible...good stretch on width however.. :) good for big hips..non negotiable on breast area per say..,78164,4
78165,Like the gown but it is a juniors size not womens,78165,4
78167,My daughter looks great in this!,78167,4
78167,And she loves it!,78167,4
78167,It is a bit sheer so it needs a camisole under it.,78167,4
78170,I really like this Industrial.,78170,4
78170,I'm usually not one to change out that particular piercing and have stuck to the original one I have but I'm so happy I decided to give this a try.,78170,4
78170,Buying industrial piercings can be tricky.,78170,4
78170,"I've had this piercing for nearly ten years and in time have forgotten my gauge so it was a bit of a tossup as to whether it'd fit and luckily for me, it did.",78170,4
78170,Also don't forget about then length of your piercing.,78170,4
78170,It's not easy to measure but it's doable otherwise it might not be long enough.,78170,4
78170,Also it is not suggested to change them out until it is healed.,78170,4
78170,I know the temptation for switching piercings but it's really not worth it.,78170,4
78170,The jewelry itself is great.,78170,4
78170,Each ball unscrews so you can insert it which isn't my favorite as it can be a bit tricky and takes longer than my other but in time I'm sure I'll get used to it.,78170,4
78170,Honestly I wanted to give it five stars and debated it but the only reason I didn't was because one of the balls won't show the diamond if you screw it as tight as you can.,78170,4
78170,It was a bit misleading in the picture in that sense as you obviously assume both with show.,78170,4
78170,I'm keeping it anyways and will just make sure the one that won't show is on my hairline since that one is difficult to see anyways so it's not a big deal for me.,78170,4
78170,I tried to not screw it tight but it's just too loose to make me comfortable that I won't lose the ball.,78170,4
78170,"I've had that happen and it can be a pain to replace and in this case, since it's a more specialized one, I'd have to order it a second time so leaving it partially unscrewed isn't an option.",78170,4
78170,"The only other problem I can see someone running into is the actually diamond logo touches the helix, the outside/top portion, of my ear.",78170,4
78170,I don't plan on wearing this consistently but if I did then I imagine the rubbing might irritate it.,78170,4
78170,I've added a few photos to show those two issues for reference and one also of the ball loose that will show both diamonds but all the others show it tight which is why the diamond isn't visible on one end.,78170,4
78170,The negatives aren't a big deal for me but for some might be an issue.,78170,4
78170,"Otherwise, I love this jewelry.",78170,4
78170,It's cute and matches a set of earrings I bought perfectly.,78170,4
78170,I would recommend this for any Harley Quinn fan!,78170,4
78171,"A little larger then I expected, that's why 4 stars instead of 5, however the shirt  itself is great!",78171,4
78171,"The fabric Is soft,and decal is just as advertised I'm very pleased and can't wait for my son to wear it for his birthday.",78171,4
78173,The color is very dark purple I would of preferred the purple that is shown.,78173,4
78174,"More off white and a little thin, but the print is pretty for the price.",78174,4
78175,For the price these are pretty darn nice.,78175,4
78175,"They look good, get the job done.",78175,4
78175,They don't have feel of expensive glasses but i would prefer to have glasses i don't have to get upset when i leave a pair somewhere.,78175,4
78176,Great with jeans or shorts.,78176,4
78176,Very comfortable and the silver is very pretty,78176,4
78177,"THE VENT PANELS UNDER THE ARMS ARE UNRAVELING, BUT IT SHOULDN'T EFFECT THE SHIRT OVERALL.",78177,4
78178,The top is really pretty and I love the way it fits.,78178,4
78178,The pants are sheer and really long and saggy.,78178,4
78178,I am keeping just because of how much I like the top.,78178,4
78179,I purchased this hat for my baby when he was around six months old and we've been using it for the past six months.,78179,4
78179,"He is very fair and we live in Texas, so I knew I needed to get him a sun hat ASAP.",78179,4
78179,I love that it's made with lightweight material and the fit is adjustable.,78179,4
78179,He is a big boy and he still has room to grow in this hat.,78179,4
78179,"It can be tricky to tie the straps together to secure it and it also is tricky to keep dry when you use in a pool because the sides are so floppy, but all in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.",78179,4
78179,"I also love the color, it's neutral and goes with everything.",78179,4
78180,I bought this as a present for my best friend.,78180,4
78180,He likes it just fine.,78180,4
78180,"The quality isn't going to blow you out of the water, but it also won't disappoint you either.",78180,4
78180,The design is cool and much less cheesy than the other options out there.,78180,4
78180,I honestly don't know anyone who actually wears the cartoony cap they put out for HP Lovecraft fans.,78180,4
78180,He's probably turning in his grave right now but it's no big deal.,78180,4
78180,"I'm just going to suffer here for him, while I idolize cats, because that's what he would have wanted for me.",78180,4
78181,Nice jacket but you need to order three sizes smaller.,78181,4
78182,Comes with a narrow.,78182,4
78182,And around the bottom which I didn't expect.,78182,4
78182,"I removed the band, took the pleats out and put a rolled hem in.",78182,4
78182,"Now the blouse hangs perfectly and ""floats"" when I walk.",78182,4
78183,nice for my indian costum,78183,4
78184,Really does fit a lot of stuff.,78184,4
78184,A little tricky to get it shoved under the seat for Spirit Airlines free personal item.,78184,4
78184,"And it doesn't always roll great, but that may be user error!",78184,4
78184,But definitely worth the price.,78184,4
78185,"Liked the dress, but it was much too small than the sizing chart said.",78185,4
78185,"But instead of returning it, I gave it away.",78185,4
78186,Cute& sexy rompers for summer beach vacation.,78186,4
78187,"They're decent enough pants to sleep in, but really should be cheaper.",78187,4
78188,It is a lot smaller than I expected thus the 4 stars.,78188,4
78188,It would be nice to post a picture of child using purse for size reference.,78188,4
78188,Can probably only fit 2 boxes of crayons inside etc.,78188,4
78189,I am a college student and this has worked perfectly for me thus far with one exception.,78189,4
78189,The zippers aren't fantastic.,78189,4
78189,Not horrible...but they do unfasten from time leaving the the bag unzipped on both sides of whatever zipper has failed.,78189,4
78189,"easy enough to fix by dragging the zipper pull all the way to the end, so for this reason, its not perfect, but definitely a decent bag.",78189,4
78190,Everything fit perfectly in the slots and there were some leftover.,78190,4
78190,The only thing I don't quite like is when I have to put an individual bill I struggle to put it in.,78190,4
78190,"Other than that, it was the best purchase I have done.",78190,4
78191,Wish it were just a little bigger.,78191,4
78191,"The picture shows a lot of items, but everything is flat...it will not hold a lipstick tube and your cell phone together.",78191,4
78192,"the top is awesome, the bottom is too big",78192,4
78194,Fits smaller than expected.,78194,4
78195,More of a trunk brief than a boxer brief.,78195,4
78195,"They fit a little low, and are a little snug on my large thighs.",78195,4
78195,Could also use a little more space in the front if you're well endowed.,78195,4
78195,Like the colors though.,78195,4
78196,Ties were not individually packaged as stated.,78196,4
78196,They were good designs though and item came on time.,78196,4
78199,Super cute and very flattering bust was not giggly big.,78199,4
78199,I'm a 13-14 40C and this dress fits perfect.,78199,4
78199,A little  if in the Breast area just closed it with a few stitches and perfect!,78199,4
78199,I got a petticoat to wear u Dee and it makes it super fluffy which I like but didn't really need already really puffy,78199,4
78200,I received the suit today and was super excited to try it on.,78200,4
78200,The bottom part fit perfect but the top part was quite loose.,78200,4
78200,"I think if the straps were adjustable, it would be a better fit because I could adjust it to where I needed it.",78200,4
78200,Not every woman is built the same and aren't always perfectly top and bottom proportional...like myself.,78200,4
78200,"If adjustable straps we're added, it would solve everything.",78200,4
78200,I plan to make the alterations myself but overall the body suit is awesome!,78200,4
78201,I took this to Mexico and it was perfect!,78201,4
78201,Once you get it aired out and unfolded it looks adorable and does the trick.,78201,4
78201,Kept me looking cute and saved me from the sun.,78201,4
78202,This was a gift for my mother for her 60th Birthday.,78202,4
78202,"The color is amazing, the weight is great but it is a bit larger than I had expected.",78202,4
78202,I also wish there were 1 more pocket inside.,78202,4
78202,She was happy and is enjoying using it.,78202,4
78202,Plus the extra room means when she travels her kindle fits inside so she likes that.,78202,4
78203,i don't really like material but just its pretty.,78203,4
78204,"Love this product and I would definitely recommend it
Shiloh",78204,4

78209,"In fact, my husband and I won the best outfit for a couple contest.",78209,4
78209,"After reading other reviews before making the purchase, I decided to give it a shot.",78209,4
78209,Another reviewer reported having problems with the tassels getting tangled.,78209,4
78209,I did not have that issue.,78209,4
78209,The only thing that would have made it perfect is the option of being able to button it.,78209,4
78209,One button would have been great.,78209,4
78209,"That's just a small issue, though and a matter of preference.",78209,4
78210,Estimated delivery dat was the 27th and wee delivered the 23.,78210,4
78210,But are much darker than pictures.,78210,4
78210,I wouldn't so much call them smoky rather than purple.,78210,4
78210,But I got the high light of my favorite color being purple so I still like them.,78210,4
78210,Just much darker than what I wanted.,78210,4
78210,Not bad at all for the price.,78210,4
78210,Great weight to them as well.,78210,4
78211,This necklace is decently nice.,78211,4
78211,The chains are different sized links with a cross at the end of the longest chain.,78211,4
78211,"It's not the fanciest necklace I've ever had, but it's nice.",78211,4
78211,The plastic cross is a little wider than I expected but it's ok.,78211,4
78212,"Normally a med, but ordered an xl.",78212,4
78212,It's still a bit small.,78212,4
78212,"Otherwise love the shirt,  looks great,  and is a decent quality",78212,4
78213,I bought this dress to wear to a gala for work.,78213,4
78213,It fits nicely and the size was great as long as you go by the company's sizing chart.,78213,4
78213,"Careful of your jewelery, though - my bracelet kept getting stuck on the lace!",78213,4
78214,Fit great but do not machine wash!!,78214,4
78214,They tend to curl out at the top making a seam line!,78214,4
78214,They are very comfortable tho.,78214,4
78215,Well received by the new Daddy.,78215,4
78216,Don't understand your question about arch support.,78216,4
78216,"This product has nothing to do with that,",78216,4
78217,I don't really have a large butt but my crack or my entire cheeks hang out if I cover my crack...,78217,4
78217,So maybe I should of gotten a bigger size,78217,4
78218,"Material is forgiving, thicker than expected, and very comfortable.",78218,4
78219,I would order again.,78219,4
78219,Amazon does a good job.,78219,4
78220,"I like the design and size of this bag, but it needed something in the bottom to help the bag sit up by itself.",78220,4
78220,It just wants to fall over when you sit it down.,78220,4
78221,These really helped to make me feel more secure post c-section in the weeks of recovery.,78221,4
78222,Pretty and very comfortable!,78222,4
78223,"Bought this sweater for my dad for Christmas and though he hasn't opened it yet, I'm confident it's point for my book!",78223,4
78223,"He's so hard to buy for but when I saw this, I knew he'd enjoy wearing this during the chilly days or nights in.",78223,4
78223,It's a nice change in his plain sweatshirt collection and adds a bit of fun in his mostly blank wardrobe.,78223,4
78223,"The only reason why I gave four stars instead of five is because paying almost thirty dollars for a sweatshirt goes against almost every grain in my body, but that's definitely just a personal thing.",78223,4
78223,The material feels sturdy and I'm hoping he can wear this for many Christmas' in the future!,78223,4
78224,I love Carhartt pants; they're comfortable and mostly long wearing.,78224,4
78224,However I'm disappointed that I can only find my size under the men's sizes.,78224,4
78224,"I know Carhartt carries womens jeans but the quality just isn't the same and they don't seem to go any larger than a 38"" hip.",78224,4
78224,I'm willing to pay brand name prices for these because I know they're durable but is it too much to ask to take the mens carpenter pants and add a little bit of ease in the hip?,78224,4
78224,Leave everything else the way it is but just make it easier for women to wear.,78224,4
78224,"Either that or make mens and womens sizing the same by putting the waist, hip and inseam in inches in the description instead of a single vague, arbitrary number.",78224,4
78226,This material has some stretch to it.,78226,4
78226,"A bit long for me (5'4"") I had to hem them.",78226,4
78226,Would appreciate if they were offered in different lengths,78226,4
78227,I am a 3X.,78227,4
78227,(Size 24\26 jeans Hip to hip I measured myself at 28.),78227,4
78227,"I bought this in a 4X and it fits ""VERY SNUG"".",78227,4
78227,"(I may lose a few more pounds before wearing it in public) I bought it to wear, as a guest to a wedding.",78227,4
78227,"It is 100% super cute, good thick material.",78227,4
78227,I also bought a petticoat to add that 50's flare to the bottom which really makes it pop.,78227,4
78227,But if you have a 3X body you need to consider your arms are fully exposed.,78227,4
78227,Im going to try and find a black half jacket or something because a sweater would ruin the beauty of this dress.,78227,4
78227,Overall for me it was a good buy.,78227,4
78228,"This is a lovely alternative to real leather, which I find too heavy for a purse.",78228,4
78228,"It is soft and natural looking, has both handles and shoulder strap and is the right size for me.",78228,4
78228,I would have given it five stars if it had internal dividers to help keep the contents better organized.,78228,4
78228,"Overall, it's a good value.",78228,4
78229,This jacket is simply wonderful.,78229,4
78229,It is unbelievably warm and soft.,78229,4
78229,It's perfect for hiking or camping on colder days or even walking around town.,78229,4
78229,The look works for many occasions.,78229,4
78229,"It is well-made, and the lining is very nice.",78229,4
78229,I would highly recommend this jacket for anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors.,78229,4
78229,I give this jacket 4 out of 5 stars because the color is a bit odd.,78229,4
78229,"A reviewer on another website felt that it ""looked dirty"", which I can understand.",78229,4
78229,"It is not a true cream color, but has a hint of gray added to it.",78229,4
78229,"While the color is not perfect, the jacket serves its purpose very well.",78229,4
78230,Comfortable and look good other than they feel a bit big.,78230,4
78230,I chose this size due to my 10&1/2s are just a bit snug.,78230,4
78231,Hat was somewhat small.,78231,4
78231,Shorts & top fit as expected.,78231,4
78232,"Overall comfortable, but big.",78232,4
78233,Looking forward to using this while traveling.,78233,4
78233,Very nice size and features for flying.,78233,4
78233,Only down side is the strap is made of very slick material and so it slides off your shoulder very easy.,78233,4
78233,It needs the addition of a section of the strap that is made of a no slip material.,78233,4
78234,Fits and wears well.,78234,4
78235,This was advertised as leather.,78235,4
78235,I don't believe it to be real leather.,78235,4
78235,"The leather feels light and of cheaper quality, however, still a nice bracelet for the money.",78235,4
78236,I got the red in medium for valentines day.,78236,4
78236,I am giving this 4 stars because the quality could be better but it is ultimately realistic when considering the price.,78236,4
78236,I could see it lasting a few uses.,78236,4
78236,It looks great on.,78236,4
78236,I can see my tattoo through the skirt.,78236,4
78236,I'll be getting nude underwear to fix that and smooth out some thigh areas.,78236,4
78236,I read others reviews about sizing.,78236,4
78236,Going a size smaller than what you typically wear.,78236,4
78236,I am a large.,78236,4
78236,Wouldn't have gone ANY smaller and glad I didn't.,78236,4
78236,It fit a little snug bit comfortable still!,78236,4
78236,Still a sure show stopper to knock my husband socks off.,78236,4
78237,For the cost it is not a bad purse at all.,78237,4
78237,"The zippers can sometimes feel tough to zip up, but other than that I really have no complaints.",78237,4
78237,I have had quite a few compliments on it too.,78237,4
78237,I added a little FunkoPop keychain Maleficent to mine lol seemed to make it even more awesome.,78237,4
78239,Great top - the colors are placed well for a slimming effect.,78239,4
78239,The bust and belly area are a bit tight.,78239,4
78239,I'm a size 8 and the medium was tight.,78239,4
78239,Otherwise a very good workout top,78239,4
78241,"Fabric is good, recommended",78241,4
78242,I like the looks of this jacket but had to go up a size so that I could use layers under the jacket.,78242,4
78242,I bought for a trip to Ireland.,78242,4
78243,A good heavyweight buckle with good color,78243,4
78244,"Very comfy, understated dress.",78244,4
78245,Loved the coat just wish it ad a hat,78245,4
78247,4/5 because it is quite short... Can't bend over,78247,4
78249,Did not fit as I hoped.,78249,4
78249,Had to send it back.,78249,4
78250,I like this shirt expect that the fabric could be a littler thicker.,78250,4
78251,They were a little smaller than expected but he was still able to wear them.,78251,4
78252,These fit my son well in the waist but were a little longer than I expected.,78252,4
78252,Other than that very happy with these he has worn them at the beach and in the pool.,78252,4
78252,With use and laundering they have not had any fading nor holes or tares.,78252,4
78253,"Thought the hype and reviews about these were a bit much, but as soon as I slipped them on I understood.",78253,4
78253,Fabric feels awesome and they're super comfortable.,78253,4
78253,Just did a 12 mile hike this weekend and forgot I was wearing them.,78253,4
78253,"Only complaints are the pouch could be a bit better formed -- My Pakage is better -- and price is too high -- I got lucky and grabbed a few pairs that were priced at $20, wouldn't pay $30.",78253,4
78254,"Toddler size, too small for my 8 year old",78254,4
78256,"I like the pyjamas, they are nice.",78256,4
78256,The size is as expected.,78256,4
78257,The fabric is nice-but suspect it will require a cami underneath,78257,4
78259,"The color, vermillion red, is as shown in photos.",78259,4
78259,"I am 5 ft tall, 130 lbs, and usually wear 36B bra and US size 6.",78259,4
78259,I got a size 10 based on the website's sizing (not Amazon's).,78259,4
78259,"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that the armhole is too large and the neckline is too low, but nothing that you can't sew together for a perfect fit.",78259,4
78259,"I am wearing 4 inch heels in the photos and you could see that it is still way too long.... but hey, I am a petite woman so I expected that.",78259,4
78259,I'll have it hemmed professionally and I'll have a dress that makes me feel stunning and sexy.,78259,4
78259,I can't wait to wear it for my boyfriend's annual gala.,78259,4
78260,"Fits just fine, worth's the price.",78260,4
78261,"I was hoping it would be a more bodybuilder friendly of a shape, but it's kinda the same as any other tshirt.",78261,4
78261,Baggy waist and normal chest.,78261,4
78261,The arms are slightly tapered in to pronounce arms I think.,78261,4
78261,"No real comment on it, but it's interesting.",78261,4
78263,Fit perfect at a great price,78263,4
78264,I love how it looks when I'm wearing the dress.,78264,4
78264,I love how its see through on the sides so you can show off if your wearing panties or nothing at all,78264,4
78265,"love these pants, good work pants or to wear casually.",78265,4
78265,they do fit small so whatever your waist size is go up about 2 sizes.,78265,4
78266,"Even though it is somewhat small, there's a remedy; I'm losing inches.",78266,4
78266,"By the time I need to wear it, it will definitely be a perfect fit.",78266,4
78266,It is beautiful and looks very classy.,78266,4
78267,This jacket is fantastic.,78267,4
78267,"However, I didn't see anywhere that this jacket had false pockets.",78267,4
78267,I was rather disappointed at this discovery.,78267,4
78267,I'm also concerned about the buttons because they seem rather cheap(afraid these might break off over time) I guess time will tell.,78267,4
78267,"Don't let that discourage you from buying though, this jacket was still a fantastic buy.",78267,4
78267,The material allows comfort no matter what season.,78267,4
78268,"It's a bit big at the bust (but I'm an A-cup...so that's not surprising lol)
All in all it's a pretty good dress for the price!",78268,4
78269,They loved they gift,78269,4
78270,They are excellent in comparison to the selling price,78270,4
78271,Fits slightly small but still wearable for me.,78271,4
78271,Nice blend of fabrics has worn and washed well so far.,78271,4
78271,"A good choice for the money in color, style, fit, and quality.",78271,4
78272,I bought these for my niece.,78272,4
78272,I was very pleased with it quality for the priceI'd guess it was worth more than what I paid.,78272,4
78272,"I wanted to get my young niece something pretty, but wasn't sure how well she would take care of it because of her age, so the price was perfect for this set.",78272,4
78272,"When it arrived, I was impressed with how nice it seemed.",78272,4
78272,"The stones are tiny, but very sparkly.",78272,4
78272,I'd definitely suggest it.,78272,4
78272,"If you have found my review helpful in any way, I would greatly appreciate your up vote as helpful.",78272,4
78273,"petty good, I have not been able to test it yet.",78273,4
78273,I have found that the leather is a bit slippery making it hard to grasp and retrieve from my pocket.,78273,4
78273,I like the individual card slots.,78273,4
78274,Made well but small I wear mediun and this el was small I  contacted commpany but got no response on refund yet,78274,4
78275,Definitely made from cheap metal but I knew that from the price.,78275,4
78275,Fit just fine and I keep them clean so no tarnish or discoloration,78275,4
78276,Had to replace the belt that came with it because it was very cheap looking.,78276,4
78277,You have to make sure you use Asian measurements.,78277,4
78277,I'm a M in US sizes I got an XL but I would have been good with a L it's a bit baggy but hoodies are ment to be baggy.,78277,4
78277,I love this hoodie I would recommend this to any BTS fan,78277,4
78278,This arrived with the picture centered but not as crisp as in the product photo.,78278,4
78278,This is to be expected given the material and is not a big issue.,78278,4
78278,"There is a purple cast to the picture, though, that is not really what I expected and is why I rate with only 4 stars.",78278,4
78278,I have attached a picture so others can better appreciate what they are buying.,78278,4
78279,A little looser than I expected.,78279,4
78279,I thought it would be too small.,78279,4
78279,Good quality and nice color.,78279,4
78281,"I listened to the comments and got one size bigger than i am, and it fits perfect!",78281,4
78282,"Nice product,  great that I can adjust the latches as I drop pounds",78282,4
78283,This was a beautiful skirt but way too small for me.,78283,4
78283,I was surprised as  I'm 5'3 and weigh 107.,78283,4
78284,It was cute just a little smaller than expected.,78284,4
78286,"Look real nice, was on time I have been wearing them for a week no color change will order again",78286,4
78287,"Only thing was, the dress was very wrinkled because of the packaging , but other than that, 10 out of 10!",78287,4
78288,"I really like this colorful sweater, although I would definitely wear a cami/tank under it.",78288,4
78288,"It's pretty flimsy on its own, and I can tell it's not an item that will last years and years.",78288,4
78288,"The price was pretty reasonable, and you can definitely tell why.",78288,4
78289,awesome graphics - a bit small,78289,4
78290,The hook is a little smaller then I expected so I had to maneuver it a bit to get the purse on but that's easily fixed by putting the purse on the hook first then hanging it on the table so no big deal.,78290,4
78290,The hooks themselves are very nice and the butterfly detail is cute.,78290,4
78290,All in all a good buy for the price.,78290,4
78291,"Top is ok. A little tight but I have a big back so that's ok and too large at the bottom, it's like wearing my granny's panties",78291,4
78292,Even on a curvy body!,78292,4
78293,"Just the color I was looking for, but the gloves were a little too long in the fingers.",78293,4
78295,I'm usually a small or an small in dresses and i got a medium and it has about the same fit,78295,4
78296,"Nice and stylish,  but size was off a little bit.",78296,4
78297,I brought this for my son.,78297,4

78297,Happy with the purchase it is pretty.,78297,4
78298,Fit is just right,78298,4
78299,The eyeglass holder is a great idea for someone like me who always looses their glasses.,78299,4
78299,It protects them too with the soft furry lining.,78299,4
78299,It's big enough for my small/medium size eyewear but don't know if it would fit large glasses.,78299,4
78300,Liked it a lot!,78300,4
78302,Purposely baught smaller size due to this being stretchy and prior reviews.,78302,4
78302,"I'm 5'4 and typically a size 12 pants, 8-10 top and weigh 190 lbs.",78302,4
78302,the dress is really cute and can't wait to wear it out.,78302,4
78302,The bottom fits perfect but the top is somewhat snug.,78302,4
78302,It seems it will be nice with heels or flats which I also a plus too.,78302,4
78303,This is a cheap plastic sliper.,78303,4
78303,I got it to wear it around the house as additional isolation layer from the cold floors during the winter.,78303,4
78303,And as such they do good job.,78303,4
78303,"I do not expect much of it, it already paid itself off in wearing around the house.",78303,4
78304,They are very comfortable and true to size.,78304,4
78304,"I walk and move around all day long at my job, and these shoes are just perfect, very comfortable.",78304,4
78305,This is a really cute hat for summer.,78305,4
78305,Its breathable although a bit stiff.,78305,4
78305,Suited its purpose as a summer hat for specific outfits and outings,78305,4
78306,the very top piece which is the sprayer actually fell off and i was a bit upset,78306,4
78307,The fit is good.,78307,4
78307,Good price and comfortable.,78307,4
78308,Can't slouch otherwise ok.,78308,4
78309,I'm about 5 9' and I thought that I would get a large because the reviews said it was slightly smaller.,78309,4
78309,"(But I usually get a medium) I am satisfied with this, but I thought it would be a little longer.",78309,4
78309,It barley covers my butt.,78309,4
78309,However If you just wear leggings it should be fine.,78309,4
78310,A little big in sizing,78310,4
78311,"I love the print on this tank top, and this is the second one I've purchased from Friendly Oak (lovely designs).",78311,4
78311,Only problem is the seams around the arm and neck are already unraveling - and I've only worn it once or twice.,78311,4
78311,"So not sure how long this tank will actually last, I guess we'll see.",78311,4
78312,looks great with jeans,78312,4
78313,"The fit is slightly larger than I expected, but I don't mind because the material tends to cling more than I like.",78313,4
78313,Stays up even during jumping or running in the water.,78313,4
78313,"Shorts are a bit longer, which I liked as well..good to cover up big thighs!",78313,4
78314,Bought this for my daughter.,78314,4
78314,"She likes it, but its somewhat small...doesn't fit as slouchy as pictured.",78314,4
78315,"Not the material I was hoping for, but I guess it's okay.",78315,4
78316,"So far, the only thing I have to say is that I thought they would be a little bigger, other then that they are good.",78316,4
78317,"I read the reviews, thank you!, that it ran on the small side so I ordered a size larger for my daughter who is tall and thin.",78317,4

78319,The only problem was a few of the hand sewn on jewels were loose.,78319,4
78320,I ordered this little dress in size XS and it fits as an XS small would.,78320,4
78320,"The dress, on me, hits me just a few inches below where the end of the dress hits the model's legs and I am 4' 9 inches tall.",78320,4
78320,This dress really works for petite women and it's easy to wear and not see-through at all.,78320,4
78320,It does bunch a bit at the waist but this is due to the elastic and the overall designed look of the dress.,78320,4
78320,This dress can be dressed up or dressed down.,78320,4
78320,"Looks great with a lightweight blazer/cover up, necklace, and high heeled sandal shoes.",78320,4
78320,"Excellent value, especially for the price!",78320,4
78321,I love love love these little outfits!,78321,4
78321,They are soft and adorable!,78321,4
78321,"I ordered in preemie size, my baby was 4lbs.",78321,4
78321,They were too big at first and are larger than all his other preemie clothes.,78321,4
78321,He's now 6lbs and they fit perfect!,78321,4
78322,This fits pretty much as expected only just a slight slight bit smaller.,78322,4
78322,"It adjusted well to my contours and you can tighten it just the way you want for your bust, waist, hips, and love handles.",78322,4
78324,They separated at the seams just trying them on- they looked amazing but the quality was lacking in the pair I received.,78324,4
78325,Very cute and great quality.,78325,4
78325,"Although the size chart is not accurate, the dress is very big on my daughter.",78325,4

78332,I ordered small and they fit as expected.,78332,4
78332,"Not a great quality, of course I didn't expect a Victoria secret for 10 bucks :)",78332,4
78333,Ran a marathon in them and the fit was great.,78333,4
78333,Hopefully just as good for longer runs than that.,78333,4
78334,Could use some pockets.,78334,4
78335,I ordered a size up to be sure.,78335,4
78335,Color is as pictured!,78335,4
78336,Love It will order some more Colors.,78336,4
78338,Material is stretchy so it's form fitted.,78338,4
78338,I'm 5'3 125lbs I got a SMALL and it fits well.,78338,4
78339,"I have several dresses of this brand, but this one was a little on the small side.",78339,4
78339,Beautiful and classy dress but order at least a size or two up.,78339,4
78339,I usually wear a 0-2 (and small chested) and the size 4 fit but was not a comfortable fit at all.,78339,4
78340,It is lightweight and thin like most cotton clothing.,78340,4
78340,"However, a slip underneath takes care of any visible lines.",78340,4
78341,Bought this as a gift; my Mother really loved it.,78341,4
78342,Didn't hang right so I made it an ankle bracelet looks good,78342,4
78343,I have received a lot of compliments on this over the past couple of weeks and it is really cute.,78343,4
78343,"I am 5'4"", 148lbs, and kind of pear shaped (typically wear a size 10 pants).",78343,4
78343,I ordered the large and it fit perfect.,78343,4
78343,"It comes to about my fingertips, so if I were any taller or larger, it probably would be too short.",78343,4
78343,"I gave it 4 stars because it does have a lot of strings hanging off here and there that I had to cut off, but for the price, the quality is as expected- mediocre.",78343,4
78343,I am happy with this purchase and would recommend it to others.,78343,4
78343,The length from top to bottom of the large is approx.,78343,4
78343,"29"" and the width is around 20.5 inches.",78343,4
78345,"Good for the purpose, a little see through",78345,4
78347,"Knew it ran small, so ordered one size up and it fits perfect.",78347,4
78347,Wore over a lacy long slip and got so many great compliments.,78347,4
78347,Really cute summer dtess with strappy sandals!,78347,4

78348,"Makes anyone look incredible, but there was slight bents on the part where the nose is supposed to be placed.",78348,4
78349,A little bigger than most but great coach product.,78349,4
78350,They are a great product.,78350,4
78350,You just have to be mindful they don't fall out,78350,4
78351,"I got these for a Halloween costume

The blue color looks spot on with the picture.",78351,4
78351,Its a perfectly nice little necklace.,78351,4
78351,"I thought the chain was a little long for my taste, but you can force the clasp through the other links to adjust the fit.",78351,4
78351,"Im hoping to fit it into my regular accessory rotation, its a great color and shape.",78351,4
78352,"The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I had to exchange it for a size down, and even then it didn't look exactly like the picture however it still such a wonderful dress.",78352,4
78352,"I'm 5' 5'' and 145lbs, I fist ordered the medium and it was really baggy on me.",78352,4
78352,The material feels pretty thick but is very stretchy so it's super comfortable.,78352,4
78352,Also it's you are under 6ft you can be expected to either hem about 3 inches off the bottom or wear heels.,78352,4
78352,The colors are all super vibrant and it's perfect for summer :) All in all I really do love this dress and the company was so kind and very fast about exchanging the dress for a different size.,78352,4
78352,Honestly the biggest hassle was getting to the post office to send it out!,78352,4
78353,"The only thing I have to say about it is that it wears off easily and by that, I mean the tab that has the magnetic part starts to fall apart after a while but of course because you are constantly opening and closing your case.",78353,4
78353,"I super glued it back but other than that,  its great and cute",78353,4
78354,I like it for the price.,78354,4
78354,Can compliment many outfits.,78354,4
78355,"I really like this blouse, but was surprised to see that it's see-through.",78355,4
78355,You'll have to buy something to wear underneath unless you want your bra and bulges (if any) showing through very easily.,78355,4
78355,The photo is deceptive in that you can't see through the shirt the model is wearing.,78355,4
78355,"It's still a very nice blouse, though.",78355,4
78355,"If you're willing to buy just an inexpensive tank top in a darker blue color, it's perfect!",78355,4
78355,That's what I did and I'm going to wear it a lot.,78355,4
78355,I've already had several compliments on the beautiful blue color.,78355,4
78356,Gift for a friend and they liked them all.,78356,4
78357,The scarf is a little narrow but is warm and soft.,78357,4
78358,Why don't they make 1/2 sizes for a better fit?,78358,4
78358,They really grip any surface and keep older people safe from slippery floors.,78358,4
78359,Very BOHO and comfy.,78359,4
78359,"However, be VERY careful how you launder it.",78359,4
78359,"My husband dried it and the lace shrunk, now the slip hangs out.",78359,4
78359,Just don't dry it and you should be fine.,78359,4
78360,"Cute, but doesn't fit perfect, would have to tailor it.",78360,4
78361,Gorgeous dress - the color is darker than in the picture - a deep royal blue color.,78361,4
78362,"Don't go completely around my nose so you can see the end of it, but great colors",78362,4
78363,Protect it from water...It will fall apart...,78363,4
78364,It's cute but not worth the price I paid.,78364,4
78365,Good quality but some stitches a lil loose,78365,4
78366,Previously ordered XXL and I am usually a 12-14.,78366,4
78366,"The XL fits nicely, not too tight.",78366,4
78366,Belt is cheap & too small.,78366,4
78366,Had to wear one I already had.,78366,4
78367,"Good, but boob cups are close together.",78367,4
78367,This is for small people--children,78367,4
78369,"Well constructed, good material, nice loose fit through the legs and rear.",78369,4
78369,Only wish they were flared more for boots.,78369,4
78371,"I ordered a small, the top is kinda small (I wear a 34D) but manageable and the skirt was only a little bigger than I like in the waist (I wear a 3/4, plus I don't have a big butt to fill it out) I had to take it in a little so it wouldn't fall down.",78371,4
78371,Nonetheless I still love it.,78371,4
78373,"Good looking hat, but the size is off.",78373,4
78373,I measured my head and the chart listed it as large.,78373,4
78373,I probably could have used a medium.,78373,4
78373,Now I have to put a sizer inside so it fits right.,78373,4
78375,Ok but order 1 or 2 sizes bigger than normal,78375,4
78377,Run a little big.,78377,4
78379,teen loves these and bonus to have 3 pairs for when one gets lost,78379,4
78380,I really liked the fit and color.,78380,4
78383,Pretty good but in Saudi Arabia money like 100 riyal doesn't put perfect because wallat a little bit small,78383,4
78384,"Even though the item was too small, they worked with me to resolve the issue.",78384,4
78385,I love Cartel Ink's Tees I just wish they were a little longer.,78385,4
78385,"Other than that the shirt is a thin soft cotton which I love, especially for the summer weather!",78385,4
78386,"It doesn't glow as strongly as I expected it to, but it's a nice dark blue glow, and the design is elegant enough that I can feel confident wearing it to work.",78386,4
78387,"These are really good shoes, and I hope that they last quite awhile.",78387,4
78387,"They are comfortable right out of the box, and look really good.",78387,4
78387,"Plus, they are made right here in the USA.",78387,4
78387,I only gave 4 stars because I do not know about their longevity.,78387,4
78387,"If they last, I will update in the future.",78387,4
78388,Great Service and Product,78388,4
78390,I've ordered this dress for my daughter and she love the material and color.,78390,4
78390,And we received two days after it was shipped which was very fast.,78390,4
78390,"But when we receive it, the dress was too long and large on the bust.",78390,4
78390,It's easy to fix so I'm not worried about that but all in all I'm very pleased with the dress other than the size being a bit off.,78390,4
78390,I'm very pleased with the customer service they replied to any message I've sent in a fast and timely manner.,78390,4
78392,Unfortunately the cut accentuates my back-fat.,78392,4
78392,But it does have good tummy control!,78392,4
78393,"I received these about a week ago, to replace a pair of backings on antique diamond earrings that kept falling off.",78393,4
78393,They fit well and are substantially more secure than normal backings.,78393,4
78393,That said they are not perfect - one popped off in a dressing room last weekend after getting caught on my scarf.,78393,4
78393,"It was a substantial tug though, so I felt it right away and found the backing easily.",78393,4
78395,They get wet really easily but they look and feel nice,78395,4
78396,"Nice, same as inpic",78396,4
78397,I like this piece but it is very heavy.,78397,4
78398,The dress is not a Women's 3xl more of a Junior's 3XL.,78398,4
78398,The colors and quality are very nice though just was too small.,78398,4
78399,I really love the colour of this dress.,78399,4
78399,The shape/style/fit is exactly as expected based on the photos and the other reviews.,78399,4
78399,It was really just a matter of choosing which colour to get.,78399,4
78399,Might have to order more so that I can decide which one is best!,78399,4
78400,I like my purchase.,78400,4
78400,this is comfortable I usually wear size 8 and I have ordered S.,78400,4
78401,It's a beautiful swimsuit the pattern and color are excatly pictured.,78401,4
78401,Only complaint is that I ordered an LX and the bottoms fit perfect but I'm a 32C and the top is pretty big but I'll definitely still wear it.,78401,4
78401,If I had to guess I would say the top is about a 36C to a D but I love it anyways.,78401,4
78403,Exactly as pictured and what you would expect.,78403,4
78403,"Ordered a bunch of rings to find my wedding ring, and I went with another product.",78403,4
78404,have been using these for several years.,78404,4
78404,They keep me out of surgery for plantar faciitis for the time being.,78404,4
78405,very soft and high quality!,78405,4
78405,feels similiar to silk.,78405,4
78405,"If you want a loose-fit like the model image, order a size up.",78405,4
78405,It's also not as long as pictured!,78405,4
78405,I usually wear xs but mine was a little snug at the shoulders.,78405,4
78405,"Overall, it's a very nice shirt.",78405,4
78406,I am 180 pounds and the large is way to big in the tummy.,78406,4
78406,"Other than that, I was please.",78406,4
78408,Adorable and good quality.,78408,4
78409,I have three pairs by this brand but my only problem is they tend to stretch out and become to big in the waist so I suggest buying a size smaller,78409,4
78410,"Beautiful, but kind of cheap.",78410,4
78410,I messed two of them up just by pulling them from the adhesive sheet.,78410,4
78410,"But overall, they'll get the job done and they were really inexpensive so I guess I've ultimately gotten what I paid for.",78410,4
78411,Nice pattern and great for cost.,78411,4
78411,The underlying tank slightly small.,78411,4
78412,But the size is a Little larger than we expected.,78412,4
78412,"But, is ok. My sister could use another thin sweater inside the coat.",78412,4
78413,THIS SCARF IS OK AND USEFUL,78413,4
78414,My daughter loves these shoes.,78414,4
78414,Shy typically wears a size 13/1.,78414,4
78414,I purchased a 1 hoping that they would fit.,78414,4
78414,We ended up returning (which was very easy to do) and getting a size 3!,78414,4
78414,She probably could have even got a 4.,78414,4
78414,So in my opinion and case they run very small.,78414,4
78414,They seem to be somewhat well made but do look a little cheap.,78414,4
78414,I would recommend them though as they are cute and she thinks they are very comfortable.,78414,4
78414,"I would recommend getting at least 1 size up, maybe even 2.",78414,4
78415,I purchased these with a gift certificate I earned by reviewing software.,78415,4
78415,"I've worn these nearly daily since I bought them, and I really do like them.",78415,4
78415,For the price ($9.99) they are really great.,78415,4
78415,They won't replace your $100 brand name sunglasses.,78415,4
78415,"I use them for running around out in the woods, or in any situation where I have a good chance of breaking them or losing them.",78415,4
78415,"They are quite dark, though not so dark that it's hard to see under normal daytime conditions.",78415,4
78416,The sweatshirt is super cute.,78416,4
78416,I wear a S in tops normally.,78416,4
78416,"I ordered a M for the sweatshirt, so I can layer.",78416,4
78416,The M fits like a S and I won't be able to wear much underneath it.,78416,4
78416,"Still, very happy with the sweatshirt.",78416,4
78418,"I bought my SD this shirt and went 2 sizes bigger so it fit baggie, she where's a medium so if you want baggie I would go 2 sizes larger since it's China sizes.",78418,4
78418,It is see through but super soft and comfy.,78418,4
78419,fine for the stadium of beach.,78419,4
78420,Perfect for my African Safari in May,78420,4
78421,It is very difficult to find comfortable cotton underwear and these are just what I was looking for.,78421,4
78422,"Arm sleeves runs small, but overall, comfortable and beautiful!",78422,4
78423,"The quality is fabulous, but the size was small.",78423,4
78423,I am waiting for my refund on the return.,78423,4
78424,"They look nice, and I haven't had any problems with them.",78424,4
78424,One of the earrings was oxidized or something on the pointy end as it had turned brown.,78424,4
78424,It seems to be fine though.,78424,4
78425,Worth the buy- Thanks for a great shirt for supporting a great man!,78425,4
78426,I am very satisfied with the fit and the colors.,78426,4
78426,The embroidered lace trim will probably not hold up after washing but that can be replaced.,78426,4
78426,But for the price it is great!,78426,4
78428,Definitely great for protection.,78428,4
78429,"The clasp can be stubborn to undo, especially before broken in.",78429,4
78429,There were a couple times I wondered if the belt would become undone!,78429,4
78429,After a few months it loosened up and came undone easily.,78429,4
78430,The fabric is a bit cheap but I bought it for my daughter's science student boyfriend.,78430,4
78430,He seemed pleased with it.,78430,4
78432,Too sexy i live it,78432,4
78433,"First off, my dress was shipped to the wrong address, which gave me a heart attack for a second.",78433,4
78433,But the dress overall is beautiful; I love the skirt material.,78433,4
78433,The sleeves were a bit large for me and the buttons in the back  that held the top together kind of scared me because they weren't that strong (If yours is too small it would be very easy for the buttons to come undone but other than that I love it!,78433,4
78434,The sleeves are a bit short and I am a petite woman .. i do not have long arms .. yet the arms are a bit short.,78434,4
78434,"I did get a small so if you want the arms to be longer, get a size bigger than what you wear.",78434,4
78435,delivered and as described,78435,4
78436,Really adorable owl earrings.,78436,4
78436,They are very comfortable to wear.,78436,4
78436,They were smaller than I thought they would be.,78436,4
78437,Would have given 5 stars if they had sent the bottoms.,78437,4
78437,But it works great as a shirt.,78437,4
78437,"Good material, especially if you are large chested as I am.",78437,4
78437,Well worth the money even as is.,78437,4
78438,Worked well for my trip to Europe.,78438,4
78438,Obviously for the price this isn't a long-term wallet but worked for what I needed!,78438,4
78440,"I was nervous ordering a costume online, but it's perfect!",78440,4
78440,"The fit is great, quality is decent for the price.",78440,4
78440,My only complaint are the gloves.,78440,4
78440,"They aren't as long as pictures, so fits fairly awkward.",78440,4
78440,It's nothing you can't work around though.,78440,4
78441,Very nice addition to your summer wardrobe!,78441,4
78442,"Ok top, but a little long.",78442,4
78442,The top stitching is pretty.,78442,4
78443,"Works well when you want something feminine, but not dressy.",78443,4
78445,Love the print and that its water resistant.,78445,4
78445,"It is a bit large for my laptop though, which surprised me since my computer is 17"" (fairly large).",78445,4
78445,I've been using the case/cover for 6 months now and it's held up very well (I travel with it everyday)!,78445,4
78446,"Was exactly how it was described on the website
The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the band is small.",78446,4
78446,My husband is about 8.5 band and this fit him snug.,78446,4
78448,Material is nice but cut very small - have to send it back.,78448,4
78449,"Awsome watch looks great works great only thing that sucks is the gold isn't vivid enough now some people will say what does that mean and it means this, the silver looks fine but the gold seems like its faint except the part on the face the gold is fine on that part besides that its a awsome watch",78449,4
78450,I wasn't sure at first what size to get so I went a XXXL (normally wear a 16).,78450,4
78450,The fit is okay and has that nice stretchy material.,78450,4
78450,I am 5'5 and the dress falls little above the knee so be careful when ordering if you are tall.,78450,4
78450,With the right body shaper this dress will be great for work and any event.,78450,4
78450,*** I wasn't not paid to leave this comment,78450,4
78451,"A little smaller than I thought it would be but made a
nice birthday present for my husband.",78451,4
78452,This swimsuit is amazing!,78452,4
78452,The material is the right thickness for swimwear.,78452,4
78452,Not too thin or thick.,78452,4
78452,Lacing is secure and looks to be sturdy.,78452,4
78452,"The only reason I did 4 stars is the print is not as vibrant as I expected, however wasn't a big deal.",78452,4
78454,Looks and feel thin but its not,78454,4
78455,I've ordered these socks once before and actually ordered them again by accident.,78455,4
78455,I thought the original ones I had ordered were too thick.,78455,4
78455,"This pair happened to be a bit thinner than the last pair
I ordered (the exact same listing) which I prefer.",78455,4
78455,So I guess this product is a bit inconsistent but in my case it worked out in my favor.,78455,4
78455,They're cute and comfy but the only issue I have is that they tend to keep slipping down.,78455,4
78455,It gets annoying when I'm standing at work for hours and can't keep going to the bathroom to fix them.,78455,4
78456,Remember all Asian sizing runs really small!,78456,4
78456,Make bigger sizes PLEASE,78456,4
78457,"I love the top but it to big ,I need a large size.",78457,4
78457,I need to return it .,78457,4

78462,has inside bikini bottom.,78462,4
78462,"I am a 27"" waist.",78462,4
78462,"I ordered the small which is up t0 29.1""  still too small.",78462,4
78462,I reordered in the next size up.,78462,4
78462,I would say it runs about a size small.,78462,4
78462,"The small fit like a 25""",78462,4
78463,Glad to find this type of pajama in the size ordered.,78463,4
78464,"I'm usually not a slave to name brands or designers but this line is,consistently classic.",78464,4
78465,Not exactly as pictured but definitely a good buy.,78465,4
78465,"Comfortable dress, sleeves are a bit snug but it wouldn't prevent me from returning it.",78465,4
78465,I'm going to wear it to my son's 1st Birthday Party.,78465,4
78465,"It's an airy, comfortable dress.",78465,4
78465,"I'm 5'11 and ordered a large , fits great.",78465,4
78465,"Perfect casual summer dress, price is unbeatable for the quality of the dress.",78465,4
78466,This dress is adorable BUT - the one thing that I could not tell from the photos is that part of the front -- the sections outlining the bust area -- are actually see through mesh.,78466,4
78466,I took it in to a tailor to put fabric behind it (personal preference).,78466,4
78466,"Otherwise, it is a great dress!",78466,4
78467,I love it too!,78467,4
78468,I still would've bought these I just would gave went up a size.,78468,4
78469,These are extremely comfortable.,78469,4
78469,"Out of all of the jeggings I've owned, these fit the best, there's extra room, it passes the sit and squat test.",78469,4
78469,They're extremely soft and there is some extra material at the bottom but a simple pull upward fixes that.,78469,4
78469,I got a size L/XL.,78469,4
78469,"I'm giving four stars because very little lining came undone, but the jeggings haven't fallen apart, and I doubt they will.",78469,4
78469,"I'm currently on a weight loss journey, and no matter how much weight I'll lose or gain, I think I'll always go to these jeggings.",78469,4
78470,"Kind of itchy, but vey soft.",78470,4
78471,"The compartments are great, the color is more reddish-orange than a burgundy that's is posted.",78471,4
78471,"The stitching is not has tight as other purses but for the price pay, I am just hoping it stays together for the duration of my trip.",78471,4
78472,It was a gift.,78472,4
78472,I would like one for myself.,78472,4
78473,I love this top just wasn't aware it was a crop top so unable to wear to my office.,78473,4
78474,Very pretty however it doesnt look exactly as pictured.,78474,4
78474,Still very happy with this.,78474,4
78475,Nice lightweight hoodie that my grandson enjoys.,78475,4
78476,Got size large and fits good.,78476,4
78476,"Thinner material than I thought, but works good since I wear layers.",78476,4
78477,I'm a somewhat smaller girl and the bottoms are just a tad too big but it's barely noticeable.,78477,4
78477,If you're tiny and want a bathing suit that will fit super well this probably isn't for you.,78477,4
78477,I personally love it though.,78477,4
78477,Looks great and feels great!,78477,4
78478,"My only complaint is that they jut out in front of the nipple a bit more than I'd like, but I'm very glad they aren't so tight that they cut off the circulation.",78478,4
78480,Fits a little snug but not that bad.,78480,4
78480,I ordered 2XL and I'm about 240lbs and 6' tall.,78480,4
78481,Have gotten many compliments.,78481,4
78481,Wish it was a bit softer.,78481,4
78482,Nice looking but too small.,78482,4
78483,"Nice, light, airy, sexy brief.",78483,4
78483,Might even try them swimming.,78483,4
78484,Kinda small/short but you can't see how long it is with a suit jacket or vest on.,78484,4
78484,Matched my wedding colors perfectly & my 1.5 year old son looked so handsome in it.,78484,4
78485,looks good and the boy who will wear it is thrilled.,78485,4
78486,Love the color and the location of the straps,78486,4
78487,"I love these pants but being a shorter person with bigger hips (5'1'', 37'') I got a small and the leggings come down to just above my ankles.",78487,4
78487,"The length issue is something I have with almost all 'capri' length leggings so it's not just this brand, but this cut is wider at the bottom so they kind of float an inch or so off of my ankle at it looks a little odd.",78487,4
78487,So I just fold it up to just under the knee and it's fine.,78487,4
78487,The fabric quality is thick and never see through and it's high on the waist which I like.,78487,4
78487,As pictured the waist really does come up to your belly button.,78487,4
78489,"Very cool shorts, but I received them with a malfunctioned zipper.",78489,4
78489,"I tried to get the zipper back on track, but failed.",78489,4
78489,"I returned the shorts and got a different brand, but these are really comfortable shorts and fit amazingly.",78489,4
78489,I will continue to purchase clothing that RVCA makes; it's always great quality.,78489,4
78490,"The color on the inside is a dark brown instead of the nice olive color presented in the pictures, but it's still of amazing quality.",78490,4
78492,"Finishing is a little rough, but seems sturdy enough.",78492,4
78492,"I lose two or three of these hats every winter, so the price is right for me.",78492,4
78492,A decent value for money.,78492,4
78493,"This is not a ""sweatshirt"", but rather more like a jersey shirt.",78493,4
78493,It does not have any fleece inside.,78493,4
78494,I like these bands.,78494,4
78494,I have a wider one that left a tail with three holes remaining.,78494,4
78494,"This one left a tail with one hole remaining, but looks and fits good, so long as you won't wear it over a wetsuit..",78494,4
78494,The webbing is just the right thickness and varies between the 18mm (slightly thinner) and the 22mm slightly thicker.,78494,4
78494,Others I have purchased from other sources had thinner webbing.,78494,4
78494,The hardware is quality.,78494,4
78494,Good looking and practical.,78494,4
78495,Nice quality and fit as expected.,78495,4
78495,Really worked well for our skit.,78495,4
78495,Quality isn't the greatest but you aren't going to wear it every day.....at least you shouldn't.... so it will last for what you need it for.,78495,4
78496,Came earlier than expected.,78496,4
78496,Its waay to big for my face but i think i can make it work.,78496,4
78497,"Very nice, it's hard to tell black or dark navy colors a part.",78497,4
78498,Its a nice dress and good quality but it runs small.. Order a size bigger.,78498,4
78499,"Nice quality, slightly shorter than I thought.",78499,4
78500,"the dress was beautiful, but it was just very unbecoming on me....",78500,4
78501,"Cute top, nice material.",78501,4
78501,I bought it in the 1X size since people said it ran small - I am a 36DD on top.,78501,4
78501,I think an XL would have been pretty small.,78501,4
78501,The colors are true to the picture.,78501,4
78501,Just be sure to size up a couple of sizes.,78501,4
78502,It looks very pretty!,78502,4
78502,"However, it does not have a side pouch to hold a water bottle.",78502,4
78502,This is why a 4-star.,78502,4
78503,Super comfortable and adorable.,78503,4
78503,I've bought several products and have always ordered my actual size and have had no problems,78503,4
78504,Fun for our grandson.,78504,4
78505,it is light fabric but for the money it worth.,78505,4
78506,Love the color and fits as expected.,78506,4
78507,"Qualities was great, just a bit small in the bust.",78507,4
78508,I like the wristlet and will be using it all the time!,78508,4
78509,It fits amazing and it came really fast!,78509,4
78509,"When you walk around in it, it kinda bunches up on the sides but other than that it was a great buy!",78509,4
78509,I recommend this waist trainer to anyone wanting a slimmer look,78509,4
78510,Good buy for the money.,78510,4
78511,I had a hard time finding shorts that I liked.,78511,4
78511,"I feel like I am getting a bit old for the short shorts that teenagers wear, but I am not ready to wear mid thigh shorts like my mother.",78511,4
78511,These were a good mix.,78511,4
78511,I would say they are slightly longer than I wanted but I cuffed them at the seam once and that made them perfect.,78511,4
78511,I plan on buying another pair.,78511,4
78512,Always order at least 2 sizes larger.,78512,4
78513,"These were cute, but fabric did not stretch as expected and they were almost awkwardly short.",78513,4
78513,"I ordered a small and I am 5'3, 100lbs and they were too small.",78513,4
78514,"I give them 4 stars even though I ordered a large and it it's too small for my foot (size 10 men's) because the quality and overall appearance is good, I will give them to my wife and order another pair for myself.",78514,4
78516,my daughter LOVES them!,78516,4
78517,It is good but the belt is missing.,78517,4
78518,Great fit and can be grow into for a few months...,78518,4
78519,I get tons of compliments!,78519,4
78519,They're a bit bigger than I wished!,78519,4
78520,Likes Thest Pants very much..,78520,4
78521,"Perfect tie, very modern and stylish, perfect for young men.",78521,4
78522,"This pencil skirt fits nicely, has soft material and is a vibrant color.",78522,4
78522,I ordered a large as I always go up a size from my US size.,78522,4
78522,I could stand just a tad more length because of my height but other than that its a keeper.,78522,4
78524,After reading reviews from others I decided to go a size up.,78524,4
78524,The only problem I have is that it's a bit snug around the neck.,78524,4
78524,Otherwise a great buy.,78524,4
78525,Cool shirt but it will not fit you unless you're US X small or small.,78525,4
78525,I'm slim and wear US medium but the XL was skin tight and the buttons were about to burst open.,78525,4
78526,Works perfect under a cami.,78526,4
78526,"No support, no lining.",78526,4
78530,They are SUPER comfy.,78530,4
78530,The legs are snug but the waist is pretty loose.,78530,4
78530,I would have thought it would fit a little more snug so they did not slide down so easy but they are still comfy enough that I will wear them anyway.,78530,4
78534,"Real nice on blocking out sun ,little heavy, love the polarized lens",78534,4
78535,"Great Bathingsuit, however the bust fit very well and around the bottom was way too big.",78535,4
78535,"I was sad, because I loved the way it looked, but I had to return it.",78535,4
78537,Runs small according to size chart.,78537,4
78538,Nice gift for special someone they loved it,78538,4
78539,I really like these but are a little small.,78539,4
78539,Will buy in the next size up when it's time,78539,4
78540,I am petite so I ordered small.,78540,4
78540,I didn't think it would fit perfectly as I usually wear extra small.,78540,4
78540,The only problem I have is the top because it's a little loose.,78540,4
78540,"Other than that, everything is good and I'm happy and satisfied with this item",78540,4
78541,A nice gift for my daughter.,78541,4
78542,Nice material good quality.,78542,4
78543,I'm usually a meduim but I ordered a large.,78543,4
78543,"Fits great, but material is thin and kinda see-through.",78543,4
78543,Still wearing it though :),78543,4
78547,Shrink at least a full size and the pant legs end up really short.,78547,4
78547,"I'm only 5'2"" and the pant legs are short for me!",78547,4
78548,I love this print.,78548,4
78548,I have been looking for it for some time.,78548,4
78548,I wore it to a convention and multiple people asked where I got it.,78548,4
78548,The only downside is the letters look and feel cheap.,78548,4
78548,I would not be surprised if in a few washed the lettering starts to come off.,78548,4
78548,There are a few cracks starting already.,78548,4
78548,But for a fun occasional fan shirt it's pretty great.,78548,4
78550,NICE BRA FOR DAUGHTER BUT RUN A LITTLE SMALL.,78550,4
78551,This shirt fit me decently but it is definitely more of women's sizing than mens.,78551,4
78551,The arm cutouts go pretty low as well.,78551,4
78551,"However, the material is good and the design on the shirt itself is awesome looking, does not look like it will crack in the dryer!",78551,4
78552,I love this blouse and chose it because my husband loves me wearing pink.,78552,4
78552,"This is a lovely, feminine top.",78552,4
78552,"The only downsides to it are that the uppermost part of the sleeves are somewhat tight, and the crochet stitching is somewhat easily unraveled.",78552,4
78552,This blouse must be handled with care.,78552,4
78552,It is very pretty though.,78552,4
78554,Bought it for the grandson.,78554,4
78555,Very cute & great quality but runs small.,78555,4
78556,"Nice top, fit as expected.",78556,4
78556,"I'm 5'7"" and 125 lbs and I ordered a Medium.",78556,4
78557,Wreath is a bit flexible,78557,4
78558,Cute dress but the lining isn't long enough for the dress.,78558,4
78558,You can see through the material from about the hips down.,78558,4
78559,everything is perfect other than the fact that these are screwed on so tight that i still haven't unscrewed the ball on the second piercing (been trying for about an hour and a half now),78559,4
78560,A little long for someone only 5'2 even when small.,78560,4
78560,But waist is perfect.,78560,4
78561,"Great design, arrived within 2 weeks of ordering.",78561,4
78561,I'm 5 ft 7 180 lbs got a large it fits great with some room for when I add some more mass.,78561,4
78562,"I thought it would be a little longer, but I like it",78562,4
78563,"I liked the product and it works nice but it doesn't sit as well because of some gaps on the neck, overall I love it!",78563,4
78564,Beautiful but too small.,78564,4
78564,They don't stretch at all,78564,4
78565,Its super cute but im a 34D and i got the M. Its just not flattering in the boob section.,78565,4
78565,I have more boob coming out of the side then the front,78565,4
78566,Love the shirt and the awareness it helps to bring to childhood cancer,78566,4
78567,"Love this company,love this shirt.",78567,4
78567,I've run into a problem recently where these two-blend types of shirts seem to run just a tab snug so if you're the type of person who like a looser for might need to go up a size.,78567,4
78568,They were OK a little to big but I like the design there cool.,78568,4
78569,Don't expect it to hold your boobs up.,78569,4
78569,Color is as shown.,78569,4
78569,Fringes float all over the place when trying to swim.,78569,4
78569,I felt like I wanted to braid them because they were so annoying.,78569,4
78569,Great coverage though hence the five stars and the fit is a little big.,78569,4
78569,Haven't felt this confident in a swimsuit in quite a while.,78569,4
78570,This mask is so beautiful!,78570,4
78570,I purchased it for a New Year's masquerade party and was very pleased with the product.,78570,4
78570,The only issue I had was that it is a tie back mask so I had to keep redoing the tie.,78570,4
78571,Loop is a little big but good overall :),78571,4
78572,"Unique, nice design character.",78572,4
78573,The fabric is so soft and comfortable.,78573,4
78573,Stretch is good and length on my petite frame is good too.,78573,4
78573,I could use an extra few inches in the back as the waist sits low in the back and high in the front.,78573,4
78573,It will depend on your shape.,78573,4
78573,"Some leggings are too long and bunch up in a pile at my ankles, these I could move the fabric up my legs and length is really nice.",78573,4
78574,This is a really cute dress !,78574,4
78574,It is not itchy an looks great .,78574,4
78574,Only problem I had was it is a little large on me  I wear a size small an ordered a  medium  Because of reviews it fits great around my waste but is big in the Brest an slides down on my bra .,78574,4
78574,I would order true to size !,78574,4
78575,I think this top is super cute!,78575,4
78575,"The fabric is very thin, so be aware that any bra you wear under it, or even pants will causes creases in it!",78575,4
78576,"Fits a little big in the seat, but not bad.",78576,4
78577,Cute but slightly small.,78577,4
78578,People have admired the design and the colors even is too large.,78578,4
78580,"Looks beautiful, I got it to match my earrings .",78580,4
78581,"I think it was a bit too pricey for the product but, It was cute and I didn't want to make it so this definitely saved me time and its pretty!",78581,4
78582,Good fit but extra string that I had no idea how to remove since there were no open ends,78582,4
78583,I love the 90 Degree reflex yoga capris...I wear them every day.,78583,4
78583,"They are not see-through like several other brands, stretch well while maintaining shape.",78583,4
78583,"And very comfortable...they don't cut into your waist, even when sitting.",78583,4
78583,"I am 5'3"", 160 pounds and purchased the Medium.",78583,4
78583,"The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the 22"" are longer than I like--I haven't been able to find 17"" in this brand, and the other brands I tried are either too thin or not well made like the 90 degrees.",78583,4
78583,I end up rolling the hem up to the length I like.,78583,4
78583,But you cannot go wrong with this brand.,78583,4
78584,"I love, love, love this belt, but the sizing is tricky.",78584,4
78584,"Having to choose between S/M or M/L is very difficult when you're an M.  I ordered the M/L, but it is too large, and I'm guessing the S/M would have been too small.",78584,4
78584,"It's a beautiful belt, though, and very flattering.",78584,4
78584,I'll be taking it to the cobbler to see if he can make it smaller.,78584,4
78585,Fits good for my sis and good quality,78585,4
78587,It's that cheap material but still really cute,78587,4
78588,This dress is very pretty and it fit great except I have big boobs and it wouldn't fit over my boobs so I had to return it,78588,4
78589,"Definitely helps smooth things out, but it very thin.",78589,4
78589,"Luckily I only needed it for one occasion, not sure how long it would last if you wanted to wear it regularly.",78589,4
78591,"I'm a M/L and I ordered Medium (I'm 5'6"", 145lbs, 29"" waist, 37"" hips, 36C).",78591,4
78591,The top fit great!,78591,4
78591,I couldn't be happier.,78591,4
78591,The bottoms were... a little snug for my taste.,78591,4
78591,I can get away with wearing them - but I feel like the bottoms create a slight muffin top effect.,78591,4
78591,"If I could do it over, I'd probably order the large.",78591,4
78591,"OR you could easily pair what fits you with any other black top of bottom, so it's still a great buy.",78591,4
78592,"Looks cute,and is functional.",78592,4
78592,"This was a gift,and the recipient is pleased with it.",78592,4
78593,"The necklace is quite pretty, and seems well made.",78593,4
78593,"HOWEVER, it is about 58"" long and there is no catch, so it's impossible to wear it as triple strand, unless you have an abnormally tiny head!",78593,4
78593,"It's a long single or a double, not a triple.",78593,4
78596,Loved it and it fit great perfect shirt for my friends sons first birthday.,78596,4
78597,It is what you see.,78597,4
78597,Nice for a few uses but not made for long term wear.,78597,4
78598,Just a bit too large.,78598,4
78598,I wish it was adjustable.,78598,4
78599,This is a really cute necklace!,78599,4
78599,It's about the size of a quarter and clear.,78599,4
78599,The metal piece attached to the charm is marked 925 (silver) but the chain is not and looks fairly cheap for the price- in my opinion.,78599,4
78599,I just used another silver chain I had so no big deal.,78599,4
78599,That is the only reason i deducted a star.,78599,4
78599,This would make a great gift!,78599,4
78599,"Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.",78599,4
78600,"Cute top, but size up",78600,4
78601,"It actually stays on my toddler, and completely blocks the sun from all angles.",78601,4
78601,"It does get a little toasty under the hat which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but really you want it for sun protection so it's still great.",78601,4
78602,I like this top its very cute.,78602,4
78602,"I'm about a 36C, and it is not really supportive, but it is still comfortable and cute.",78602,4
78603,It's a cute scarf and is very soft.,78603,4
78603,The only thing I don't love is it is not very long.,78603,4
78604,Truly lovely lace shirt with an integral shell lining starting just above the top of the breast down to the waist.,78604,4
78604,"Bought for slender 5'3"" tween for dance recital.",78604,4
78604,Ordered size 10 in accordance with product size chart measurements and fits as advertised.,78604,4
78604,"Sizes seem geared to youth or slender, model-figured adult; definitely not full-figured women.",78604,4
78604,Only product concern is that the lace around the top of the neckline and at the end of the sleeves is not stitched nor is there any fusible taping used to prevent fraying.,78604,4
78604,"The lace itself in these areas is just cut with loose thread ends sticking up, definitely not finished as shown in the fourth product photo for the yellow shirt.",78604,4
78604,Concerned that long-term wear and laundering may lead to shredding / fraying of the lace in these areas.,78604,4
78605,"These are great looking gloves, used them for driving.",78605,4
78605,"The touch screen did work initially, but couldn't text with them effectively.",78605,4
78605,If anything I could answer calls with my phone.,78605,4
78605,"After a few months of use in the Michigan winter, the touch screen does not work at all.",78605,4
78605,"I first went with the medium, and they were too big,  the small are nice and snug, but a little short as they don't cover my wrists all the way.",78605,4
78605,I wore them this past nov-december in Chicago.,78605,4
78605,If I kept my hands in my pocket they would stay warm.,78605,4
78605,If out in 0-15 degree weather my hands would get cold with these.,78605,4
78606,Gave this as a gift.,78606,4
78606,Just a big larger than expected.,78606,4
78606,But my GF says it doesn't smash her hair down so I guess that is a good thing.,78606,4
78606,She likes the dark cloth that is under the brim.,78606,4
78606,The large brim can very easily catch the wind.,78606,4
78606,You need to almost always use the chin strap so you don't have to run after it.,78606,4
78607,"I ordered a medium, the bottom and top fit good but the top cud fit up to a C or D cup while im a B but overall a good fit... oh the colour does look a bit mre blue but its ok and the style and material is comfy 2.",78607,4
78607,Nice product :)  ...buttt..,78607,4
78607,ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WEAR TO THE BEACH THE INNER MATERIAL HAS NO SPACE FOR THE SAND TO EXIT BUT IT SURE GOES IN...,78607,4
78607,I HAD TO CUT SLITS ON BOTH SIDES FOR THE SAND TO COME OUT!!!!!,78607,4
78607,Even so i had a lot of fun with it :),78607,4
78609,"These are great booties, everyone that sees them wants a pair!",78609,4
78610,Where have these been all my life?,78610,4
78612,"Feathers broke off pretty quickly, so it may be better for an older girl, or baby/toddler that doesn't yank it off.",78612,4
78613,The color was on point and the size was too!,78613,4
78613,But I do need alterations only to fit the length of the skirt...,78613,4
78613,Other than that it's great,78613,4
78614,"I have a big head, like sometimes small objects get caught up in its orbit big.",78614,4
78614,This thing I can make fit fairly comfortably.,78614,4
78614,I'm guessing it would be perfect for people with normal noggins.,78614,4
78616,I would have given it 5 stars but I'm not sure if I like the way it fits my bottom area.,78616,4
78616,This is a great lifter for someone who has a smaller bottom.,78616,4
78617,"Dress is beautiful, too small.",78617,4
78617,Will be ordering bigger size,78617,4
78619,I would have given it 5 stars but for a 24 month size it is a bit snug.,78619,4
78619,"Still wearable and doable for what I need it for, but I would size up if you can (didn't go above 24 month or I might have)",78619,4
78620,Great deal... Great for the cost,78620,4
78621,Skirt will not fit a medI'm as described in the details.,78621,4
78621,I'm a size 2 or 4 and the skirt seemed to fit almost perfect.,78621,4
78621,There is about a 5 inch zipper that seems a little cheap and hinders anyone not small enough from being able to sport the skirt.,78621,4
78621,The matrial isn't as cheap as some other reviews made it seem.,78621,4
78621,Thigh highs are more like knee highs.,78621,4
78621,"I'm 5'6"" maybe that's why??",78621,4
78621,Top was very blah looking but does the job.,78621,4
78621,The material is a weird stretchy material that will allow for bigger boobs *I did not need that stretch and the top manage's to look ** okay ** on my 32B.,78621,4
78621,"The white collar and tie come in 2 pieces that are HARD to figure out, at best.",78621,4
78621,They both are one long piece of fabric.,78621,4
78621,The white collar had a safety pin on one end.,78621,4
78621,So I am assuming you have to safety pin the tie to the collar after putting it on ...,78621,4
78621,"I am going to sew velcro on for my use bc how fun is doing a 2"" safety pin when you are playing lol.",78621,4
78621,The tie had a applique that was random lol.,78621,4
78621,"It said ""police"" haha ... maybe they mixed it up
.. maybe they figured no one would notice...

Bottom Line: if you are a size 0-4 this is perfect for the price.",78621,4
78621,I would totally buy it again or recommend.,78621,4
78622,Super short but very cute when paired with leggings/tights.,78622,4
78623,I wear these fangs every Halloween and they are definitely worth their price.,78623,4
78623,"However, I needed to remold mine so purchased this kit.",78623,4
78623,"It does not come with a mixing container or stick, which It needs to for the price.",78623,4
78624,"got this for a friend's toddler who when promoted said he wanted a ""dinosaur or snake shirt"" for his birthday ... this apparently fit the bill.",78624,4
78625,We bought some for our daughter two months ago.,78625,4
78626,Not really a sweater-- more like a stretchy Lycra top.,78626,4
78626,It also is a tad bit small fitting even tho I normally wear a medium and ordered a large.,78626,4
78626,"It is a nice top, however, casual.",78626,4
78628,"Very soft material ,I love it",78628,4
78629,These are nice ties for the price.,78629,4
78629,I usually pay $50 to $90 for a tie.,78629,4
78630,Nicely made and good quality.,78630,4
78631,"It's nice and comfy, though it would be nice if the sole was a little thick though.",78631,4
78632,"I read the reviews and they where saying that the dress runs big so buy a smaller size, not true buy a bigger size so that it will hang right.",78632,4
78632,I purchase a large and should have purchase a extra large.,78632,4
78634,Fits well and surprising good for the price that you pay,78634,4
78635,Got size 4 for my son.,78635,4
78635,He wears a US 3.5 boys.,78635,4
78635,The 4 barely fit.,78635,4
78635,Returned and got the 5.,78635,4
78635,He loves them and says they are super comfortable.,78635,4
78635,Took away a star only for bad sizing,78635,4
78636,Bought for my daughter and they were perfect.,78636,4
78637,"This is my first time trying toe socks/yoga socks, and I love them.",78637,4
78637,They're surprisingly comfortable and great for the Eczema on my feet.,78637,4
78637,They help keep the moisture away from in between the toes.,78637,4
78637,I do wish that the ankle portion fit better.,78637,4
78637,It's tight on the front of my ankles.,78637,4
78638,The top part is not stretchable but the good thing the material is good,78638,4
78639,Very happy with the product .,78639,4
78639,More than I had hoped for.,78639,4
78640,Exactly as the pictures show ... Love the material and fit ...,78640,4
78640,I ordered a size up and it fit great ... Usually wear a medium and I ordered a large and was very happy with my decision,78640,4
78641,Cute and fits true to size!,78641,4
78642,The skirt fit perfect!,78642,4
78642,The only thing was that the skirt had a few wrinkles when it arrived in the package.,78642,4
78643,We lived this - one for husband - 1 for me.,78643,4
78643,Downside - shrinks a lot and is the top is already sized a little small,78643,4
78644,"Good size, nice Ravenclaw emblem that isn't scratchy on the inside of the pant leg.",78644,4
78644,The fabric isn't as thick as I was hoping but they still look and feel pretty good.,78644,4
78645,The watch itself is very handsome and has performed as an automatic movement should lost no time over the first 48 hours.,78645,4
78645,"I deduct one start as the band, although stamped genuine leather is very pedestrian.",78645,4
78646,The size was smaller than expected but the quality is good.,78646,4
78647,They are cute and fit my daughter well.,78647,4
78648,"I am unhappy that because I had to return it and get a smaller size, it cost $11.00 for shipping.",78648,4
78648,Would be nice if I got reinbursed for that amount but doubtful.,78648,4
78648,Would have given it  5 stars but this top is going to cost me big bucks!,78648,4
78649,"Got these for my guy, who usually ops for basketball shorts in the water- but with a trip to the beach I'd wanted him to have something more suitable.",78649,4
78649,Great length (we were concerned as he is 6'3...) but they were a perfect fit.,78649,4
78649,"We ordered a size larger, just in case they ran small& that was a mistake, the sizing was exactly as you'd expect, so we had to take his in a little bit.",78649,4
78649,But outside of our own blunder the shorts were great!,78649,4
78650,it has dark some black stains on the inside but it looks good,78650,4
78654,"The stand was shorter than I expected, but not enough to return it.",78654,4
78654,The base looks much better than expected and the plush inside it should protect my glasses well.,78654,4
78654,The main reason for purchasing it was to be able to FIND my glasses!,78654,4
78657,This purse is great.,78657,4
78657,I get many compliments and it is well made.,78657,4
78657,The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the photos make the concealed pocket appear to be more rigid like a holster.,78657,4
78657,It is a pocket only.,78657,4
78658,"Wanted petite, but will have it shortened.",78658,4
78659,The jewelry is very well made!,78659,4
78659,And I get a lot of compliments on it.,78659,4
78659,"But, the back of the clip broke the first day I got it.",78659,4
78659,So I had to replace the chain.,78659,4
78659,"But other than that, I'm happy about the product!",78659,4
78660,This dress worked really well for my friends wedding.,78660,4
78660,It looked good on me.,78660,4
78660,It came on time and the fit is accurate.,78660,4
78660,"The flowers are kind of poorly sewed on, but that would be my only criticism.",78660,4
78661,My mother loves it.,78661,4
78662,The dress is flowy and comfortable.,78662,4
78662,"However, a tank or cami needs to be worn as areas with lace are see through.",78662,4
78663,I'm a medium build guy usually I fit a large 190 lb.s 6' but for these an extra larg would have been better.,78663,4
78664,"Really nice, but not executed fully--returned it; would require a seamstress to make it smaller.",78664,4
78664,I ordered a small and it was still big.,78664,4
78665,The knee-socks was kinda tight when it came to my knees and Im 5'4 and weigh 124 but overall its cute.,78665,4
78666,the string for the back piece was a tad too short.,78666,4
78667,"nice, would have liked xl  , but large was the only size.",78667,4
78667,great design like it,78667,4
78668,I bought this as a gift for my friend.,78668,4
78668,"Instead of as a night time wear, I am presenting it as a decorative shirt to wear over a simpler, long sleeve shirt.",78668,4
78668,She loves to layer.,78668,4
78668,The color is accurate and the fit is flattering.,78668,4
78668,"If worn as just a night gown type thing, it is a bit revealing, and to me personally, its too see through to be of any real comfort but I know other people may like that.",78668,4
78669,I actually really like this bra.,78669,4
78669,It is these second one I ordered.,78669,4
78669,"However, I tried it on and found that the cup size was a tad too big.",78669,4
78669,I think this is due to the fact that I lost a few pounds.,78669,4
78669,"Otherwise, it is a great bra, looks good under a T-Shirt and the straps stay up.",78669,4
78669,I personally wash them by hand and hang to dry so my bras usually last a pretty long time.,78669,4
78671,I'm 5'8 174lbs I ordered a large but they sent me a small the top fit perfectly but I had to cut the elastic out of the waist to fit.,78671,4
78671,Other than that it's a pretty good buy for the little money,78671,4
78672,It was a hit.,78672,4
78672,The smell was over welming.,78672,4
78672,Made my whole room smell like felmeldhide to strong everyone liked them fit well .,78672,4
78672,Why was the smell so strong?,78672,4
78673,"Really love these, definitely shows dirt caused of the lighter color, but we knew that would happen.",78673,4
78674,"I really do love this shirt, but it is a little too short for my taste.",78674,4
78674,"Were it three inches longer, it would be five stars!",78674,4
78675,outside fit and look was great however  the jacket interior lining is little out of fashion,78675,4
78676,I love it because you get every one and color and one except buying individual ones .,78676,4
78677,"Nice, but a bit delicate-wrinkles and runs / knaps a little too easily",78677,4
78678,"A little to big for me ,but I just pull the string tighter.",78678,4
78679,"I like these little art wallets, but Im finding that they hold very few cards.",78679,4
78679,"If you put more than just a few in them, they pop open and won't  close.",78679,4
78679,"I wanted to put my credit cards, drivers license, insurance cards and a little cash, but they won't  hold that much.",78679,4
78679,"I've  had to pare down the contents so I can just take this little wallet instead of my purse to the rec center, etc.",78679,4
78679,where having a purse isn't  convenient.,78679,4
78679,Cute but not as helpful as I'd  hoped.,78679,4
78680,"An okay belt, as straightforward as cheap belts go.",78680,4
78680,The color is more reddish in person and I would like for it to have come with more holes (I had to poke two extra holes in in since I bought it as my stomach shrank a bit).,78680,4
78681,"I sized up, bc of the reviews from shirts from this company, and its too big.",78681,4
78681,Buy your regular size.,78681,4
78682,It was kind of small on me but it still was cute!,78682,4
78682,I wore it as a bathing suit to the beach and just as a one piece top!,78682,4
78683,"Nice buy, little tight on the chest, but will fit my needs.",78683,4
78684,"i've bought many pairs of pants from Amazon, but this one stands out for great fabric - soft but not wrinkly.",78684,4
78684,"The shape
and fine stitching are tops.",78684,4
78684,"Not a five start because I'm old
and hippy and the waist won't foldover well.",78684,4
78685,"The top does run a little big, but I was prepared for this based on previous reviews.",78685,4
78685,The bottom provides great coverage and an amazing fit!,78685,4
78686,"Lot's of room, not a heavy bag.",78686,4
78686,It did have a very strong chemical smell.,78686,4
78688,"I liked it just too small for me, i would order a size up.",78688,4
78691,"It's a good sturdy case however, most of the cards don't really fit completely like the ikea card or grocery store cards.",78691,4
78691,"Also , the cards that.",78691,4
78691,Don't fit keep sliding out of the pocket.,78691,4
78691,"If you are looking for something that just keeps all your cards visible and organized at one place, go for it.",78691,4
78691,We use it for the same purpose for the cards that we don't always use and business cards.,78691,4
78691,Overall a good product for not so frequent use.,78691,4
78692,"a fine watch, very accurate, looks great, easy to set and synchronize (commando-style)  with other watches, chrono function is accessible and works well....would be five stars if not for the water vulnerability.",78692,4
78692,"after a shower, there was visible moisture between the layers of the crystal; no moisture inside the works, just a fog on the crystal, which took several days to dissipate.",78692,4
78692,"all indicators can be adjusted, dial luminescence is rather low after ambient light...

this is now my everyday watch, but I won't get it wet beyond handwashing....",78692,4
78693,"Still fits well, looks great!",78693,4
78693,If these were a little cheaper I'd get some more.,78693,4
78695,"i am 5'2"" and 128/130 lbs and 34 C and got a medium.",78695,4
78695,"the top fit fine, wasn't super flattering on the boobs but fine.",78695,4
78695,But the bottoms i definiteyl could have gone up to a large.,78695,4
78695,"actually maybe a large for both, but im not willing to buy another and find out.",78695,4
78695,also pattern on the bottoms look worse as the stretch out.,78695,4
78696,Worked really well in the Chicago snow!,78696,4
78697,So cute- Had one like it years ago.,78697,4
78698,Fits a little bit big but quality is very good.,78698,4
78698,Quite happy with the hat.,78698,4
78699,"This gown is beautiful, and I love it.",78699,4
78699,The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it shrinks tremendously.,78699,4
78699,"Before washing, it was ankle-legnth; after washing, it was just barely  below my knees.",78699,4
78699,"Most of the shrinkage was in the length, not the width, so the gown still fit.",78699,4
78699,It was just much shorter after washing.,78699,4
78699,"I am 5'1"" and normally wear a size medium.",78699,4
78699,This is the 2nd gown I bought like this.,78699,4
78699,"Because it shrinks so much, I bought the 2nd gown in XL.",78699,4
78699,"After washing, the XL gown fit well, only very slightly large through the shoulders but the original ankle-length became mid-calf-length.",78699,4
78700,Be sure to order one size up.,78700,4
78700,Very cute the pants are a little different but not by much.,78700,4
78701,"the fit was perfect, except i ordered burgundy and received RED.",78701,4
78701,i'm still gonna rock it tho,78701,4
78702,Very cute baby swim shorts.,78702,4
78702,They are quite long in the legs.,78702,4
78702,"The waist does seem small, and I did order up a size as suggested in other reviews.",78702,4
78702,"However, it is a swim nappy, so has to have a snug fit to be effective.",78702,4
78704,Longer than expected but it fits nice,78704,4
78705,Shirt fits great but the shorts are quite a bit smaller then expected,78705,4
78706,Received the coat in 2 days.,78706,4
78706,"Unfortunately, the coat received appeared to be used and it had defective stitching.",78706,4
78706,The coat did not come with new product tags.,78706,4
78706,The draw strings were adjusted (knotted) to accommodate the previous owner's preferred fit.,78706,4
78706,"Also, the fabric had a slightly broken-in feel to it as compared to the new replacement coat I eventually received.",78706,4
78706,The stitching defect was located at the corner of the front upper left pocket.,78706,4
78706,The defect caused the corner of the pocket not to lay flat.,78706,4
78706,It's disappointing that there was an apparent breakdown in quality control with this product.,78706,4
78706,"On the positive side, I was immediately sent a replacement coat that was new (tags and spare button attached) and free of defects.",78706,4
78706,"In fact, the coat is well-made with quality fabric, zipper, stitching, snaps, buttons, etc.",78706,4
78706,The two inside pockets are a nice touch.,78706,4
78706,"One closes with velcro, the other with a zipper.",78706,4
78706,"I'm 6'2"" 190-lbs with average frame and the medium fit good with and without the liner.",78706,4
78706,"The coat comes folded in a plastic bag, so you start out with a wrinkled coat.",78706,4
78706,It will need to be pressed if a cleaner look is desired.,78706,4
78706,The coat is very nice.,78706,4
78706,I'm deducting one star due to their quality control miscue.,78706,4
78707,I have a different pattern of this dress but the top/breast area of this dress is too big as the other one fits perfect.,78707,4
78707,Cute dress for curvy ladies.,78707,4
78708,Little small on boobs but I love it,78708,4
78709,Wasn't too flimsy in quality.,78709,4
78709,Fit rather well for being a bit over weight.,78709,4
78709,"200lbs, 5'10"" but 47"" chest.",78709,4
78709,Without the usual sleeve or shirt running down like a gangster.,78709,4
78710,"It was a little bit smaller than I expected but I love it otherwise, IA IA FTGN",78710,4
78711,My granddaughter love it,78711,4
78712,dress is beautiful but runs a bit large.,78712,4
78713,"Bought this for my friend for Christmas, she really seemed to like it.",78713,4
78713,She's always wearing scarves like year round.,78713,4
78714,I love the littlest bikinis & these thongs are even smaller and sexier !,78714,4
78714,I wish the company made little narrow back bikinis with this great fabric.,78714,4
78714,"Narrower sides would be better in my opinion, as would a small pouch liner to keep your thin ball skin from trying to protrude through the holes.",78714,4
78715,cute - good quality - but too tight as other reviewers have said.,78715,4
78715,"i would say my wrists are average - i've never had trouble with standard store bracelets or bangles, but this doesn't fit me well.",78715,4
78716,It was way bigger than the sizing chart indicated.,78716,4
78716,"When I asked to return it for a smaller size, they wanted me to pay for shipping.",78716,4
78716,I love the color and style so I bought another one and kept the huge one.,78716,4
78716,I will probably give the big one as a gift.,78716,4
78716,Just note that the sizing chart is WAY off.,78716,4
78717,Definitely need to size up.,78717,4
78718,The only issue is the fabric doesnt breathe.,78718,4
78719,Chain broke off on first use.,78719,4
78720,Had to return bc way too small.,78720,4
78720,Im typically a medium and it was sooooooo TIGHT!,78720,4
78721,I really hate to give this hat four stars because I do feel it's a little big but I have a really hard time finding hats is it fit my head the way I like them so I am a little picky.,78721,4
78721,This hat is extremely warm well made and I would recommend to anyone that has trouble finding a hat that's right because this one is almost right,78721,4
78722,"These leggings are pretty great, as I often have a hard time finding leggings that can handle my thigh & butt regions, even in plus size.",78722,4
78722,"These cover them pretty well, plus the fleece is really cozy.",78722,4
78722,"The only problem I have is that, the first time I wore them, I got a hole in the ""lady parts"" area.",78722,4
78722,"It is pretty small, so I'm going to sew it up, but maybe a reinforcement of that area is something the manufacturer may want to look into.",78722,4
78723,"I was expecting these to be longer, but that was probably my own fault.",78723,4
78723,They are sturdy and good quality laces that look great with my converse,78723,4
78724,Would give 5 stars but the cuffs were to small to get my hand through I had to cut a slit in each cuff so they would fit.,78724,4
78724,And I ordered a large.,78724,4
78724,But besides that fit just fine.,78724,4
78725,Comfortable but they kind of look like scrubs :/ They are baggy and really long!!,78725,4
78725,Even for someone with long legs - they drag on the floor.,78725,4
78725,Good for around the house but not to wear out in public unless you have a good tailor and work at a hospital...,78725,4
78726,These are great and exceptional for the cost.,78726,4
78726,"My only gripe is that material wise, they are a bit stiff making them a little uncomfortable for my daughter.",78726,4
78727,These work pretty good.,78727,4
78727,I have not tried these before but they hold the pin if it is not too heavy.,78727,4
78729,"It took till the end of the estimated arrival time so even though I ordered it long before Christmas, it wasn't here anywhere near time.",78729,4
78730,It looks just like shown and the fabric is soft and comfortable.,78730,4
78731,Bought these mittens for our newborn.,78731,4
78731,He has very long fingers and they were cramped in other mittens.,78731,4
78731,These mittens have plenty of space for his fingers to still wiggle around and protect him from scratching his face.,78731,4
78731,"Of course, he can still get them off his hands quite quickly if he wants.",78731,4
78731,The wrist strap only has a small region of velcro so the size of the opening is pretty fixed.,78731,4
78731,"With better tightening options, I would give this mitten 5 stars.",78731,4
78732,A little awkward fitting but not too too bad.,78732,4
78732,Super cute and goes with literally anything.,78732,4
78735,Too tight on the middle lace parts on arm.,78735,4
78736,"The color, length, and shape was perfect, just like the picture, but the material is like spandex, so it's kind of shiny which makes it look slightly cheap.",78736,4
78737,I was shocked this fit me.,78737,4
78737,Lately I've been trying to get some clothing item off amazon.,78737,4
78737,I find the best are the ones with stretchy material.,78737,4
78737,This covers what needs to be covered.,78737,4
78737,"I do suggest no bra, otherwise defeats the halter style purpose.",78737,4
78737,Assembling is a bit frustrating at first.,78737,4
78737,But the is no real wrong way to weave the back straps.,78737,4
78737,"I don't really tie it around my waist after as it runs out of ""rope"".",78737,4
78737,Just tie a bow in the back.,78737,4
78737,If you have an above average size chest try and get bigger size as it may be harder to keep covered.,78737,4
78739,The jeans are baggy in the legs like they should be and fit almost perfectly.,78739,4
78739,The waist and crotch areas are a little tight and these jeans do not stretch but overall I am happy with my purchase.,78739,4
78740,Straps fall on the shoulders which feels awkward.,78740,4
78741,The skirt feels like it is made of a thin swimsuit material.,78741,4
78741,It hangs nicely and I got a lot of compliments on it when I wore it today.,78741,4
78741,It feels like it would be cool on a hot day.,78741,4
78742,"****By somewhat Large I mean that they are too long for me of 5' 4"" and the crotch goes past my belly button and maybe 3"" below my sternum.",78742,4
78742,It does not need to be that long but I guess it's slimming??,78742,4
78742,Other then that they do fit me they are just too long in the ankles (They end at the ball of my feet) and the crotch is too long.,78742,4
78742,Other than that I really like them,78742,4
78743,Just a shell so not to good in cold weather but as a wind breaker will work just fine.,78743,4
78744,cool hat just not as large as it says,78744,4
78745,These were perfect for my 1 year old.,78745,4
78745,She has lost at least 10 pairs of earrings so the endless hoop was perfect for her.,78745,4
78745,They're small enough to not be a bother to her.,78745,4
78745,I don't worry about them catching on things.,78745,4
78745,My 4 year old ask if she could have a pair also!,78745,4
78746,"It's lovely,but sent back for larger size.",78746,4
78746,I'm a 6-8 and ordered a Med.,78746,4
78746,hope an XL will fit!,78746,4
78747,"These are cute, quality is fair.",78747,4
78748,Cute top was a little big but I ordered it one size up because I thought it might run small.,78748,4
78748,I do like I though.,78748,4
78749,"I like the fit of the dress, but I would've like it to bit slightly loosed.",78749,4
78749,Love the quality of the dress.,78749,4
78750,It fit good but was really itchy,78750,4
78751,Was expecting something more form fitting.,78751,4
78751,Instead the lower part is very loose.,78751,4
78751,"A smaller size would've left the sleeves too short, they're already at the limit.",78751,4
78751,"It's also completely white, I was under the impression it had some slightly contrasting bits.",78751,4
78751,Feels warm and soft otherwise.,78751,4
78751,Arrived much faster than estimated.,78751,4
78752,So soft and fits wonderfully!,78752,4
78753,"They are beautiful, a little larger than I expected but very nice quality!",78753,4
78754,"Love the glasses, make night driving less stressful.",78754,4
78754,However lens popped out as soon as I opened the package.,78754,4
78754,I kept putting it back in.,78754,4
78754,"I am returning, which seems to be easy.",78754,4
78754,"I would order another pair, but worry the same thing would happen.",78754,4
78755,"Love it, fits perfect.",78755,4
78756,I look terrible in hats but they are a necessity in the bitter cold weather.,78756,4
78756,I decided to try one with a brim to see if it would look any better and it does.,78756,4
78756,"It fits great, looks good and will be useful  in the winter months.",78756,4
78757,"As with all of Patty Boutik clothes, it is very well made, soft and comfortable to wear.",78757,4
78757,But I had to return it because the small was too big on me (I'm 5'2).,78757,4
78757,Other Patty's clothes have fit me well so I say this one runs somewhat large.,78757,4
78758,Since the color is off I can't use it with my purple strapless dress.,78758,4
78758,I'm a size M/L.,78758,4
78759,"Absolutely beautiful , Can't wait to wear it this weekend !",78759,4
78761,These are true to size nice and snug not too baggy and the print doesn't fade with washing my.son got these for Christmas and loved them,78761,4
78762,Runs a little small but better quality than I thought,78762,4
78764,"the 3XL wasn't large enough for my husband, so I'll have to let it out, but it's a nice match to an Italian tie he has.",78764,4
78765,"This is the first Vera Bradley purse I've purchased so I can't really say anything about it's authenticity, but I love the bag.",78765,4
78765,Plenty of room and pockets.,78765,4
78765,The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the inside had a VERY strong and unpleasant odor when I received it.,78765,4
78765,Almost like a musky/mothball smell.,78765,4
78765,I don't know if this is typical for VB or not.,78765,4
78765,"It made all the items I keep in the purse smell weird too so I ended up putting a cling free dryer sheet inside the bag for several days, and it did help.",78765,4
78765,The bag smells much better now.,78765,4
78766,Good gift for flamingo lovers!,78766,4
78766,Very thin and lightweight.,78766,4
78767,Very nice belt and I like the way the belt adjusts to any tightness.,78767,4
78767,"However, the release lever is kinda tricky to operate if the belt is adjusted for a tight fit.",78767,4
78767,To get it to release then you need to grasp the belt on both sides of the ratchet contact point and push towards the ratchet point (releasing pressure on the ratchet point) while pulling out on the release lever.,78767,4
78767,This sounds difficult but its not.,78767,4
78768,"my son loved, and it works pretty just double check the size (it is small)",78768,4
78769,First review: I am sad that I have to give these earrings a negative review.,78769,4
78769,They are really cute but the first time I tried to put them on the post bent and almost snapped off.,78769,4
78769,The seller contacted me and said that they had redesigned the earrings and they would like to send me a new pair for free.,78769,4
78769,It was such a sweet gesture.,78769,4
78769,I got the new ones and I have to say- they are MUCH better.,78769,4
78769,The post is curved to lay along the back of your ear lobe and support the weight of the earrings.,78769,4
78769,The only downside is that they still swing down so that they are not laying against your lobe like they should and swing down.,78769,4
78769,That happens with these kind of earrings all the time.,78769,4
78769,However the workmanship and post design makes these a great buy.,78769,4
78770,Gave it to my son.,78770,4
78771,"This doesn't feel like it will last forever, and the fringe is weirdly static-y.",78771,4
78771,The colour is also a much brighter red then expected.,78771,4
78771,I used this for a last minute Scarlet Witch (movie) cosplay and was pretty happy with it.,78771,4
78771,"I was also able to wash it in a washing machine (cold, delicate cycle, in a lingerie bag) and hang it to air dry with no issues.",78771,4
78771,I originally ordered an XL (my junior's size at that time) but found it hung a bit too loose.,78771,4
78771,The large fit much better.,78771,4
78771,"Otherwise, it looks great and I expect to wear it around casually, too!",78771,4
78771,"I would even purchase another if they offered it in more colours, or without fringe.",78771,4
78772,Hat is great as long as it is a magic or zzyx...sometimes they're not.,78772,4
78772,"Overall, a good experience this time.",78772,4
78773,Roomy & easy to wash,78773,4
78774,It was great just to long my baby is short but other then that is was perfect,78774,4
78775,"I am enjoying this cardigan, although it's not as heavy as I thought.",78775,4
78776,A beautiful dress high quality.,78776,4
78776,Used for my wedding but changed the straps to a halter top.,78776,4
78777,This worked great for travelling.,78777,4
78778,"Bought a medium which is my size and it was too small, so I'm returning it and going up one size bigger.",78778,4
78778,"Good quality, nice fabric",78778,4
78779,These shoes are exactly what I was looking for!,78779,4
78779,They're a good weight for their size.,78779,4
78779,Listen to the comments and order a half size up.,78779,4
78779,I wear a 7.5 and I ordered an 8.,78779,4
78780,"Very cute, soft, I love the style but it runs super small.",78780,4
78780,I usually wear an XL and I had to order a 3XL and it still fits snug.,78780,4
78782,(I wear a U.S. size 12.,78782,4
78782,)Fit well although a little short waisted as many of these dresses seem to be.,78782,4
78782,Didn't like the bow in the back so removed it and that was not a problem.,78782,4
78783,The bows come out of the band so we have come close to losing a few but they are incredibly adorable,78783,4
78784,"Watch the wire wants to turn, otherwise it is beautiful.",78784,4
78784,I am looking for another chain to put this on.,78784,4
78785,was perfect for my needs.,78785,4
78786,"Am 5'3"" and fits comfortably!",78786,4
78787,"I was sent the wrong swimsuit in the wrong size; however, I'm actually glad I was sent the wrong size because it fit really well and if I had gone bigger it wouldn't have fit.",78787,4
78787,I'm also still satisfied with the design even if it wasn't what I ordered.,78787,4
78787,"The suit is made well, and besides he product mishap, I am happy with my order!",78787,4
78789,"LIGHT,EASY TO PUT ON GLASSES, GREAT FOR DAY TIME SEEING,AT NIGHT GREAT FOR ON COMING LIGHTS,ONLY PROBLEM BLOCKS SEEING THE WHITE LINES ON THE ROAD,FAST SERVICE THANKS",78789,4
78790,"The small was still big and the coat feels good though, not to thin!",78790,4
78791,Cute and the right size.,78791,4
78792,love the material bottoms,78792,4
78793,Decent hoodie for the price.,78793,4
78794,"Its such a unique bracelet , I love it , An it was so admired by my Daughter ,  so I  got one for my Daughter too.",78794,4
78798,The bottoms fit really well .,78798,4
78798,The top was a bit bigger than expected in both  the medium and large .,78798,4
78798,Definitely good for bustier women .,78798,4
78799,It is comfortable and can be dressed up with accessories for formal or dressed down for casual.,78799,4
78800,I love these but i think the breathable mesh omes fit better.,78800,4
78800,These are a bit snug in the jewels but soft against the skin.,78800,4
78802,As can be expected for the price.,78802,4
78802,The quality is not the best but it does keep husband nice and warm.,78802,4
78804,"the shirt is really soft but i wish i could wear as a dress, i'm just to tall.",78804,4
78805,"The first pair we got, the light one shoe drop working after 3weeks.",78805,4
78805,Amazon sent another one.,78805,4
78805,We'll complain about the shoes but not Amazon.,78805,4
78806,Pay attention to latching it in before you secure the clasp.,78806,4
78806,You can screw it up which will cause it to randomly open.,78806,4
78807,Really helped with post partum healing.,78807,4
78807,"Not always the most comfortable on the skin, so I wore it on the outside of shirt and it was perfect",78807,4
78808,"The style is unique and gorgeous, it's a beautiful top.",78808,4
78808,"Some of the lace is (purposely) detached and hangs somewhat oddly, but other than that i love it",78808,4
78809,"Looks like good quality for such a cheap price, very statistfied with this product !",78809,4
78810,"The dress is as pictured...very cute, but definitely a little on the cheap side.",78810,4
78810,"I'm usually a 4-6 in dresses, so I ordered the medium.",78810,4
78810,"It's almost too tight, which makes it a little bit more sheer than I would like.",78810,4
78810,"It is a very flattering fit, however, so I'm keeping it.",78810,4
78810,I would recommend sizing up if you have a body type other than straight & narrow and don't want this to be too form-fitting.,78810,4
78811,"A very good fit for a 6'3"" 250lb+ son.",78811,4
78813,easy to take with you,78813,4
78814,quality good but too long for petites,78814,4
78815,"I usually buy large for my swim suit, but this is one is smaller...",78815,4
78815,I had to return my first order to get the next size XL.,78815,4
78815,but when you get the right size is way cute and I love it!,78815,4
78817,This is a clear example that going for better products is a wise choice.,78817,4
78817,I bought these insoles along with a pair of cheaper ones and definitely love these ones.,78817,4
78817,My plantar fasciitis issues have decreased and I feel heel support as well.,78817,4
78817,"From now on, this will be my brand to get.",78817,4
78818,"These are great, I only reduced the rating bc my son managed to fall and break a pair and when I replaced them the size was slightly different.",78818,4
78818,"Thankfully my optician had mercy and cut new lens without charging me full price, but as a fall back, buy a second pair at the same time as you buy the first.",78818,4
78818,"Hopefully you won't need them but its worth it, especially compaired to the cost of frames at big name optical shops, your still going to save a bundle.",78818,4
78819,It fit both me and my boyfriend well.,78819,4
78819,"However, it only covers to the base of your neck.",78819,4
78819,It is true that there is a strong chemical smell attached to it when you first remove it from the original packaging.,78819,4
78819,"However, a couple of washes took care of that.",78819,4
78819,One big complaint is that it took more than 4 weeks to arrive.,78819,4
78819,"When I saw where the package originated from, I understood why.",78819,4
78819,It came all the way from China!,78819,4
78820,Material is pretty thin and a little see-through in the right lighting.,78820,4
78820,But could be paired with a set of leggings as it is a tunic length.,78820,4
78821,But I do like them.,78821,4
78821,"As a 5'5"" person, these are WAY too long.",78821,4
78821,"I rolled them up, and they are cute,  but it defeats the skinny jean look.",78821,4
78821,"The inside of the denim has a ""dirty"" wash, which isn't very attractive, and unavoidable when you're forced to roll them.",78821,4
78821,"Otherwise, they seem of nice quality and are good jeans!",78821,4
78822,"Gift to a 5'11""/190lbs long waisted gal.",78822,4
78822,"The Large fit great, no problems with calves fitting (but can see why maybe loose on skinny calves).",78822,4
78822,"Loves higher waist as she's long waisted, and how they make her look.",78822,4
78822,Hasn't worked out in them yet - will update!,78822,4
78823,This will be my second time buying this braclet the first time I loved it as a ankle braclet for the summer but I broke it taking it off.,78823,4
78823,So cute for the money,78823,4
78825,These are a little on the small side BUT I wasn't surprised since my husband wears CK underwear and these are cut similar to a pair he's had in the past.,78825,4
78825,They're suppose to be snug and just cover everything.,78825,4
78825,My son doesn't seem to mind he's just happy to have underwear like Daddy's but I prefer the other pairs I ordered with the slightly longer legs.,78825,4
78825,For reference my son is 38 lbs and I bought the 4/5.,78825,4
78827,"Delivery was Swifts and the set is nicely presented, but we had to super-glue one of the colored cufflink inserts.",78827,4
78827,That seems to have done the trick and dapperness ensued at once.,78827,4
78828,"Worked great for my solos 4th, Vets Day, etc.",78828,4
78829,Got a hole in 5 min,78829,4
78830,This is a cute coverup.,78830,4
78831,Perfect fit for my phone.,78831,4
78831,"Quality is pretty good; although, after about a month of continual use, the sitching in some areas, particularly the flap, are starting to come undone.",78831,4
78831,The pockets are nicely sized for credit cards or hotel key cards.,78831,4
78831,The case is durable and has protected my phone from a few falls.,78831,4
78832,"On a smaller side but for the price, I was happy with the purchase and it arrived sooner than expected.",78832,4
78834,Purchased this dress for a party.,78834,4
78834,"The side slits were really high, very low cut in the front and bares a lot of midsection so u can't be shy about showing your skin if u intend to wear this dress.",78834,4
78834,The quality of the material was nice considering the price and it was overall the dress was very flattering to my body and I got many compliments so I am very pleased with my purchase,78834,4
78835,Very light weight and its so easy to change from one purse to another!,78835,4
78836,"It looks nice and was packaged well, just a little tight around the belly.",78836,4
78837,"somewhat snug, but tbh that helps them stay up.",78837,4
78837,perfect color and very comfy <3,78837,4
78839,Nice fabric and cut.,78839,4
78839,"I'm 6'5""/230lb and XL fit as expected.",78839,4
78839,"Sleeves were great, length average (could be longer in my case).",78839,4
78839,Nervous to wash..will update after a few washes and hang drys.,78839,4
78839,Overall: Recommend for price,78839,4
78840,I absolutely love how comfortable these babies are!,78840,4
78840,They're so soft and feel so wonderful hugging on the body.,78840,4
78840,They have a nice length on my legs and they fit just right.,78840,4
78840,I ordered the plus--one size fits all--due some of the other reviewers saying they were too small for people who generally wear Lg/XL leggings so I'm glad I made that choice.,78840,4
78840,However I feel as if anyone who wears anything over an XL in other leggings might not be able to squeeze their booty into these so be careful because it does say ONE SIZE.,78840,4
78840,The only downside to these leggings....they're a little see through.,78840,4
78840,Luckily I wear long tank tops and tunics that cover my butt so I've decided to keep these cause there so dang comfy!,78840,4
78841,I got these earrings as a gift for a friend.,78841,4
78841,They are really beautiful.,78841,4
78841,"The problem is they won't stay in the ""up"" position on her ear?",78841,4
78841,I plan on getting myself a pair and see if I can figure out why she is having this problem.,78841,4
78842,It could be a little wider but I really like the design and quality.,78842,4
78843,Not as low cut as it appears on the model,78843,4
78844,It has a soft comfortable fabric,78844,4
78845,"These are nice, they remained soft after being washed but did shrink a bit causing them to be a bit snug (hence the missing star).",78845,4
78845,My son has chunky thighs so I'm not sure if others have the same experience.,78845,4
78845,"Still, they are a great deal for the price!",78845,4
78846,Very cute but a little small-  order a size up!,78846,4
78847,"Really cute, but the sleeves are kinda short if you have long arms.",78847,4
78847,At least they're lace and not solid!,78847,4
78848,This is a nice skirt.,78848,4
78848,I got it for my daughter who is 11.,78848,4
78848,She is very very thin and petite.,78848,4
78848,It fit perfectly for her.,78848,4
78848,"She wears a size 10 in her jeans and other clothes, and I ordered a 10 in this skirt.",78848,4
78848,And it fit just right.,78848,4
78849,I did find that my hair would snag and pull then off my ear.,78849,4
78849,Besides that I loved them!,78849,4
78850,Super cute but a little small and there's no clear front or back side.,78850,4
78850,If it had more stretch then it'd be perfect.,78850,4
78851,"Very sweet, quaint look.",78851,4
78851,Quality is beautiful in person.,78851,4
78851,The ties under the chin can be a little bit tough with a wiggly baby but if you work fast they're fine.,78851,4
78851,"Once tied baby couldn't get the bonnet off and/or forgot about it, which was nice.",78851,4
78851,It was able to provide all day sun protection without having to be adjusted constantly.,78851,4
78851,Definitely a purchase I'm happy with.,78851,4
78852,"Decent price, runs a little tight probably due to the sweat band inside the hat.",78852,4
78853,"I do like the bag, but there were no actual measurements  on the site the picture gave the impression it was much larger.",78853,4
78853,I purchased the bag because I was under the impression it was large enough to be used as a weekender bag.,78853,4
78853,It is a very nice bag I use it every day.,78853,4
78854,Fits big but it is super cute arrived before expected and I really like the color!,78854,4
78856,"I ordered this after being duped by a similar purchase advertising the same photo, but delivering a ghastly substitute.",78856,4
78856,(FYI:  do NOT order the Pakula version of this dress!),78856,4
78856,"It's beautiful, airy, and the same flattering color of blue as being advertised.",78856,4
78856,"I ordered the small, and it fits very well.",78856,4
78856,I'm pleased that it is not as see-through as I had expected.,78856,4
78856,"And, if you're small-busted like me, you could even get away with going braless.",78856,4
78856,Definitely worth the money!,78856,4
78857,Overall I think this is a great deal for a high quality and fashionable purse.,78857,4
78857,I love how this purse looks.,78857,4
78857,People are always telling me that they love my purse and asking me where I bought it.,78857,4
78857,My grandma even asks me when I'm going to get a new one so she can carry this one!,78857,4
78857,The long strap included with the purse allows a nice touch of variability from the smaller handles.,78857,4
78857,The quality of this purse looks very expensive.,78857,4
78857,My mother couldn't believe how cheap I did get this purse for.,78857,4
78857,The only thing that bothered me about this purse is that it smelled.... strange when I received it.,78857,4
78857,Although most of that smell dissipated within a few days.,78857,4
78858,Holds 2 thin pair.,78858,4
78858,Only holds small frames.,78858,4
78861,"I bought the xxl due to the fact that, in the past XLs have fit a bit snug.",78861,4
78861,while this was a bit loose on me it was definately sized XXL,78861,4
78862,pretty but i'm not quite sure their worth the price i paid for them.,78862,4
78862,For some reason expected them to be a little larger.,78862,4
78863,Shirt looks like the picture I brought a bigger size because of reviews should have went with my actual size,78863,4
78864,"I love it, wish I had brought more than one.",78864,4
78865,Much darker maroon/burgundy than it appears in the picture.,78865,4
78865,"Very lightweight, like t-shirt material with a thin fleece lining.",78865,4
78865,Love the plaid lining on the hood!,78865,4
78866,Shrunk after washing and a little too short for maternity.,78866,4
78867,I wish the sole was thicker padded,78867,4
78868,It is a nice looking watch and came in a beautiful fancy box.,78868,4
78868,is a perfect gift.,78868,4
78868,It is bigger than a regular sized watch and  relatively heavy for a small wrist.,78868,4
78868,It does not look cheap and all the dials work well.,78868,4
78868,Would be nice to include a watch kit to remove links.,78868,4
78868,Overall a wonderful buy.,78868,4
78869,Super cute and the image is well printed.,78869,4
78869,The material is super stretchy so it's really comfortable.,78869,4
78869,It fit perfect in the chest but was baggy in the belly.,78869,4
78869,I prefer my shirts a little more snug but all in all it was good.,78869,4
78869,Have washed it a few times and it hasn't shrunk or lost color.,78869,4
78870,Cuff of arms are a little big but otherwise it was great,78870,4
78871,"Order two sizes up, way way too small ..",78871,4
78872,Surprised by the material.,78872,4
78873,"What I expected because I have another pair, just different color like them.",78873,4
78873,"However, I did not realize they were so glitzy, would have preferred less bling.",78873,4
78873,Picture did not show this that much.,78873,4
78873,"Arch support does not meet arches as well as my other pair, but is fine",78873,4
78874,Needs more taper in legs other that they are fine,78874,4
78875,"Love it, just was smaller than thought so only gave 4 stars.",78875,4
78876,Caution... the sizes listed for the item are asian size.,78876,4
78876,You need to order minimum one size up from your normal wear.,78876,4
78876,(Unless your asian of course.),78876,4
78877,I can at least wear a few of these.,78877,4
78878,"Less organza, more mesh or net.",78878,4
78878,"Otherwise, it's a very cute skirt.",78878,4
78879,My wife loved it  looks good and well made will buy again different color,78879,4
78880,"Really nice they look really good
Color does come off after a while so my sis added clear acrylic nail polish so color won't come off but for price and for the amount yoir getting its pretty good",78880,4
78881,My daughter constantly pulls her bibs off and now thanks to this bib she can't anymore.,78881,4
78881,We ordered 3 more!,78881,4
78882,I returned this because the shine of it made it feel dressier than for the event I wanted to wear it too.,78882,4
78882,Mine was also more blue than black and I love her black top in the main photo paired w/ this.,78882,4
78882,"If I had somewhere to wear it, or didn't normally spend my days chasing two wild boys I probably would have kept it.",78882,4
78882,"The younger, maiden form of myself would have loved it.",78882,4
78882,The mother finds it less practical.,78882,4
78882,(Please put pockets in everything.),78882,4
78884,It arrived quickly and was exactly as expected.,78884,4
78885,"Very nice outfit but the chest area did not fit my wife well, the breast area is too small.",78885,4
78886,Suit ran a little large overall and especially in the bust.,78886,4
78886,Wish I would have purchased one size smaller.,78886,4
78887,They seem to be made well.,78887,4
78887,I ordered these for my son's costume and the top of the boots is big for his calves.,78887,4
78887,"After reading the reviews on how they run small by a size, I ordered them 2 sizes bigger than what he wears.",78887,4
78887,They fit with no room for further growth.,78887,4
78888,purchased for my grandson and he loves them,78888,4
78889,Great leg warmers for my 2 year old daughter.,78889,4
78889,My only complaint is the don't stay up on her leg.,78889,4
78889,I'm pulling them up all day.,78889,4
78890,"These are adorable, but they were much larger than I expected.",78890,4
78890,The strap does help keep them on.,78890,4
78890,"Make sure to think of that, but I do love these because they are so cute.",78890,4
78891,A little more on the thin side than what I expected.,78891,4
78893,Very cute but runs a little small.,78893,4
78895,I absolutely love my new jeans the color is amazing.,78895,4
78895,The only downside is the hole for the knee is rather wide and oddly Placed to the side more.,78895,4
78895,I'm still in love with them but I will probably sell the lace underneath over the knee.,78895,4
78897,The dress is beautiful looks just like the picture.,78897,4
78897,The dress did run a bit smaller for the navy blue one.,78897,4
78897,I ordered the size 10 first which was too tight in the chest area.,78897,4
78897,I did up to a size 12 that was a bit loose in the chest area but it was okay.,78897,4
78897,My daughter is 5'1 so i didn't have a problem with the length.,78897,4
78897,She wore it for her father daughter dance and everyone loved it.,78897,4
78898,I think this is a nice shirt especially for the price I ordered in blue.,78898,4
78898,I bought this  in a large and just a little tight in the arms and chest I'm a little chesty though.,78898,4
78898,Overall a nice casual shirt.,78898,4
78899,I like this shirt but need to exchange for a smaller size.,78899,4
78899,It definitely runs big.,78899,4
78899,I am usually a medium but a small in this shirt,78899,4
78900,"The fit is a little snug, but it will do.",78900,4
78901,It is what i looking for!,78901,4
78901,but it is too big to me...,78901,4
78902,It fit great the material is smooth and it looks great.,78902,4
78902,"It does fit me a little small, but I'm just used to that in all dress type things.",78902,4
78902,"I have a small chest and waste but my hips and butt are rather large, so when it comes to ordering anything I always know it's gonna fit me a little tight or short in that particular area.",78902,4
78902,I paired it with a beautiful pair of thigh hiGhs and it looked amazing.,78902,4
78904,"This is a sweet, light top...I use as a tunic not a dress.",78904,4
78904,Most tunics are too short for what I prefer so I switched my search to mini-dresses  came up with a few great ones.,78904,4
78904,This is very nice as a tunic for me.,78904,4
78905,Wore it with my boots.,78905,4
78906,too small but well made,78906,4
78907,"love it, but a little small",78907,4
78908,Nice shiny chain and sparkling bright stone.,78908,4
78909,I love this dress and will buy it in other colors.,78909,4
78909,"It does need to be belted, as it has a strange seam in the middle that's not overly flattering.",78909,4
78909,"However, adding a waist belt will help make the look.",78909,4
78909,"I also bought a petticoat to go under it, which really makes it pop as a 1950's dress, however it looks great without the petticoat too.",78909,4
78910,My wife likes it.,78910,4
78911,Based on the reviews I ordered an XL.,78911,4
78911,"I'm 5'5"" 36-27-42 and my shoulders are kinda broad.",78911,4
78911,"It doesn't fit as big as I prefer (too snug on the shoulders), but I expected it.",78911,4
78911,Definitely is not as loose as the picture.,78911,4
78911,I've washed it a few times and I can't really tell if it's really dark blue or black.,78911,4
78911,"I don't really care for chiffon kimonos, so this cotton-like fabric is really great!",78911,4
78911,"It's a great length, ending below my knees.",78911,4
78911,"Over all I would say that it's great for the price, but if you want it to fit like the picture you need to be way tiny!",78911,4
78912,I think it's  great!,78912,4
78912,Material is a little things but I love it!,78912,4
78912,I got one for a friend too for Christmas.,78912,4
78913,I love this accessory.,78913,4
78913,but it is not staying clipped.,78913,4
78913,"I'll try it again with something else but no, it doesn't stay clipped.",78913,4
78914,Bought several colors of this belt.,78914,4
78914,Elastic is strong enough to hold your slacks up.,78914,4
78915,The print is beautiful.,78915,4
78915,I don't really care for the back of the neck on this.,78915,4
78915,It is cut a little strange.,78915,4
78915,It is also very large.,78915,4
78915,I ordered a medium and easily could've sized down to a small.,78915,4
78917,Fsbric is only fair quaity.,78917,4
78918,I got it as a Christmas present and my friend love it.,78918,4
78918,Super soft and cute.,78918,4
78918,"Not for a supper cold day,  but it makes a statement.",78918,4
78919,"A little small, but I've seen worse.",78919,4
78919,Really cute and soft.,78919,4
78920,"I love this wallet, it's exactly what I was expecting.",78920,4
78920,"Its sturdy, stylish, and I get tons of compliments on it.",78920,4
78921,Beautiful but WAY too big,78921,4
78922,It fit as expected it's a cute shirt I would buy a bra for a deep V shirt however I wore it with out a bra it still looks cute.,78922,4
78923,Head hole is a tad small- making it hard to remove and not mess up your hair.,78923,4
78923,So just know that going in or don't care!,78923,4
78924,Good item for the price.,78924,4

78933,Kept me warm in freezing weather.,78933,4
78933,I just don't like the smell of the material that linger even after few washes.,78933,4
78934,"Ladies, an L is really an M.  Too small but the look and feel is nice.",78934,4
78936,The hat works fine.,78936,4
78936,"It is for medium size heads, I am larger.",78936,4
78936,The lights work fine and I hope to wear the hat at an event.,78936,4
78936,The hat is not a 'one size fits all' though.,78936,4
78937,"Much nicer in person, although one of the inner pockets already has a tear in it.",78937,4
78938,The socks are not all evenly sized.,78938,4
78938,A few pairs were a bit small.,78938,4
78938,The rest fit as expected.,78938,4
78938,"Overall, though, the socks are decent quality and can get a bit of attention.",78938,4
78938,"They're good and fun to wear for events like holidays, trips to the museum, etc.",78938,4
78938,They're casual attention getters.,78938,4
78939,"Attractive, a little shear, but my husband likes it.",78939,4
78939,Easy enough to fix with white or nude undergarments.,78939,4
78939,"Cheap price, so if I damage it, I am not at a loss to bad.",78939,4
78940,"Beautiful dress in Navy blue, - nice fabric.",78940,4
78941,These do run small.,78941,4
78941,"I am a size 10 and ordered a large, and you cannot hold it closed.",78941,4
78941,It came much faster than expected.,78941,4
78941,Would buy from this company again.,78941,4
78942,What I expected for a cheap shirt 3 stars.,78942,4
78942,Have it an extra star for the side pockets.,78942,4
78942,I got the red and black.,78942,4
78943,"I wear small, that's why ordered Large and it fits just right.",78943,4
78943,It's ok. A bit thin material.,78943,4
78943,But price/money - it's a great buy!,78943,4
78944,The shirt is kind of tight in the sleeves/shoulders but that's as I expected from most clothes I buy from Asian suppliers.,78944,4
78946,I'm not sure how great this would work as a swimsuit but it's great for a costume.,78946,4
78946,Material is not cheap but mermaid material is a bit thin.,78946,4
78946,Bra part is built really well!,78946,4
78946,Here is some sizing help.,78946,4
78946,"Size large will fit: 34D, 34C, 36C,36B, 38B very well.",78946,4
78946,Waist 37 inches and up.,78946,4
78946,Hips 36 inches and up a little.,78946,4
78946,I am 5 foot 2.,78946,4
78946,130lbs 34D and large fit everything but my non curvy hips (too much fabric).,78946,4
78946,Cut of the bottom is brief style.,78946,4
78946,All in all excellent for a costume.,78946,4
78947,Was a gift for my daughter and she loves it,78947,4
78948,I'm 5'6 weight 128 i took a size M and the top was to big but the bottom fit as expected.,78948,4
78949,"A little chunky to be realistic on the side of the nose, so I use it as a septum.",78949,4
78949,"You can use it as a lip piercing, that would look good too.",78949,4
78949,It comes in a pack of two.,78949,4
78952,I expected this bag to be a lightweight nylon so was surprised to discover it's a heavier canvas like fabric.,78952,4
78952,I like all of the compartments and the blue color is very attractive.,78952,4
78952,I have found the zippers to be a bit stubborn at times which is why I'm not giving it five stars.,78952,4
78952,It holds a lot of stuff and would even be a good small carry on bag.,78952,4
78953,Everything about the shirt is great except the fit is a little small.,78953,4
78953,I am scared to put the shirt in the dryer bc if it shrinks at all it will be to short.,78953,4
78953,Recommend this shirt but if you like your shirts to hang to mid butt/ right below hip bones or long get one size larger.,78953,4
78954,"Comfortable, but lights are starting to have issues.",78954,4
78954,It seems one of the shoes has a couple of lights that aren't turning on after a full charge.,78954,4
78955,It looks cuter in the picture.,78955,4
78955,This is a polyester blend and runs a bit small.,78955,4
78956,The only concern is that it the colors fade from the chlorine in the pool.,78956,4
78957,ring is beautiful and definitely will be ordering another in the future,78957,4
78958,IT FIT AS EXPECTED,78958,4
78959,"I had to buy a small...normal size medium....I had to really dress the up because it's so plain....almost disappointed that the top come off looking like a standard sports bra and the skirt want right enough for what I think it should be....nonetheless, I liked it generally, you just really have to dress it up",78959,4
78960,"Wallet came a day early and undamaged, and looks just like it does in the photos.",78960,4
78960,"The fabric and stitching are well-done, nothing loose or out-of-place.",78960,4
78960,"I'm satisfied with the color and body overall, and the main pocket spaces are large enough to fit (and zip up with) my iPhone 6+, even with a case on it!",78960,4
78960,My only issue is that the wallet doesn't have some of the features listed.,78960,4
78960,"There are 8 card slots instead of 12 (and I can confirm that they're a little tight, as others have mentioned), and there is no clear view slot (not a big deal for me, though I admit I would've liked a clear view slot to showcase photos).",78960,4
78960,"Also, the two center-most pocket divisions are not sewn into the bottom of the wallet, so there's a small gap beneath them.",78960,4
78960,"I don't have any huge issue with this, but it's worth noting.",78960,4
78960,"Conclusively, it's a well-made wallet.",78960,4
78960,"Haven't taken it out to test durability or anything (I'm a student with a heavy bag and a testy route around school, so we'll see), but it seems as if it'll hold up, as there aren't any loose threads or stitchings that might pose a problem.",78960,4
78960,"If there are any changes, I will update my review accordingly.",78960,4
78961,Fabric is not thick.,78961,4

78962,Love the shirt but it's too big.,78962,4

78962,But still a cute shirt can't wait till wear it.,78962,4
78963,Love the 2 pack.,78963,4
78963,I didn't realize the silver has flecks of silver sparkle.,78963,4
78963,It didn't show up in the purchasing picture.,78963,4
78963,I think I'm going to like it though.,78963,4
78964,"Great material,  nice colors, only problem was that it ran a bit small",78964,4
78965,The fit around the waist was as expected but it is not as long as the picture which is kind of a bummer since I wanted to control my bottom tummy more.,78965,4
78965,It is made from good material.,78965,4
78966,The top could have been made a little better but overall I like it.,78966,4
78968,The outfit is really cute I wish the pants were more high waisted but I liked I'm not tiny I just had a baby but I worked it had to suck it in lol,78968,4
78969,Only drawback is the clasp is a bit clunky to open at times.,78969,4
78970,"Good quality but feel they run a little big, Giving these to my daughter and ordering size M for myself",78970,4
78971,"The length was good, which I was worried about (I'm 5'8"", almost 7 months and ordered a M) but the bust is just tiny.",78971,4
78971,"I got this for my maternity photos and will still use it, but I recommend going even bigger than you think with the size.",78971,4
78973,"I like this hat very well,but should have measured my head first.",78973,4
78973,"I used another hat that fit snugly and used the size,but it was different then the Henschel.",78973,4
78973,Still a nice product though.,78973,4
78974,"Like it, but does run small.",78974,4
78975,"This is a huge pain in the neck to set up the first time, but works well.",78975,4
78975,You won't to switch it between your various suit cases.,78975,4
78975,"Instead, just keep it on one and it will be fine.",78975,4

78982,"If you are contemplating purchasing this dress, DO IT!!!!",78982,4
78982,I couldn't believe I bought my wedding dress for $100 when initially I planned to spend $1300.,78982,4
78982,"I couldn't be happier, and will post a picture after my July 30th wedding!",78982,4
78982,"Don't be alarmed when the dress arrives and smells kind of fishy (I was devastated, when I pulled it from the package and it smelled of fish), However, after a few internet searches it informs you that in China they have to use a specific pesticide when shipping things to the US, after hanging the dress up the smell went away in a few days.",78982,4
78982,"It smells great now, and is going to look amazing for my big day!",78982,4
78983,"Lived the shirt, bought for my 26 yr old daughter who is a size large in juniors so ordered a mens medium would suggest going up a size in this situation, she loved it so much won't let me return she just isn't going to put it in the dryer hahaha",78983,4

78994,The sneakers with memory foam were also winners and I wore them walking around Toronto all day without any discomfort!,78994,4
78995,I was a little surprised that the torso was so small.,78995,4
78995,I have a short torso and I can make it work but if you have a average or long torso this suit will not fit you.,78995,4
78995,The pattern is great and suit is a good quality.,78995,4
78995,The top is also a little small but I'm a D and can fit in it fine.,78995,4
78995,I ordered a medium but probably should have ordered a large.,78995,4
78995,I'm 5'6 and 127 pounds,78995,4
78996,"I'm 5' 7"" and weight 135 lbs right now.",78996,4
78996,I got the size Large and while it fits me it's pretty tight across the belly.,78996,4
78996,The photos make it look loose in the belly so I was kind of surprised by that.,78996,4
78996,I've just had a baby so I suppose it will fit better as my belly finishes shrinking down.,78996,4
78996,I also thought the sleeves would be longer but they are almost too short but will work.,78996,4
78996,I like the way the shirt looks though.,78996,4
78996,"And it just covers my bum, which is why I bought it.",78996,4

79000,"I am 5'4, 140 lbs post baby and had to take in the hips and shoulders.",79000,4

79002,I wear it with thigh high socks and boots.,79002,4

79009,She rejected them for this reason.,79009,4
79011,If you have have a big head this will not fit as shown.,79011,4
79011,It is still a nice had but because it runs small it does not bag up at the back,79011,4
79012,Good fit and color.,79012,4
79013,Fits small because I'm a size 6 and the dress is a size 10.,79013,4
79013,Other than that is absolutely beautiful!,79013,4
79014,I love the dress but it is actually a bit larger than I expected in the chest area.,79014,4

79014,I delayed it to get there on Monday because I was going to be gone all weekend and it got there on Saturday.,79014,4

79026,It is very cute with jeans.,79026,4

79041,These were only $14 for a pack of 8 and I believe them to be the same quality as the more expensive one.,79041,4
79041,"My only grip is that they are very thin, and rip easily.",79041,4
79041,My Van Gogh ones already have a hole.,79041,4
79041,"Although they are soft, they are more fashion than form, and I bought them knowing this.",79041,4
79041,"Do not expect to use these for bundling up during the winter, or walking around on a rugged floor, as they will get dirty on the soles and could result in them ripping.",79041,4
79041,"But hey, 8 socks for $14, so I'm not complaining (only a little)",79041,4
79042,"I'm glad I got the L/XL because they are pretty small (I'm about a size 4-6 and usually wear S-M) they feel well made, I wear them to bad and they are great for that!",79042,4
79043,Bright colors and nice looking.,79043,4
79043,I do think they run a little small.,79043,4
79045,Perfect gift for my friend!!!!!!!!!!!,79045,4
79047,an extra small would fit better but it was ok I loved it.,79047,4
79048,"Nice little black dress, it's  cute and sexy,I like everything about it ,no complain, just wish that is little more stretchy,.",79048,4
79048,But its not all up to this dress (I have to shred some pounds )  :),79048,4
79049,Fast shipping and correct item,79049,4
79050,"Once I figured out how to make them stay on my ears, I really like them.",79050,4
79051,Pretty difficult to screw up a black hoodie with a simple Deadpool symbol on the chest.,79051,4
79051,So I have no complaints.,79051,4
79052,Still love it very Fancy,79052,4
79053,The material is kind of odd on this.,79053,4
79053,Almost feels like athletic spandex.,79053,4
79053,I normally wear medium tops.,79053,4
79053,I bought a medium in this and there is no way you can wear normal shirt under it.,79053,4
79053,I wear a tank top only under this.,79053,4
79054,I wore this to a wedding and got lots of compliments!,79054,4
79055,What a beautiful and elegant piece.,79055,4
79055,Just wish they had more sizes.,79055,4
79055,"I ordered a size too small, so it's a little snug, but it's still very gorgeous.",79055,4
79055,"I've only had it for a few days, so I don't know how long it will last, but so far it's very gorgeous.",79055,4
79056,"Fits a little tight, so I would size up.. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5",79056,4
79058,nice material and very visible!,79058,4
79059,I bought it for my 10 year old grand daughter.,79059,4
79059,She wears it on her left pointer finger and loves it.,79059,4
79059,It is pretty neat.,79059,4
79059,"Update:  The cute, little ring broke in 2 after 4-5 days of wear.",79059,4
79059,I contacted the seller and they replaced the ring with a new ring.,79059,4
79059,Hoping this works better!,79059,4
79061,Very nice for the money,79061,4
79062,"Its a nice jacket but notice that this is juniors sizing, well fed american ladies with a european bust line, be sure to order the bigger size.",79062,4
79063,i like the shirt it looks great i would totally get another one.,79063,4
79063,the way it looked the shirt was a little pixelated however it was very a small detail,79063,4
79064,Pretty necklace but shorter then it appears in the picture.,79064,4
79064,Top layer hits me right between the collar bones.,79064,4
79065,Exactly 50 and there were a couple that had some difformitys but for a batch of its size it's expected!,79065,4
79065,I also got two different bar lenghts...,79065,4
79065,But otherwise love it,79065,4
79066,"La-la-la lovee these shoes, was was nervous about getting them but they fot so well and look so nice!",79066,4
79067,Not too snug or loose.,79067,4
79067,Not too warm on head.,79067,4
79068,"I did not think I could pull off this look for a funeral I attended, but I got the most compliments from wearing it.",79068,4
79068,"The one con that I could think of was that as soon as I took it out the package, the feathers were molting.",79068,4
79068,"Other than that, it fit fine (and I have a huge head), looked great, and made me want to wear this style a lot more.",79068,4
79069,Photo true to color tone!,79069,4
79071,Order one size larger than your street shoes!,79071,4
79071,"Good quality, comfy fit.",79071,4
79072,Does't go all the way to my ankles,79072,4
79073,Very beautiful and retro.,79073,4
79074,I very like .,79074,4
79076,I like this because it's a nice design and it looks really nice on.,79076,4
79076,"I'm 90lbs , 5 feet tall.",79076,4
79076,"The small was too tight in the butt and the actual length of the suit was super stretched it couldn't really get up to where it's supposed to.. returned it to get the medium which was better, but the torso's still too short (those two lines in the front - with the small buttons on them don't stretch).",79076,4
79076,I didn't fill out the bra/chest part because I have a small chest but it wasn't a problem because of the way the suit is shaped.,79076,4
79076,The straps are basically what keeps the suit up..,79076,4
79076,I hope the hooks that hold in the straps hold up and don't rip.,79076,4
79076,"It also covers your butt which is kind of suprising, but good it's what i was looking for.",79076,4
79076,This really is a beautiful suit but the fit is weird and I'm only able to wear it bc I'm short.,79076,4
79077,Comfy and great to wear with anything!,79077,4
79078,Product was as expected fit perfect look good,79078,4
79079,I ordered my size but it was too big.,79079,4
79079,Vey pretty and simple though.,79079,4
79080,"It is a bit itchy upon first wear, but after washing it, it feels just fine.",79080,4
79080,The package arrived just in time for the season premiere as well :D,79080,4
79081,"The top is really low cut so I had to wear it w an undershirt, but otherwise it was perfect!",79081,4
79081,So soft and comfortable!,79081,4
79082,Bought this for my fiance.,79082,4
79082,"It was a little snug on her, but she looked great, and most important, she said she felt sexy wearing it.",79082,4
79082,Unlike the previous reviewer I did receive the item pictured.,79082,4
79083,Satisfactory and well made.,79083,4
79084,It fit as expected because I ordered it two sizes bigger,79084,4
79085,"i love these shoes, they are surprisingly comfortable (nice cushy sole), so if i was just going to be wearing them to dinner party or to hang out at bar they would be great.",79085,4
79085,"HOWEVER, they are very high and i'll be doing a lot of dancing (at a Halloween concert) so i'm not sure how long i'll last in them, but they'll LOOK great!",79085,4
79086,These shoes are very well made and do not look cheap.,79086,4
79086,My daughter used them initially as part of her Halloween costume--Dorothy!,79086,4
79086,These can be kept and used as normal dress shoes rather than tossed in the dress up box.,79086,4
79086,"I purposely bought a 1/2 size larger in the event they were not true to size; however, they were too big as a result.",79086,4
79086,I would recommend buying actual shoe size as they appear to be true to size.,79086,4
79087,I am in my 30s and will be giving these earrings to a younger girl to enjoy.,79087,4
79087,But I believe for someone younger.,79087,4
79088,Strap broke pretty early upon buying it.,79088,4
79089,I didn't give it the full 5 only cause the fabric was very cheap.,79089,4
79089,Then again for what I paid I shouldn't expect much.,79089,4
79089,It got the job done.,79089,4
79091,Really like this belt.,79091,4
79091,The width is perfect with skinny jeans!,79091,4
79091,I am a size 10 and ordered the large which I needed to exchange for a medium.,79091,4
79092,"The gown was shipped quickly, it looks better than the picture, looks good on, well made.",79092,4
79092,Beautiful gown for the price!,79092,4
79093,"Yes very much so, it exceeded actually & the material is better than it looks on the image.",79093,4
79095,Bought the olive green color and looks exactly as the picture shown.,79095,4
79095,Mostly use it when fishing and/or kayaking.,79095,4
79095,"In terms of functionality of the hat:
- the top portion of the hat is soft so it allows it to form and sit nicely on the head
- the cap is firmer and large enough for shading from the sunlight
- it has an adjustable strap around the top portion that can be tightened/loosened to fit any head (my husband and I use this hat interchangeably so it's a great plus that we can both wear it comfortably and fit it to how we want)
- it  has a clip to clip onto shirts/clothes to prevent it from flying away.",79095,4
79095,"- has a back flap to cover and protect the neck

Problems I found wearing the hat:
- the flap on the back does help protect the neck area, however on very windy days, it always flips over and doesn't stay in place.",79095,4
79095,"I've tried using the clip as a barrier to prevent it from moving, but it doesn't really help.",79095,4
79095,The flap is also a bit too short to be placed underneath your shirt or jacket.,79095,4
79095,"So in this sense, it doesn't really help with protecting.",79095,4
79095,Overall it's a good hat.,79095,4
79095,Does keep a good amount of shading on hot days and it stays in place for the most part.,79095,4
79096,"i love the color, exactly as it shows the picture.",79096,4
79096,"The reason i gave it a four star is because my pom pom fell out, i was mad so i have to sew  it but other then that i like.",79096,4
79096,oh and shipping was fast so yeah,79096,4
79097,Thought it would be alittle darker but i love it besides that.,79097,4
79097,Alittle sheddy but packaged well with fast shipping.,79097,4
79098,"really nice gloves....but, I ordered a M and got an M, which fit my thumb and palm, but the other 4 fingers are at least 1/2 inch too long....does anyone have a remedy for this....I am thinking of taking the gloves to a seamstress and cutting off a 1/2 inch and resewing them.....other than that I, so far, like them.....it is not the glove mfgs fault that I have short finger.....but would be an interesting option as I am sure that I am not the only person with this problem.",79098,4
79100,took a little longer than expected but great product,79100,4
79101,I really like this top and the versatility of being able to use the sleeves as long or short.,79101,4
79101,"I love the color, I ordered blue.",79101,4
79101,It is very comfortable and fits nicely.,79101,4
79101,"I typically wear a medium, but I ordered a large per the size chart.",79101,4
79101,I like the way this top falls and the V is not too low.,79101,4
79101,"My only issue is that this top did not come with washing instructions or a tag listing the fabric, if it weren't for this, I probably would have rated the top 5 stars.",79101,4
79102,Pleasantly surprised by the quality.,79102,4
79102,Fits true to size.,79102,4
79102,You have to lace the string in the front yourself.,79102,4
79102,Ordered in black and I think white would not look good because of weird double layer in front of garment .,79102,4
79103,The fit of this nose ring is nice.,79103,4
79103,It hold close to my nostril and doesn't look like a giant hoop on my nose.,79103,4
79103,The flat backing is great to keep it tucked inside my nose & prevents it from falling out easily or rotating too much.,79103,4
79103,The only reason for the 4 star review is that I was expecting the color to be a little more variable in the rainbow colors represented in the picture.,79103,4
79103,"Although there is color to the ring, it seems to look more silver from far away instead of multicolor.",79103,4
79103,There also needs to be a decent amount of light reflecting on it to actually see the colors.,79103,4
79103,"I will say though that the paint on it has been holding up very well without any chipping or fading, even after being exposed to water and soaps from washing my face.",79103,4
79103,Also I have not noticed any allergic reactions towards my skin or greening of my skin where the ring touches.,79103,4
79104,So cute love it.,79104,4
79105,"Love it,  but shorter than I expected",79105,4
79106,Love the design but the fit was a bit snug.,79106,4
79106,I wear a large and purchase a extra large and was very glad I did.,79106,4
79106,I probably should have gotten the 2x since I normally like a looser fit.,79106,4
79106,I am on the smaller chest size but large in the arms and this scrub is just the right fit.,79106,4
79106,I just perfer a little more room.,79106,4
79106,"Love the design, do cute.",79106,4
79107,Colorful tie that looks good.,79107,4
79108,Comfortable and shapes/supports well.,79108,4
79108,A little long for my torso.,79108,4
79109,They tend to strethink out though.,79109,4
79110,"It came a week late, but the hat fits very well and the brim is quite wide.",79110,4
79111,"was hoping that I can wear this as a short dress, but it more like that I will have to put something else.",79111,4
79111,I am 5.7 and it's short for me.,79111,4
79111,but comfortable and looks great.,79111,4
79112,Received this shirt a week and a half before I expected it so that was a plus.,79112,4
79112,I read reviews to order up and that it ran small for many people.,79112,4
79112,"So I ordered a medium (I'm 5'7, 134lbs) Its a good length but I wouldn't mind if it were a litttttttle tighter around the waist area.",79112,4
79112,But I don't know if ordering a small would affect the length which is perfect as is.,79112,4
79112,The design looks exactly as pictured so there were no surprises.,79112,4
79112,It's a nice cotton material.,79112,4
79112,My shirt came with a card offering a discount on future orders and that was appreciated.,79112,4
79112,"Overall, very pleased with purchase.",79112,4
79113,This is my daughter's favorite quote from Anne of Green Gables.,79113,4
79113,She thinks it's very nice.,79113,4
79114,"Very good quality although slots are a little tight for cards, but I'm sure they'll stretch.",79114,4
79114,"I'd rather have them stuck IN my wallet, than falling OUT of my wallet.",79114,4
79115,It's a very nice dress.,79115,4
79115,Kinda  gaps  at the chest since I am  a bit smaller,79115,4
79116,"runs a little small, but good quality.",79116,4
79117,It was different than what I expected.,79117,4
79117,It's a piece of fabric folded in half with the ends sewn leaving a hole at the top of each end for your arms.,79117,4
79117,"It is unusual, but I like it.",79117,4
79118,"Ordered a medium, it came sooner than anticipated which was good.",79118,4
79118,I'm 5'6.5 / 34B.,79118,4
79118,"Suit was VERY SMALL, was going to return it (and seller was very responsive) however not worth sending it back overseas.",79118,4
79118,Gave it to my daughter.,79118,4
79118,Pretty well made for the price.,79118,4
79118,"Was excited so order another one in a L from my friends account to receive prior to vacation, same issue so now returning It.",79118,4
79118,(Bottoms were smaller than M not to mention the stitching/casing/elastic under the band and under chest) was completely twisted so you can't straighten.,79118,4
79118,Don't think I'll be ordering an XL.,79118,4
79118,Was really bummed since I was looking forward to the replacement.,79118,4
79118,"Seller great, product fit not so great :-(",79118,4
79119,I returned the shirt for a smaller size.,79119,4
79119,Roaman's clothing runs big.,79119,4
79121,This is a wonderful hat to have if you love the series!,79121,4
79121,Very spacious and comfortable to wear!,79121,4
79121,The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that all the logos and insignias are not sewn on but pasted on somehow.,79121,4
79121,"It makes the designs not as bolstered and it even looks like it starts to wear out quicker than other, more durable means.",79121,4
79121,"That aside, a magnificent buy!",79121,4
79122,I bought these to prevent future running injuries.,79122,4
79122,They were recommended by my orthopedic doctor.,79122,4
79122,"I believe they have helped to prevent injuries in the last couple of months I've had them, but they do not prevent injuries entirely.",79122,4
79122,I only ran a mile yesterday in them and I think I've torn a tendon in my leg.,79122,4
79122,They help but they don't work miracles!,79122,4
79123,I bought a 2 of these for SantaCon and didn't have the highest expectations for them.,79123,4
79123,Made of really cheap material and don't fit a normal adult head to well.,79123,4
79123,"But hey, for the price and considering its for a bar crawl, its a good deal.",79123,4
79123,"When i opened the box, to check them out, the 2 hats were completely different.",79123,4
79123,"Different size, material, and look.",79123,4
79123,"I mean they both looked like your typical Santa hat, but you could clearly tell they were 2 different hats.",79123,4
79123,Diddnt matter to us but just bringing it up.,79123,4
79124,Good for social meetings or for your job!,79124,4
79125,Fits great and very comfortable.,79125,4
79126,"The shipping label had an incorrect zip code on it which made it have to get forwarded, it actually got forwarded twice even with a corrected zip code, but it wasn't too much of a hassle because I just picked it up at the post office.",79126,4
79126,"Now, as for the item itself, it is super comfy, not as soft as I thought it'd be, but I still love it.",79126,4
79126,It's nice and cozy for when it's cold.,79126,4
79126,The buttons are just fine.,79126,4
79126,"I was one of the people that steered away from these because they had buttons instead of a zipper, but the buttons are actually fine, although now I accidentally try to grab a zipper instead of buttons because I'm so used to a zipper.",79126,4
79126,But I really love this kigu.,79126,4
79127,but were too small to for my son to wear,79127,4
79128,I love them just a little small.,79128,4
79129,Didn't quite hang as I hoped.,79129,4
79129,But nice fabric and would be cute in a larger size.,79129,4
79129,"I ordered Large and I'm 5'5"" 170.",79129,4
79130,a little big for my 10 week old but we will definitely get a lot of use out of it as she gets bigger,79130,4
79131,Good product at a reasonable cost,79131,4
79132,"The gold metal on the v neck and the drawstrings, I removed.",79132,4
79132,It made the dress look cheap.,79132,4
79132,"But as another reviewer said, luckily they came off easily.",79132,4
79133,Shirt a Lil bigger than expected,79133,4
79134,I wish I would have bought this sooner.,79134,4
79134,This gave me a lot of relief from pain and discomfort for the first couple of months after giving birth,79134,4
79135,Ordered a size larger than usual and they still rode up!,79135,4
79135,"Which is weird, as I buy active basic a lot and have actually LOST weight since my last order.",79135,4
79135,These also seem shorter than the usual... oh well!,79135,4
79135,Still great for use as an undershirt or with high-waisted skirts/shorts.,79135,4
79136,"Super nice, and VERY comfortable but it was a little too big.",79136,4
79136,Order a size smaller if you are unsure!,79136,4
79137,This tote is very cute in person but wow--it's bigger than I expected.,79137,4
79137,"It's almost too big for an every day bag, but if you like carrying a lot of items--this bag can handle it!",79137,4
79137,It looks well made and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it so far.,79137,4
79138,"Was perfect, I would order again",79138,4
79139,The Vegan Taxi Wallet is adorable.,79139,4
79139,"But I wonder how long it will last, compared to a leather Taxi Wallet.",79139,4
79140,"Girls' slip-on fashion sneaker is a pretty pink, but has no arch support.",79140,4
79140,"My niece loves them, though.",79140,4
79144,"it's nice, but I thought it was a sweater!",79144,4
79145,I read and read the reviews and came to the conclusion they may have run small.,79145,4
79145,So in ordered a size 2 when my 5 year old wears a size 1 in regular shoes.,79145,4
79145,They are too big but he is still able to wear them.,79145,4
79145,Rather he doesn't have much choice.,79145,4
79145,"Lol if you want them to wear them next year too, order a size up.",79145,4
79146,We got this for a picture recreation and it worked great.,79146,4

79147,"I'm 5'7, 140 lbs, normally a pants size 8, and ordered the XXL in navy blue.",79147,4
79147,"They are a bit loose, but suuuuper comfy!",79147,4
79147,Will order again in XL,79147,4

79148,They are real stone and are very pretty.,79148,4
79149,Nice color and great small handbag; would be ideal if it had a zipper or flap closure with an outside pocket.,79149,4
79150,My only issue is I wish I could get them a little larger.,79150,4
79150,"I have very sensitive feet and find them a little tight if I'm not moving around, but excellent as long as I stay on the move most of the time.",79150,4
79151,Great basic tank- especially for the price.,79151,4
79151,I received it much quicker than expected.,79151,4

79160,Very nice And color also will def be a attention grabber,79160,4

79162,I like the item very much.,79162,4
79162,"I have to mention that the settings for the crystals don't seem very secure, but if you are a gentle user of your jewelry go ahead and buy it.",79162,4
79162,"It is georgeous, if it is for a present have in account that it doesn't come with the gift box that Soufeel Promise when you purchase the item.",79162,4
79163,My son is 4yrs old and usually fits a 4T shirt and somewhere between a 3-4T pant.,79163,4
79163,The shirt fits perfectly.,79163,4
79163,"The pants are slightly long, but that doesn't really matter on pjs and he'll grow into them soon.",79163,4
79165,The top was large around back but the bottoms fit perfect.,79165,4
79166,"Good fit, but the colors seem to fade a bit when stretched over the thighs (and I'm 5'4"", 120lb).",79166,4
79166,Nice material bot not as soft as some others I own,79166,4
79167,"I really like the style and length, but it's cut too small in the chest, so it hangs awkwardly.",79167,4
79168,I bought 5 of these bracelets.,79168,4
79168,I'm giving the out as birthday presents to my sisters.,79168,4
79168,I kept one for myself.,79168,4
79168,The only thing is that the beads are green and not brown as I had hoped.,79168,4
79169,This outfit is absolutely adorable!,79169,4
79169,Material is soft and comfy.,79169,4
79169,Only problem is the size.,79169,4
79169,The 4 months - 12 months size would fit a toddler!,79169,4
79169,We decided to keep this one and ordered the 0-3 months size because we like the outfit so much.,79169,4
79169,"With my grandbaby being almost 4 months, we are hoping the sizes are still running large and fit.",79169,4
79170,Super cute and classic in black!,79170,4
79170,Just wish it had a little stretch to it,79170,4
79171,I started wearing this the day after delivery.,79171,4
79171,This is my first pregnancy so I am not sure if it helped or not but it made me feel good that I was being proactive so quickly after delivery.,79171,4
79171,It isn't comfortable enough to wear constantly but I found taking it off to nurse and sleep gave me enough break to keep it on the rest of the time.,79171,4
79171,I am 4 weeks post delivery and now only wear it a few hours a day.,79171,4
79171,I typically wore an XS-S clothing size pre pregnancy and in maternity clothes and the XS fits well.,79171,4
79172,Fits well not too snug I really like it,79172,4
79173,Based on other reviews I ordered a size larger than I usually wear and it paid off.,79173,4
79173,The fit was great,79173,4
79174,Purchased this to wear at a tribute band concert.,79174,4
79174,"It is very long on my 5'4"" torso, and the fit is snug.",79174,4

79174,"I wish the design was shorter, or the whole shirt was shorter by about 3"", but overall I love the shirt!",79174,4
79175,Edit 3/11/17 - I have worn this ring everyday for just shy of a year.,79175,4
79175,"When clean, it is still as beautiful as when I first bought it.",79175,4
79175,It holds its own quite well against jewelry store SS and white gold rings which are exponentially more expensive.,79175,4
79175,The blemish I mentioned.. well it must have been me just being picky and wanting my wedding band to be perfect.,79175,4
79175,"It's still there, but I don't notice it nearly at all anymore.",79175,4
79175,Upgrading review back to original 5 stars because of its longevity.,79175,4
79175,I don't expect to replace this ring in this life time.,79175,4
79175,If you're on the fence about getting this ring... Do it!,79175,4
79175,"I cannot say anything towards the longevity of the ring, but I can update in a few months after I am married and have worn it regularly.",79175,4
79175,But as first impressions..,79175,4
79175,I am in awe of this ring.,79175,4
79175,"Being able to purchase inexpensive quality rings  meant we could get the photographer that we wanted for our very low budget, DIY wedding.",79175,4
79175,"So pleased, blessed, and excited.",79175,4
79175,"Update: upon closer inspection, the ring has a blemish on it, circular discolored spot that I didn't notice before.",79175,4
79175,I still like the ring and will be keeping it..,79175,4
79175,But I couldn't give it 5 stars because it was quite noticeable.,79175,4
79177,It's a nice products enjoy not having my big wallet in my back pocket.,79177,4
79177,Made of good quality,79177,4
79178,"I had to wear leggings underneath because it was too short, but every where else fit nicely.",79178,4
79179,Some college kids jumped me because they thought this watch was real gold.,79179,4
79180,I thought it looked orange and it is.,79180,4
79180,Which I like but if you want red this is not red.,79180,4
79180,The pearls area little heavy but the overall look is very pretty.,79180,4
79181,"I got it in burgundy, really an eye catcher.",79181,4

79181,"Inexpensively made, good costume.",79181,4
79182,Sizes runs smaller then normal.,79182,4
79182,I returned it for a size up.,79182,4

79186,I love this cover.,79186,4
79186,The print is beautiful and it is so comfortable.,79186,4
79186,My only complaint is that it is a too big.,79186,4
79186,"I normally wear a large, so I got a large but really wish I would have gone with a medium.",79186,4
79186,I still wear it however.,79186,4
79187,I do like this wallet.,79187,4
79187,It can only fit so many cards.,79187,4
79187,"If you have one too many, it pops open.",79187,4
79187,So make sure you don't try to fit too many cards inside.,79187,4
79187,"Other than that, I like using it and it's sleek and stylish.",79187,4
79188,Very nice but runs really small,79188,4
79189,Nice but.....Some reviews said they were running large in contrast to what the size chart indicated.,79189,4
79189,My daughter is an average size 11 year old.,79189,4
79189,The medium which I ordered was more like a size 6/8.,79189,4
79189,Or maybe just a 6.,79189,4
79189,Afraid the large would still be too small.,79189,4
79189,Wish they made them for pre teens and teens.,79189,4
79190,Good enough for a night out on the town.,79190,4
79191,"The fabric is a bit stiff, not much stretch to it so I would definitely recommend ordering the size up.",79191,4
79192,Thicker than I expected.,79192,4
79193,I love it .,79193,4
79193,Its really comfortable and the material is amazing!,79193,4

79196,I bought it for my daughter to take infant photos.,79196,4
79196,They came out beautifully.,79196,4
79196,When you receive the tutu it will be flat.,79196,4
79196,"You will want to take the time to ""fluff"" it.",79196,4
79197,I actual like the fit.,79197,4
79197,It IS a bit large.,79197,4
79197,"I am a 6-8, 34D, normally wear a small.",79197,4
79197,It was a bit large in the shoulders but was not gaping.,79197,4
79197,"The only reason I returned it was this ""light blue"" is more sea-foam green and did not match the pants I bought at all.",79197,4
79197,I am going to reorder in a different color.,79197,4
79197,"The material is soft, not too thin and the ruching on the sides hides any little belly you might have.",79197,4
79197,This really is a great buy and I look forward to getting a new one.,79197,4
79198,Given as a gift.,79198,4
79199,"I am 5'11 and typically wear a size small, sometimes a medium depending on how it runs.",79199,4
79199,"I ordered this skirt in a medium and I could clasp and zip it, but I would have been more comfortable with another half an inch.",79199,4
79199,"I also had the skirt high waisted, which is what I prefer.",79199,4
79199,"The skirt was long enough to wear without heels, but I would have wanted another inch or two.",79199,4
79199,Of course I know this is asking a lot considering how tall I am.,79199,4
79199,I would have kept the skirt if it was just a little bit bigger.,79199,4
79199,Another note: I ordered the skirt in the army green color and it matched the picture.,79199,4
79199,I also liked that the material wasn't shiny like the other colors appear to be.,79199,4
79201,"Too big for a medium, need to size down, at least for me.",79201,4
79202,Bright print and soft fabric.,79202,4
79202,Look more expensive than they were - real bargain.,79202,4
79202,Nicely packaged in soft plastic bags.,79202,4
79202,Will not be ashamed to give as gift.,79202,4
79203,Good collection to have for any kind of wear,79203,4
79204,"Nice, just wish I was lighter skinned to match it a little more",79204,4
79205,"body length is ok, sleeves quite long for me, neckline too wide it falls over my shoulders",79205,4
79206,"Although I find no fault with this underwear, I'm not sure I can say ""I love it"" when thinking of underwear.",79206,4
79206,"However, this underwear does its job by doing what it is supposed to do.",79206,4
79206,"Other brands I've tried, and they are not ""discount"" brands, stretch around the legs almost as soon as I put them on.",79206,4
79206,The result is discomfort and having to pull up my underwear out of sight of others.,79206,4
79206,This underwear is excellent at retaining its elasticity and it is also very comfortable.,79206,4
79207,"Very soft, but runs small.",79207,4
79207,I haven't washed them yet so we will see how they hold up.,79207,4
79208,"I bought this as a gift, so I'm unsure how that person will react to it because their birthday is in 10 days.",79208,4
79208,"So far in my opinion, I think we will like it but it looks a little smaller than I anticipated.",79208,4
79209,I can wear them but I should have gotten them one size larger!,79209,4
79210,Shorter than it looks in the picture.,79210,4
79210,"A little more boxy, but still pretty.",79210,4
79211,"It''s large up top, but then it's snug through the hips.",79211,4
79213,The only reason that I'm giving 4 stars is because the material used.,79213,4
79213,It is a very flimsy material similar to what Halloween costumes are made of.,79213,4
79213,"Sizing is good, I'm 180lbs 5'4 & I purchased a size XL.",79213,4
79213,"Now if you're larger than a C cup, this may not be for you!",79213,4
79213,For obvious reasons lol,79213,4
79214,Isn't exactly the same as the pictures but pretty close to identical to the real and soft good for the price,79214,4
79215,It is a very nice shirt for my Dad.,79215,4
79215,He said he likes the way if fits and it looks nice as well,79215,4
79216,Color was a little different than photo.,79216,4
79217,pants but the legs were somewhat large.,79217,4
79218,Very comfortable- needed just a little more padding to be perfect.,79218,4
79218,I have a hard time wearing these without socks,79218,4
79219,Really slimes you down and a great suit for my body type.,79219,4
79221,so far so good...I like this T-shirt,79221,4
79223,Honestly does not look like the picture at all.,79223,4
79223,The bra part is padded and the cups for the breasts are absolutely HUGE.,79223,4
79223,Fortunately the padding is removable and it made it a little easier to wear.,79223,4
79223,"However, definitely not the same product as advertised.",79223,4
79223,The bottom lace is different and the cups are more rounded than in the photo.,79223,4
79223,It looks ok on me but definitely would need fashion tape to hold the excess cup near my armpit down,79223,4
79224,Size run a little small.,79224,4
79225,"Nice look- the material doesn not seem high quality but it's a
Cute beach cover up/sundress",79225,4
79226,Looks just as pictured.,79226,4
79226,It is a visor/headband.,79226,4
79226,"I have not worn it yet, but it looks like it would be a couple of times wear.",79226,4
79226,The colored glass-like material is fairly thin.,79226,4
79226,It does the trick for my futuristic costume.,79226,4
79227,"Great shoes laces, they are a bit wider than expected though which made them difficult to fit into my wife's smaller sized shoes.",79227,4
79227,"Just something to be aware of, it wouldn't stop me from buying them again though.",79227,4
79228,"36D and 6 pants, ordered a medium, fit great.",79228,4
79228,"Very cute, however the top is a bit off in the shaping.",79228,4
79228,"Worth the price, though.",79228,4
79229,"There is definitely some side boob going on, but it's the perfect beach top.",79229,4
79229,It's lightly padded too so you don't have to worry about that.,79229,4
79230,"These are great sunglasses, but beware unless you have a very large head to keep them on.",79230,4
79230,My daughter is a very tall young lady and these still didn't stay on her head.,79230,4
79230,They are very cute though if that one issue can be resolved.,79230,4
79231,Really cute but won't fit my two year old for a while.,79231,4
79232,love this dress it is very comfortable,79232,4
79233,Cute and Good Quality,79233,4
79234,"great fit, great quality and price",79234,4
79235,look really nice and it fits me just find,79235,4
79236,They fit me nice and look good with a pair of casual loafers and can also look good with a nice pair of sneakers and top.,79236,4
79236,They're pretty versatile just unbearable in colder weather.,79236,4
79237,"Thought ill try this color, Recently brought a stretching kit marble color which i love but brought from another seller.",79237,4
79237,Decided to try these from this buyer.,79237,4
79237,I Really like the colors and feel.,79237,4
79237,But one of my tapers were bent not a good look so im guessing the quality isn't the greatest but still good enough.,79237,4
79237,The color is beAutiful and its comfortable to wear.,79237,4
79237,I am a a 6G btw.,79237,4
79238,If your into that then these are for you.,79238,4
79238,The lenses are  plastic as is the frame however well-crafted and would certainly recommend at this price point !,79238,4
79239,"When I received this, I was a little desappointed, because it looks like cheap jewelry, nevertheless, when I Tried my, it looks nice.",79239,4
79241,"Fits slightly larger than expected, but that's not too bad.",79241,4
79241,"Wish it was a true fit, as she won't be able to wear it for a while.",79241,4
79242,buy a pair every year,79242,4
79243,cute pants great for girl scout uniform but sometimes the pants get really wrinkled after washing and drying and have to iron them.,79243,4
79243,"my daisy is 6 somewhat tall for her age and very thin, these pants in size 6 little girls fit just fine",79243,4
79244,I recommend getting it,79244,4
79245,This product was purchased as a 2016 Valentine's Day gift.,79245,4
79245,"This product is heavier than silk and could be worn during the Winter, Spring, & Autumn seasons.",79245,4
79246,Liked it but didn't love it.,79246,4
79246,"It was a bit heavier than I had hoped and a bit snugger, though I believe it was designed to be that way.",79246,4
79246,"It is very well made and a nice piece of geat, just wasn't exactly what I was looking for so I returned it.",79246,4
79247,These leggings are super cute and comfy and my daughter loves the feel of them.,79247,4
79247,The material is very light and stretchy and feel more like thick nylons than other leggings.,79247,4
79247,"Unfortunately they arrived with holes in the rear, and so i will be trying to exchange them.",79247,4
79247,Would get 5 starts except for the holes!,79247,4
79248,Smaller than expected but it does the job.,79248,4
79248,"They straps feel, look, and more than likely are cheap and they twist in a heartbeat.",79248,4
79248,Not a fan of the cheap metal that hold the straps either.,79248,4
79248,I got the blue color and it has variation that I didn't see on the pictures but it look nice and the color is pretty.,79248,4
79248,Got this to use at work from time to time carrying files and small equipment I use for my job.,79248,4
79248,Would I purchase another one?,79248,4
79249,This is a really cute shirt.,79249,4
79249,The material is not what i expected at all.,79249,4
79249,"It is also see through so you need to wear a tank top under it, but it is very very cute.",79249,4
79249,I received 3 compliments from people when I went out in public with it on.,79249,4
79249,They said it was cute.,79249,4
79249,"It has a band at the bottom, which I wasn't expecting.",79249,4
79249,I though the shirt would be more t shirt like and stretchy.,79249,4
79249,"It's not stretchy at all, but it is very loose and pretty.",79249,4
79249,I ordered a Medium when I'm generally a small and it fit nicely.,79249,4
79249,It was loose and cute and comfy all at the same time.,79249,4
79250,"The material is different from the real shirts, but I like how it feels.",79250,4
79250,"Size chart is accurate, it fit me well.",79250,4
79250,"Had some loose thread, but that's the only problem I had.",79250,4
79251,"Good fit, a little small on the bottom but overall happy with this purchase.",79251,4

79252,The top FIT perfect.,79252,4
79252,"The bottoms  were a little snug, I had to turn them into boy shorts/thong.",79252,4
79252,But I made it work and my husband didn't have any complaints.,79252,4
79253,"The top is a tad too tight, but the color is beautiful!",79253,4
79253,Exactly what I expected after reading reviews.,79253,4
79254,I bought this because of the low price.,79254,4
79254,I was thinking I'd try it out but expecting to return it based on the sizing reviews.,79254,4
79254,However I was pleasantly surprised!,79254,4
79254,"I ordered a size bigger because of the reviews, it is a little snug on the bottom and shorter than I imagined but the top fits perfectly.",79254,4
79254,The back is too low to wear a regular bra with.,79254,4
79255,"Wore well all night, except towards the end of the night I was getting chaffed on my neck",79255,4
79256,"nice quality, however there are no loops and since I am bigger in the hips than in the waist, they tend to sag..so keep that in mind..I have worn a few times.but because they sag, they aren't one of my favorite pant..",79256,4
79257,"Great, beautiful watch, but not waterproof or even resistant.",79257,4

79259,Materials and construction are fine.,79259,4
79259,The adjustment strap is just OK.,79259,4
79259,It is all synthetic material with no stretch.,79259,4
79259,Getting a good fit takes some adjusting and it tends to loosen up over time.,79259,4
79259,A bit too big but that has more to do with my really small head than the hat itself.,79259,4
79260,Good value for the money..,79260,4
79261,I have a small head but this hat fits well.,79261,4
79261,Great for running errands around town and comfy enough to lounge in as well.,79261,4
79262,This romper is really cute.,79262,4
79262,"However, the straps were a little bit hard to figure out at first.",79262,4
79262,Will probably look good with a light sweater over this.,79262,4
79263,I am finishing up a full work-day of wearing this bra.,79263,4
79263,"I've never had a 'sticky bra' like this before, and wasn't sure what to expect.",79263,4
79263,"Here's what I experienced:

The pros:
It really does make me look like I have some cleavage.",79263,4
79263,"As a very flat-chested woman, that's a huge plus (and why I bought it to begin with).",79263,4
79263,I can actually BUY a backless dress now or one of those cute 'cut-out' dresses!,79263,4
79263,Not nearly as uncomfortable as I expected it to be.,79263,4
79263,I have a feeling that peeling this off at the end of the day is going to be much more relieving than unclasping a bra at the end of the day.,79263,4
79263,It holds really well.,79263,4
79263,"I haven't been in an environment where I sweat a lot (others have said the adhesive doesn't hold when you sweat), but I've been carrying around boxes and stuff today and it's stayed fine.",79263,4
79263,"The cons:
I was kind of hoping for more 'upwards' support with this bra, but because you have to position your boobs to make sure the inside nipple covers do what they're supposed to do (otherwise ouch!",79263,4
79263,"), it's more of a 'together' support instead of 'up' support.",79263,4
79263,Which works out fine!,79263,4
79263,It just would have been nice to have some 'up' support.,79263,4
79263,It's a little bit itchy.,79263,4
79263,"It took some getting used to, and for the most part the itch went away after a little while.",79263,4
79263,But occasionally I do feel a little itchy along the edges.,79263,4
79263,"For the price, this is great just to have as a bra that you can wear with a backless/strapless dress.",79263,4
79263,"Plus, it does give you a bit of a cleavage look, so go ahead and feel sexy!",79263,4
79263,I really enjoy this product so far.,79263,4
79264,These are perfect for people who have narrow slender feet AND slim ankles.,79264,4
79264,"After zipping them up, the bootie is a perfectly snug fit.",79264,4
79264,"If you are into a sleek look, wear them with black pants -- the effect is that you can't tell where your pant ends and the bootie begins.",79264,4
79265,"Very nice looking socks HOWEVER, They run VERY SMALL.....Did not fit a size 13 foot .",79265,4
79265,"But, I gave them to the kids and they love them.",79265,4
79266,I purchased the S in black.,79266,4
79266,It's made of good quality.,79266,4
79266,"The top is TWO pieces, it fits a bit weird, the back closure is a little loose, but it's still cute.",79266,4
79266,The bottom fits me perfectly.,79266,4
79266,I wanted the VS wrap halter that's similar to this one but didn't want to spend $50.,79266,4
79266,I'm happy with this one.,79266,4
79267,Love the reverse belly button rings.,79267,4
79267,"This one is a little small, but very cute!",79267,4
79268,I ordered this shirt in a medium though I typically wear small.,79268,4
79268,It's a bit snug but it still looks great.,79268,4
79268,The material is like a satine which I wasn't expecting but it's very soft and flattering.,79268,4
79269,I was wary of these because of all the reviews about the elastic flipping.,79269,4
79269,"That has happened on at least one of ours, but it doesn't really affect their function or fit too badly.",79269,4
79269,The height difference between these and the same size in Hanna Andersson undies is extreme.,79269,4
79269,The Hanna's rise is at least an inch higher.,79269,4
79269,"My son has quite the pot belly, so I actually tend to reach for these undies more often than his Hanna's that reach up too high and pinch his belly.",79269,4
79269,"My only complaint with the Burt's is that the leg holes are too big and don't have good elastic, so they don't expand and contract easily to get over chunky thighs but then also keep all their bits in after.",79269,4
79269,I wish they'd put better elastic in the leg holes and fix the elastic flipping problem in the waist.,79269,4
79269,Then these would be excellent underwear!,79269,4
79269,(The photo included is a comparison of 2T-3T Burt's Bees vs the same size in Hanna Andersson),79269,4
79270,"Good quality, especially for the price.",79270,4
79270,"I don't know about larger areas, but in my town, it's really difficult to find an inexpensive, everyday belt just to hold up your pants.",79270,4
79270,I just wanted a belt to use for work (factory job).,79270,4
79270,"I didn't want anything fashionable, just utilitarian.",79270,4
79270,"Pay attention to the sizing, though, as the smaller (Medium) size seems to be the default choice when ordering.",79270,4
79270,"I have a 32"" waist, but I prefer the longer (Large) belt.",79270,4
79270,"I have one of each, and the Medium leaves just enough end to make it through the holder loop.",79270,4
79271,This was a gift for Christmas and she love it,79271,4
79273,"the pajamas are cute, good quality and my 6-year old son really likes them.",79273,4
79274,Bought this for a male friend who is spending time in the hospital.,79274,4
79274,Even though it says 'girls' I thought the color was very gender neutral and when it arrived it seemed there was no reason why it wouldn't fit an adult male.,79274,4
79274,"The material is INCREDIBLY soft and the color is pretty close to the photo, maybe slightly darker, a nice neutral taupe.",79274,4
79275,Fits a little small for the price.,79275,4
79275,Other hoodies I've bought in similar size fit a lot bigger.,79275,4
79275,Other than that the material is of a good soft durable quality and it's just like and adult hoodie but tiny.,79275,4
79276,I ordered this for my Lara Croft Halloween costume.,79276,4
79276,"Shipping said it could take two to three weeks but it arrived in like, four days.",79276,4
79276,"Problem was, they gave me two of the same holsters, instead of one right and one left!",79276,4
79276,I emailed the seller and they responded very quickly and got the replacement shipped out.,79276,4
79276,Then I tried the thing on and realized I'd TOLD HER THE WRONG ONE.,79276,4
79276,"So I sent another email, so sorry, I actually need a LEFT one - and without any questions she sent another replacement part.",79276,4
79276,"I offered to ship the one she sent before back, but she didn't mind.",79276,4
79276,And all of this in time for Halloween!,79276,4
79276,"Holy customer service, Batman!",79276,4
79276,Now the quality - the reproduction is good but the material is SERIOUSLY stiff.,79276,4
79276,"I recommend wetting it down with alcohol and spending 30 min twisting, scrunching, kneading etc.",79276,4
79276,to make it move with you when you wear it.,79276,4
79276,"Also, make sure to stretch the holsters width-wise so you can pull your ""guns"" out quickly and actually get them back in without looking.",79276,4
79276,Sells the costume much better.,79276,4
79276,"Lastly, the buckle was too shiny for my taste, so I sanded it a bit and dotted in some grey paint with a sponge to make it look more worn.",79276,4
79276,"One note on sizing - I'm tiny (5'2"") and 115lbs.",79276,4
79276,"The distance from belt to thigh wasn't bad, and the belt wasn't too long for me, but the straps around the thighs were almost too small for me!",79276,4
79276,"And I'm, like I said, TINY.",79276,4
79276,So you may need to size up.,79276,4
79276,"Overall, turned out great.",79276,4
79276,Even won my office costume contest!,79276,4
79277,Wish it came in XS.,79277,4
79278,Got for a Holiday party and received many compliments.,79278,4
79278,Had to wear with thick stockings because it is MUCH shorter than expected which is only reason for 4 stars,79278,4
79279,"When breaking them in, they did cut the back of my feet.",79279,4
79279,"After the initial breaking-in, they were fine.",79279,4
79279,"Looks great, very pleased with the purchase.",79279,4
79280,This was so beautiful!!,79280,4
79280,It wrapped around the baby snuggly and comfortably.,79280,4
79280,"It's thin and sort of delicate, so one should be very careful with handling it, it can pull apart easily and make holes if not careful.",79280,4
79281,This wallet definitly serves it's purpose.,79281,4
79281,I expected it to be slighlty smaller.,79281,4
79281,"For the price, it is a good product.",79281,4
79282,The watches are a real bargain but the picture has them looking more flat than they actually are.,79282,4
79282,They do still have the same thick watch look.,79282,4
79282,Otherwise they are more masculine than they appear in the photos but overall a good buy.,79282,4
79282,Can't complain about how well they work.,79282,4
79283,the balls come of the ring easily,79283,4
79286,These are very comfortable and well-made.,79286,4
79286,They do tend to run a little small so order a size larger and pay attention to sizing,79286,4
79287,I really like this ring set.,79287,4
79287,I only wear the center ring.,79287,4
79287,The other two rings are just too much for me.,79287,4
79287,"The ring band is thicker than I expected, but doesn't bother me much.",79287,4
79287,"The center stone on my ring is a little loose, but it seem like it is going to fall off anytime soon.",79287,4
79287,I am going to super glue it just in case.,79287,4
79287,"I wear the ring all of the time and only take it off to exercise, wash, or swim.",79287,4
79288,I would describe the yellow as more gold.,79288,4
79289,Nice top for the office,79289,4
79290,Feels weird wearing off the shoulders again.,79290,4
79290,It's been a long time.,79290,4
79291,"Fits great, looks great and washes great.",79291,4
79292,This headband fits well in a stretchy snug way that doesn't feel too tight.,79292,4
79292,"I think it looks quite nice, and the only reasons I gave it 4 stars is because #1: It is double thick which I wasn't expecting, and #2: It was wider than I expected.",79292,4
79292,"Overall, nice headband but different that I thought it would be.",79292,4
79293,"This is a really nice dress, but unfortunately I have to return it.",79293,4
79293,It's just too small for me.,79293,4
79293,"It's really cute, and seems really well made.",79293,4
79293,"I had a feeling when I was ordering that the XL would be too small, but it looked so cute that I took a chance.",79293,4
79293,"If it came in a bigger size, I would be ordering it again in a minute.",79293,4
79293,I gave it 4 stars because I simply liked it that much.,79293,4
79293,"If you can get it in a size that fits you, I would 100% recommend.",79293,4
79294,Cute for the price!,79294,4
79294,May need pasties underneath as it is somewhat see-through.,79294,4
79295,"This is a beautiful sweatshirt hoodie it just doesn't fit,it is like a childs or junior size.",79295,4
79295,"I am not a large women and I got an XL I can't zip the shirt,I am a size 8.",79295,4
79295,Really sad because it's pretty and advertised as women's,79295,4
79296,Had to have it taken in a little but the dress worked out great for my daughters Prom,79296,4
79298,I ordered small and it fits nicely.,79298,4
79298,It's made of polyester material and does not have linings so you'll need to wear a slip underneath.,79298,4
79298,The material is very thin.,79298,4
79298,"Mine is about 3 inches too long (I'm only 5', 105 lbs) so I altered the lenght.",79298,4
79298,"Overall, I'm satisfied with the dress.",79298,4
79299,"Cute top, it is as I expected.",79299,4
79299,I am only giving 4 stars because of how long it is.,79299,4
79299,"I am 5'2"" and it goes to my knees.",79299,4
79299,Looks more like a nightdress than a sexy piece of lingerie.,79299,4
79299,If it went mid-thigh I think it would have been perfect.,79299,4
79300,Little to small on the edges,79300,4
79301,Cute necklace--nice for summer.,79301,4
79301,"Nice weight, but a little on the heavy side.",79301,4
79301,Looks as shown in the pictures.,79301,4
79301,Chain is a brassy gold color.,79301,4
79302,"I have small wrists, so it was a bit large on me.",79302,4
79302,Not to the point where it slips off though!,79302,4
79303,Really like the shirt and material.,79303,4
79303,I bought to wear under sweaters.,79303,4
79303,I have found that most crew neck t-shirts for women actually have a slight scoop in the neck.,79303,4
79303,I like a true crew neck.,79303,4
79303,I ended buying men's but the material choices are limited.,79303,4
79303,"This is a true crew neck, hugging the neck with no scoop!",79303,4
79303,I bought an XL.,79303,4
79303,"I'm 5'4"" and 145lbs.",79303,4
79303,I bought the XL for the chest measurements.,79303,4
79303,I have a wide back.,79303,4
79303,"So with this XL fits nicely at the top..  Only issue is it's really long, coming down my entire butt.",79303,4
79303,The price is right so I'm good with it.,79303,4
79303,"If I knew how to hem I would fix the length for me, though.",79303,4
79304,A nice thick material.,79304,4
79304,Better for Fall or Winter.,79304,4
79305,This shirt is very soft and comfortable.,79305,4
79305,I ordered it in size medium according to reviews it was quite fitted (which is accurate).,79305,4
79305,I am a petite 5'2'' and the women's size medium shirt fits snug.,79305,4
79305,I recommend ordering two sizes up for anyone who prefers a more relaxed fit or possibly try the unisex sizes.,79305,4
79307,Very classy & flattering dress.,79307,4
79307,It was a little small but ordered the 2 for my stick thin 14 year old daughter & it worked.,79307,4
79308,Arms are too short,79308,4
79309,Just what I expected.,79309,4
79310,I can't wait to wear it.,79310,4
79311,It's a good product and helps keep your posture along with exersising a decent pressure on the whole abdomen.,79311,4
79312,These pants just came a little to small.,79312,4
79312,"Not way small just a little, so I recommend getting a size larger than your normal size.",79312,4
79312,Other wise these pants are adorable!,79312,4
79312,And at the right price!,79312,4
79313,"I really love this cami, the reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is probably not the fault of the seller.",79313,4
79313,"See, I bought a large instead of a medium to make sure it would not be too small and, of course, it ended up being too long.",79313,4
79313,"And I am 5'8"", so don't be afraid to order conservatively on the size.",79313,4
79313,It really is a nice cami!,79313,4
79315,This is a cute costume .,79315,4
79315,I ordered it for my daughter in a Medium because that's all they had.,79315,4
79315,She is an extra small and the skirt was just a little bit too big .,79315,4
79315,"The top was odd , it's stretchy and that causes the buttons to pull even when it's too small.",79315,4
79315,If you can sew or use iron on stitching that would fix it easily,79315,4
79316,"Perfect size, style and color.",79316,4
79316,Exactly what I was looking for but I wish there were more or bigger inside pockets.,79316,4
79317,I bought this dress in the spring in black.,79317,4
79317,Loved it so much I just got it in olive too.,79317,4
79317,The only downside is the fabric is a little thin so I prefer to wear a slip under it.,79317,4
79317,"I'm 5"" tall and 125lbs, 34D.",79317,4
79317,A small fits me perfectly.,79317,4
79317,Because I'm short it reaches just above my knees which is perfect because I can wear it to work too.,79317,4
79317,"Perfect piko style dress to pair with boots, leggings and scarves without the piko price tag.",79317,4
79319,Fits as expected but is a little short in the back of you are long wasted like I am but buying a bigger size wouldn't help with this issue.,79319,4
79320,See if will last,79320,4
79321,This is the second Amerimark clothing I have bought.,79321,4
79321,So this time it was as expected.,79321,4
79321,"The short is a bit big for me, and the pants are the right size but way too long (i am petit height).",79321,4
79321,"But that was exactly what I expected from this company, and pretty easy to hem.",79321,4
79321,"The fabric is thinner than it looks, so it's better as a fall/spring (low 40s) outfit and not so much for deep winter .",79321,4
79321,The Brocade shirt is lovely.,79321,4
79321,I look forward to taking this with me to Europ.,79321,4
79321,The thinner fabric actually makes it fit well in my suitcase.,79321,4
79322,"After a year, this wallet still looks very nice.",79322,4
79322,"The leather was worn down and smoothed out, and it's also become much darker, so it looks like a different wallet, but still looks nice.",79322,4
79322,"The only failure I've noticed is that the right card pockets seam has come loose, so they now poke out into the middle of the wallet, but it doesn't really affect use.",79322,4
79323,These work well for the price.,79323,4
79323,We go through tons of gloves during the winter so buying in bulk is a must.,79323,4
79323,They fit my petite 4 year old with room to spare.,79323,4
79324,Not as pretty in person as some....but cute.,79324,4
79325,Skirt is a bit large but super cute.,79325,4
79325,I managed to tie it to fit.,79325,4
79325,Decent quality for the price as well!,79325,4
79326,"You can see through the shirt and get a good view of any colorful undergarments, but since I purchased it to wear under scrubs/ uniform it doesn't matter to me.",79326,4
79326,It's comfortable and I can push up the sleeves when needed.,79326,4
79326,The overall size fit as expected.,79326,4
79326,The only problem I had with these was that it isn't a true crew neck like it is shown in the picture.,79326,4
79326,The neckline is a quite a bit lower an wider (style is between crew and scoop).,79326,4
79326,"Unlike crew neck, cross bra straps are not covered with this top.",79326,4
79327,Super cute and perfect for gifting!,79327,4
79328,This hat was a little big on my head height wise but i still wear it.,79328,4
79328,isn't worn out yet!,79328,4
79329,"Fits just fine, not too long, not too short, just as expected.",79329,4
79330,Top was a little small when putting over the head.,79330,4
79330,Other than that it was very nice.,79330,4
79331,"Love this shirt, more importantly my husband LOVES it!",79331,4
79331,"One word of  caution, even after 2 washes the shirt left black dye marks on my white bed sheets.",79331,4
79331,"I would like to order different colors, but am a bit afraid of ruining more sheets",79331,4
79332,I was very happy that the shirt fit perfectly and went great with my mustard color yellow skirt.,79332,4
79332,Together with a pair of black Steve Madden pumps.,79332,4
79332,My outfit was a hit!,79332,4
79333,short in the waist but cute,79333,4
79335,The jacket is very nice looking but unfortunately too small for me.,79335,4
79335,I ordered it mostly to see how it would fit me since I barely have any time to go out shopping and I don't really know much about jacket sizing and unfortunately it turned out to be too small for me but I gifted it to my father because it fit him perfectly.,79335,4
79335,My search for a jacket continues but at least my dad is happy!,79335,4
79336,"I ordered extra large after looking at US sizing and still a little too snug...however I love the stretchy material...it will work considering I ordered it for more workout gear...im sure it will fit nicely after a month in the gym...I'm giving a 4 star rating because it is they type of garnet and material I was looking for, however there extra large was a little too snug...",79336,4
79337,This item was a pleasant surprise- it seems to actually match the product description of how it fits; which is the most important thing in clothing.,79337,4
79337,Very comfortable- I also hope it's durable unlike most clothes sold in recent years but it fits well- not too tight and not too loose depending on your body type.,79337,4
79338,This bikini is very sexy!,79338,4
79338,I was excited to try it on.,79338,4
79338,"However, i ordered a small and I received medium.",79338,4
79338,"The top was very big at first but then after adjusting the straps to the shortest, it fit.",79338,4
79338,The panty however fits just right n some would probably say a bit tight.,79338,4
79338,I would definitely go a size up from the usual...  Where the top can be adjusted the bottom cannot.,79338,4
79339,Very cute shoes but too big size.,79339,4
79339,"My daughter liked it so much that we returned first pair and ordered another one, smaller size.",79339,4
79340,Good as a cheap tank.,79340,4
79340,But the lace does not last very long.,79340,4
79340,I keep buying these however solely because of the price and the fact I don't want to spend more money on another brand without knowing how long they last.,79340,4
79341,Very cute suit but the bra cups are pointy which is not flattering.,79341,4
79342,Very nice shirts and quality.,79342,4
79342,I had to re-order a size larger as the Medium is more like a Small.,79342,4
79343,I am a 36D and this bra did what I expected it to.,79343,4
79343,It doesn't offer a lot of support but us cute under a low back dress or shirt.,79343,4
79343,I wouldn't get if you need lift or a lot of support.,79343,4
79344,"Much thinner than we'd prefer, but for the price it is just fine.",79344,4

79345,"First off, I absolutely love the pants.",79345,4

79345,"At 5'4, 175, it's tough for me to find pants that fit correctly.",79345,4
79345,"I bought the mediums originally, and they were way too long.",79345,4
79345,"Since these have zippers, hemming was less than desirable.",79345,4
79345,Returned them very easily and got the smalls.,79345,4
79345,The small fit me perfectly.,79345,4
79345,"I can't speak to them being water resistant, as I haven't had them wet.",79345,4
79345,"All I can say is they're great for wearing on a quick grocery run, on my way to the gym, or just lounging at home.",79345,4
79347,"Now that I got it, I wish I would have bought it in black, don't really like the reddish color.",79347,4

79348,"Not the highest quality item, but I will keep it and wear it with a pair of leggings.",79348,4
79350,"I like this product, it is fun and edgy.",79350,4

79351,Good quality shirt and production.,79351,4
79352,Very sturdy and cute umbrella.,79352,4
79352,"When arrived however, it was covered in a fine dust that meant I had to wash it all over before I could gift it.",79352,4
79354,"Love this suit, it was just WAY too small and had to send it back!",79354,4
79354,"I'm a 34DD, 27, 34 and normally wear a small or size 3.",79354,4

79367,"Too cute, but a little too tight.",79367,4

79371,I love pajama jeans because they are so soft and comfortable.,79371,4
79371,These fit as expected but the material is a bit stiff and not as comfortable as the other pairs I have.,79371,4
79372,I ordered a size up like people said but I probably shouldn't have.,79372,4
79372,"I ordered a large and I'm a size M.
I'll just have to tighten them tighter .",79372,4
79372,Otherwise they are fine.,79372,4
79372,The pockets were def deep enough and holds my iPhone 6 plus with no issue .,79372,4
79372,I'm thinking of buying a diff color in size M. I'm a female in case it matters.,79372,4
79373,Needs to be prime shipping.,79373,4

79382,I also like that the hood can come off.,79382,4
79383,"Great hat, but went with the XXL when I should've gone XXXL.",79383,4
79384,My husband loved them!,79384,4
79384,But they are a but snug.,79384,4
79385,"It doesn't really stretch very well around the body, and I should have gotten it a size up, but once I lose some more weight the size won't be a problem anymore.",79385,4
79385,But it's super soft and really comfortable!,79385,4
79386,Overall it's good but sometime it ....between both...,79386,4
79387,The fabric is a little lighter weight than expected but I still like it.,79387,4

79388,it is a set of 12 shower curtain hooks.,79388,4
79388,I love the frog portion and the painting on them.,79388,4
79388,I did hope they would be a bit heavier and I was hoing the hooks would be sturdier.,79388,4
79388,They are lightweight and not the quality I was expecting.,79388,4
79388,They do look cute and match the bathroom stuff great.,79388,4
79388,I was just expecting them to be much better.,79388,4
79390,I like it but after one use it tore.,79390,4

79392,Well made and as advertised.,79392,4
79392,Clean and simple lines.,79392,4
79393,Not exactly how the picture shows straps are loose and ya gotta have boobs for this dress,79393,4
79394,I wear this beautifully designed piece with a tank top and leggings; I've had many compliments.,79394,4
79394,The unusual neckline is a delightful change.,79394,4
79394,The fabric is very soft and flowing.,79394,4

79398,Great customer service on the product,79398,4
79399,I wish I could give this 3.5 stars.,79399,4
79399,It's in between okay and I like it.,79399,4
79399,"I do like it, but the fabric is a little rough, maybe if you wash it with fabric softener a couple times that could work?",79399,4
79399,I did enjoy the pack of all of these and you do get more than what is expected for how much you pay for.,79399,4
79399,"Overall, I would say this was a great needed purchase for me.",79399,4
79400,Collar is not as large as image.,79400,4
79400,"Nice quality fabric, thick cotton.",79400,4
79401,I love this blouse.,79401,4
79401,"It is very large and roomy, so like the picture I toss it on over a tank top and jeans.",79401,4
79401,"The model has it slumped off one shoulder, I can tell you that's impossible, the neck is not wide enough.",79401,4
79401,Other then that the picture is accurate to the product and it's exactly as expected.,79401,4
79402,Theres not a whole that they could mess up with a mouse mask.,79402,4
79402,One thing to note is that it is child sized and significantly too small for an adult Australian man's face.,79402,4
79402,The head band that wraps around the face is kinda uncomfortable but not too bad.,79402,4
79403,"Its really comfy, cute with leggings or jeans, and sexy alone as a dress.",79403,4
79403,I ordered Red but got Salmon so I took away a star,79403,4
79404,"Did not expect an authentic lokai, but my daughter wanted to give her friend the camo, and her friend was happy with her gift.",79404,4
79405,Patterns are great but a couple of them are quite small and hard to pull on over my heel/ankle.,79405,4
79405,"Then again I wear a 12, so maybe for smaller feet/ankles they'd work well.",79405,4
79406,"It is a bit short on me (I'm 5'7"" with a shorter torso but a lot of booty that can make it hard to find a dress that fits), but perfect to wear over leggings for work.",79406,4
79406,"The patterns add a beautiful touch to an otherwise simple design that elevates it, and the color is gorgeous.",79406,4
79407,"Nice, cute flannel nightgown.",79407,4
79407,"Sleeves are nice length, as is the bottom.",79407,4
79407,"There is some shrinkage, I purchased a 1X but can usually wear a L.  I would recommend one size up, especially if you want comfy and roomy.",79407,4
79407,"I deducted one star because of the neckline, it is cut way too low.",79407,4
79407,"I have used a safety pin to close it a little, May sew it up some.",79407,4
79407,Unable to lean forward without gaping open revealing all.,79407,4
79408,Runs a little small but very pleased with the purchase.,79408,4
79409,"Pretty much like as all the other reviewers already said, shipping was great, packaging as fine, arrived quickly.",79409,4
79409,It's a cheap but fun costume.,79409,4
79409,"There is nothing printed on the back, the knee pads are off kilter & should just be removed, but...it's Vader!",79409,4
79409,"And if you could be anyone from Star Wars, don't you want to be Vader?",79409,4
79409,"I'm 5'6, fluctuate anywhere from 145 to 150lbs, bought a large & wish I had gotten a medium.",79409,4
79409,It's loose around the waist but nothing that will bother me from wearing it.,79409,4
79409,The cape length reached to the back of my knees.,79409,4
79409,Perhaps the size large capes are a little longer because I read several reviews stating the cape barely went past the backside.,79409,4
79409,"All in all, I am happy with this purchase and will be wearing it for Halloween.",79409,4
79410,It is what I expected.,79410,4
79411,The toe box is much more pointed than the F-lite 235.,79411,4
79411,It fits to the big toe but allows too much space for the other toes.,79411,4
79411,Still fits but would prefer a snug fit!,79411,4
79412,Runs a bit small.,79412,4
79413,Like it a lot except it gets very heavy on the shoulder after all day being out,79413,4
79414,Better quality than I thought!,79414,4
79414,Looks like the images shown.,79414,4
79414,Packaged well and arrived on time.,79414,4
79414,Just smaller than expected.,79414,4
79416,Love the length and fit!!,79416,4
79416,Great to wear with leggings!,79416,4
79417,Very cute just cannot get it on without help.,79417,4
79417,Relieved it fits so nicely!,79417,4
79419,The only thing I would say is it was a lot thinner then expected,79419,4
79420,I bought this for my 6-month old for Halloween.,79420,4
79420,"It's nice for the price, and we made it work, but the waist on the tail was way too large for my chunky baby.",79420,4
79420,"There was a ribbon, but it only tightened it a little.",79420,4
79420,"The weave was also loose, so her toes kept getting stuck through the holes.",79420,4
79420,And the flowers were closer to under the armpits than where they show on the picture.,79420,4
79420,"I don't regret buying it, but it would be better for a younger, less wiggly stage.",79420,4
79421,"It's great, excellent fit!",79421,4
79422,Has a seam down the back and the belt is not so great.,79422,4
79422,"But, the dress itself is great.",79422,4
79423,These earrings are a very pretty dark blue/green zircon.,79423,4
79423,"The gold is a snake which is not my usual style, but unless you look closely, it just looks like pretty gold.",79423,4
79423,They are not too heavy and very pretty.,79423,4
79424,I'm probably a little smaller than their normal market so they bunch just a little at the knees but I love the fit!,79424,4
79425,I ordered this jacket for my daughter.,79425,4
79425,"I was worried the large would be too big considering it's a women's jacket, but she is thin, tall, and has long arms.",79425,4
79425,Needless to say it fits her really good!,79425,4
79425,She looks amazing in this jacket.,79425,4
79425,I'm so glad I checked here on Amazon because in the department stores this jacket is over $50,79425,4
79426,"I took medium size, but it is too tight for me...",79426,4
79426,So may be large wud have been correct ..,79426,4
79426,But the dress was good n nice.,79426,4
79427,Bought a size 8 for my daughter.,79427,4
79428,Great color just the right size,79428,4
79432,"Like always, even though I ordered a XL size, they do not cover DD boobs.",79432,4
79432,But it looks fantastic and worked great for my rouge cosplay,79432,4
79433,"I'm sure it's supposed to be off-white, but it looks almost yellow.",79433,4
79433,Okay for the price.,79433,4
79434,"I like it, but my son refuse to wear it.",79434,4
79434,Hope he will change his mind one day,79434,4
79437,It fit just as expected and was a good item.,79437,4
79437,I'm 5'9 130lbs and the medium fit me perfectly.,79437,4
79437,"I ended up returning it though because I don't like the feel of rayon, but otherwise it was a good product.",79437,4
79437,Seller was quick with the refund.,79437,4
79438,I ordered this for my daughter to wear for here 4th birthday.,79438,4
79438,"She is usually wears a 3t, but I ordered a 4t knowing I could take it in if needed.",79438,4
79438,"The shirt was plenty long and fit exactly as I expected (actually a little big on her), however the pants/leggings were very snug.",79438,4
79438,"They are definitely a carpi length and not full pants, which was fine for us, however the waist band seemed was uncomfortably tight.",79438,4
79438,She didn't seem to mind when trying it on so hopefully it will not bother her.,79438,4
79438,I would definitely suggest sizing up.,79438,4
79438,"As far as quality, I have no complaints.",79438,4
79438,"This was an inexpensive outfit, made in China, so it could have seemed very cheap.",79438,4
79438,Outwardly I have no issues.,79438,4
79438,"There were a few stings inside I may need to trim and I don't know how well it will hold up to washing, but for one day I'm sure it will be fine.",79438,4
79439,Very comfortable with stretch,79439,4
79440,"Great looking, decent material.",79440,4
79440,Goes very nicely with the shirt I had in mind.,79440,4
79441,This was a present for my mother.,79441,4
79441,She loves it and wears it often!,79441,4
79441,"The fabric is very soft and washes well, does need ironing.",79441,4
79441,The fabric is a bit thin but that is nice in the summer as she does not care for shorts.,79441,4
79442,I love this jewelry but it was way bigger than i expected... :/,79442,4
79443,the only drawback is the band at the end of the legs are not that tight.,79443,4
79444,It's a cute & comfortable dress.,79444,4
79444,"I got the pink one & my only complaint is that it's a little bit see through, so I would recommend wearing light colored bra/underwear with it.",79444,4
79445,Amazing dress good material just a little too short for me tho,79445,4
79447,BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED.,79447,4
79449,If polyester makes your feet sweat then pass otherwise good socks,79449,4
79450,Ran smaller than expected but was still able to use.,79450,4
79450,Very pretty dress over all.,79450,4
79451,if you are tall I advise against this suit!!,79451,4
79451,I feel like this is just not made for taller ladies.,79451,4
79451,"I'm 5'10 157 pounds, I wear a 6/8 bottom and medium top.",79451,4
79451,I read some of the other reviews and ordered up (I purchased an XL when I normally wear a M}.,79451,4
79451,The XL is still ill fitting.,79451,4
79451,Nothing against the product itself!,79451,4
79451,It is very cute.,79451,4
79451,I just advise against buying if you are tall.,79451,4
79453,I received this bracelet today.,79453,4
79453,This is a Christmas present for my 21 year old granddaughter.,79453,4
79453,I am sure she will be pleased..,79453,4
79454,If you aren't 100% confident in your physique this shirt will just hang in your closet.,79454,4
79454,It shows even the smallest of muffin tops.,79454,4
79454,I have a few more workouts before I'll even take mine out to wear.,79454,4
79455,"It was good quality, nice design.",79455,4
79455,Very firm and sturdy look to it.,79455,4

79460,It kept me from getting chilled because of the a.c..,79460,4
79460,Thanks for making a great product!,79460,4
79461,Not completely understanding how the measurements really went the crown was to large.,79461,4
79461,Thankfully a jeweler in town helped us out by curving it the best he could without breaking it.,79461,4
79461,"It was a nice quality, but it was a little heavy.",79461,4
79461,"The pins which came with it would not fit well in the holes, but we made it work anyway.",79461,4
79462,"Fast deliver., daughter happy with it.",79462,4
79463,it fit everywhere expect on my thighs it was a little tight but They're cute I can do little adjustments lol.,79463,4
79464,"Love the hoodie, fits great and looks good too.",79464,4
79464,Wish they said that the breast pocket and the arm pocket were fake and you can't put anything in them though.,79464,4
79464,"Other than that, I've got a bunch of compliments about it.",79464,4
79465,"Very tight, but it's meant to be and it does look like what the model is wearing.",79465,4

79471,"only size not correspond to the ordered, and fabric very cheap",79471,4
79472,The 6-12 month size fits like a 2T.,79472,4
79472,I'm glad I ordered the smaller size.,79472,4
79473,I thing it's cute for the price point ... Good color of red looks a little dressy but you can wear with jeans and dress up your outfit.,79473,4
79475,I had been looking for a scarf for the spring and was so happy I found this one on Amazon.,79475,4
79475,My only complaint is that the picture isn't representative of the actual colors.,79475,4
79475,The flamingos are more coral and the background is closer to off white than white.,79475,4
79475,"Other than it not being the exact colors I anticipated, it is a nice looking scarf.",79475,4
79477,"light weight you forget you have it on,
very durable and chic",79477,4
79478,Good product as described,79478,4
79479,"It's still a little early to tell how long this suit will last, only wore it once.",79479,4
79479,"Nice fit, I do suggest getting a tad larger since it's difficult to get on with the backing which is why I am concerned how long it will last with me having to stretch it out so often just to get it on.",79479,4
79479,Nice fit though and very comfy great for swimmers like me,79479,4
79480,"Pretty, but super thin.",79480,4
79480,For the price it was good enough,79480,4
79481,Satisfied with the name badge.,79481,4
79481,Probably could've made one myself a little bit better looking and better quality.,79481,4
79481,"It's a bit on the thin side, but it'll work!",79481,4
79482,"The only reason I gave 4 stars is that though my 9 year old isn't rough on shoes and these should last him, I think a tougher more rough and tumble kid may wear these out quicker than expected.",79482,4
79482,For us they're fine.,79482,4
79483,The dress was pretty big but I wore it with several long necklaces and felt that it added the perfect touch.,79483,4
79484,"They fit my family's traveling needs, 2 adults & 3 kids.",79484,4
79484,"I used zip ties to attach to the luggage, not the cheap plastic thing that was provided.",79484,4
79484,No big deal to me though.,79484,4
79484,I wrote our contact info on tags and used clear packing tape over the written info and slid the paper cardboard back into the yellow holder.,79484,4
79484,The tags made it all the way across the country and back with no issues.,79484,4
79486,Like the shirt but the fabric is not as soft as it could be.,79486,4
79487,Somewhat small but it fits... this crop top is so damn cute!,79487,4
79487,Just get a size up your regular size if you don't like tight.,79487,4
79487,Its not too tight but tight because it's sort of a silky material.,79487,4
79488,This bag is a bit smaller than expected however I am happy with my purchase.,79488,4
79488,It fits comfortably on my shoulder and my many everyday items fits nicely inside.,79488,4
79488,It is a beautiful and very durable handbag.,79488,4
79489,My husband instantly fell in love,79489,4
79490,"Even though I gave my measurements, the sleeves are too tight.",79490,4
79490,Otherwise the dress is beautiful.,79490,4
79490,Good value of the money,79490,4
79492,Buy the shirt in the size you normally wear.,79492,4
79492,It is already sized for the chest protector.,79492,4
79492,If you want a tighter fit for the field get a smaller size and have one for plate and one for field.,79492,4
79492,The shirt is of decent quality so far.,79492,4
79494,"210 lbs, 5ft2, 42 DD - this dress fits great!",79494,4
79494,Its on the shorter side but its true to size and very flattering.,79494,4
79495,"This suit is not perfect, but I didn't expect it to be.",79495,4
79495,"It is a little longer the I expected, but I still love it.",79495,4
79495,It does run small so I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits great.,79495,4
79495,The cups that came in it are awkward but they came right out.,79495,4
79495,"If you are looking for a high end perfect suit don't order this, but if you are looking for a cheap comfortable and cute suit this is perfect.",79495,4
79496,Runs a littlebit small,79496,4
79498,"Warm, comfortable, good quality.",79498,4
79498,Size runs somewhat large.,79498,4
79500,"You get what you pay for, perfect for my ten year old, not super high quality but great price.",79500,4
79501,love it so nice and came in its time thanks amazon,79501,4
79502,Cute but fits a little small,79502,4
79503,"Super cute, but way too small.",79503,4
79504,"This is a cute, flattering dress - sized as expected - BUT mine arrived as a V-neck, which is not very flattering on me.",79504,4
79504,The pictures all show the dress with a scoop neck.,79504,4
79504,I'm still deciding whether to send it back but I'm not confident that re-ordering would bring a different result.,79504,4
79504,"UPDATE: I sent the dress back per the instructions given, with the label I was sent.",79504,4
79504,They were to deduct some of the price of the dress to pay for return shipping.,79504,4
79504,"It's been TEN MONTHS since I sent it back, and it just showed up in the mail today labeled ""return to sender.""",79504,4
79504,You can no longer buy the dress and I don't know if the company even exists anymore.,79504,4
79504,"Either way, I'm super annoyed they sent me the wrong item and it was gone for ten months before they even rejected my return.",79504,4
79507,This is a nice Michael Kor but the leather is pretty hard.,79507,4
79507,I got the same bag (navy blue) from Belk and the leather was much softer.,79507,4
79507,The price was better on Amazon.,79507,4
79508,"Legs are a bit large to the bottom, but I will adjust to my liking.",79508,4
79509,Fits exactly as expected.,79509,4
79509,Does the trick for the occasion.,79509,4
79510,Very sheer and fit is smaller than expected.,79510,4
79510,Still like the dress though.,79510,4
79510,Doesn't fit as shown in photo though.,79510,4
79510,Size up if you want to loose boho look.,79510,4
79513,wife liked it and I did too.,79513,4
79514,Very nice and heavy duty belt.,79514,4
79516,Was a little tight glad i ordered a size up!,79516,4
79517,Thought I was getting rings from Forever 21.,79517,4
79517,The rings look similar but they weren't in original packaging.,79517,4
79517,They we're in a baggie.,79517,4
79517,Still nice rings though!,79517,4
79518,not made for B cups,79518,4
79519,"I ordered a size 6 and normally wear 6.5 to a 7, so these run large.",79519,4
79519,I got nervous about the Velcro not sticking well at first but all is working fine now.,79519,4
79519,I like the ability to adjust so many straps as I have narrow feet and as a teacher I appreciate the comfort of these.,79519,4
79520,Cutie and simple good for work or day out.,79520,4
79520,"The color is more on the light green, think green apple.",79520,4
79520,The fit runs a bit big i ordered the xsmall which at times is a hit or miss depending on the brand and this dress unfortunately runs big.,79520,4
79521,These are okay beads.,79521,4
79521,We purchased them for our photobooth and they are fine for that.,79521,4
79521,They look and feel a little plasticy but that's okay for our purpose.,79521,4
79522,thought it would be a little warmer,79522,4
79523,"Could be a bit softer, but my son loves is Dino robe.",79523,4
79523,Great price especially since it includes slippers.,79523,4
79525,Ordered a size up just to be on the safe side and it's perfect!,79525,4
79525,Very soft and warm.,79525,4
79525,Well worth the fifty bucks,79525,4
79526,"not the most insulated, but helps with staying warm while doing winter activities.",79526,4
79527,This product really helps with support after giving birth.,79527,4
79527,It also helps to smooth and flatten the appearance of your stomach.,79527,4
79527,I'm not sure about long term results because I've only been wearing for about 1.5 weeks.,79527,4
79527,My only complaint is the fact that you can see the place where the Velcro crosses over in the front which you can then see underneath clothes.,79527,4
79529,Fits nice and slim.,79529,4
79530,Somewhat small for my 38 inch waste.,79530,4
79530,My wife like the way I look in them.,79530,4
79531,Bought for my boyfriend and they were too narrow.,79531,4
79531,Bought wide width leather ones instead.,79531,4
79532,Little tight in arms high neck line,79532,4
79533,"Overall, a good fit although I would have liked a bit more tummy control in the mesh lining.",79533,4
79533,"Also, I wish the straps were adjustable as I would like a little more support in the bust area.",79533,4
79533,It's definitely flattering and I like the chlorine resistant nature of the material.,79533,4
79534,my son loves them,79534,4
79535,"I Ordered this shirt on May 16 and recevened it today, May 27.",79535,4
79535,A week earlier that what it said it was going to be.,79535,4
79535,It was packaged very nicely thing wrong with it that I could see right away.,79535,4
79535,"(did not include pictures, sorry) After taking out of the package I could see that there are printing errors that carry on to the white part of the shirt.",79535,4
79535,The black part of the shirt is a little stiff but I'm sure that it will soften up with wear and washing.,79535,4
79535,"I'm a 5'5""1/2 in hight and 136 in weight 34-36B in bra size, and after reading the reviews I decided that an 1x large would be perfict, I have receved a 2x large.",79535,4
79535,It fits as a large shirt would fit in American sizing.,79535,4
79535,"The shipping information does say that my order has not arrived yet, I don't know what the means.",79535,4
79535,Also I forgot to right it apove but the shirt does smell like new shoes.,79535,4
79535,Over all I will be keeping the shirt for I like it.,79535,4
79535,But a 1x large would of been the perfict size for me.,79535,4
79535,(I'm wearing spandex underneath the shirt in the photos).,79535,4
79536,Omg it actually fit!,79536,4
79536,The reviews had me skeptical because everyone was saying it was unusually large but I happen to have thick legs so good for me.,79536,4
79537,Item fit as expected.,79537,4
79538,"Great watch
It is however shipped with no instructions for the operation of
the watch.",79538,4
79538,"Need this for Bezel info and setting of separate dials
Without it the functions are useless and I would have no choice
but to return the watch to Amazon

79539,I also love the bright summery color- and have gotten many compliments.,79539,4
79539,"They are comfortable, fashionable, and healthy for my feet.",79539,4
79541,just like the one the army gave me.,79541,4
79542,The colors are great not to transparent which you get with a lot of the silicone.,79542,4
79542,"The only issue I have is that they are a bit wide, they don't stick out of my ears a lot but the do slightly which really isn't an issue for me I don't mind it but for someone with thinner earlobes it might be an issue but I'm sure you could cut them to size.",79542,4
79542,Asside from that I am very happy with my purchase!,79542,4
79543,Goes nicely with my new Guess purse!,79543,4
79543,"Should have gotten a bigger
Wallet though",79543,4
79544,My son loved them he is so excited to wear for his birthday!!!!,79544,4
79545,Loved the fabric and color but expected it to be larger.,79545,4
79546,Materials are a little tacky but looks good :) I enjoyed wearing it for sure,79546,4
79547,Fit as expected bc I went up a size.,79547,4
79547,Very pretty and unique.,79547,4
79548,These are great for the price.,79548,4
79548,They are very stretchy and soft.,79548,4
79548,"However, they have a pretty big waist and they tent to slide off of me really easy, plus the are weirdly large in the crotch area.",79548,4
79548,They also break down faster then my more expensive jeans.,79548,4
79549,Purchased for spousal unit.,79549,4
79549,She hasn't complained which is always a good sign.,79549,4
79549,"Of course, just as it arrived our weather took a warm turn and she may not have a need for it the rest of the season.",79549,4
79549,"Nonetheless, after trying it on, and it fit fine - just a bit snug - she said it was good for the cold.",79549,4
79550,I'm looking forward to wear for Halloween!,79550,4
79550,Top is a little short.,79550,4
79550,Kind of top bra.,79550,4
79550,but it looks okay to me.,79550,4
79550,bottom is okay as well.,79550,4
79550,my size is xxs size.,79550,4
79550,so I can adjust them.,79550,4
79551,I was hoping for the one pictured but I got the nude with black piping this is not pictured on the website.,79551,4
79551,I don't really want to go through the return process so I am going to keep it because it still looks like a nice bag.,79551,4
79551,I will update with pictures later.,79551,4
79552,It fit as expected,79552,4
79553,I will buy more,79553,4
79555,They have a packaging smell but it came out after 1st wash.,79555,4
79555,They fit as expected and I love the thickness of the fabric.,79555,4
79555,I expected panty hose quality but they are a little thicker than that.,79555,4
79555,I'm hoping they will hold up for a while.,79555,4
79557,Nice long shirt I like the lace on the sides and the sleeve length.,79557,4
79557,"It is comfortable, stretchy and doesn't appear to get big wrinkles easily which is nice when in a hurry.",79557,4
79558,They're amazing and look like the picture to a tee.,79558,4
79558,The only problem I have with them is that my nose is very skinny and the glasses slide down making me look like a hippe.,79558,4
79559,Love this dress but had to return.,79559,4
79559,"I am a large, I ordered a XL based upon the reviews but a 2X would have been a perfect fit as the size is way off.",79559,4
79559,So order up 2 sizes if you want a good fit.,79559,4
79560,Sent earlier as promised.,79560,4
79560,It pants fits tighter than expected.,79560,4
79561,Bought them for my 11 year old step daughter.,79561,4
79561,I do wish the bracelets were a little easier to get on and off.,79561,4
79562,Same as in the photo and the material feels nice on my skin - not too harsh.,79562,4
79562,Wish it had longer ones.,79562,4
79563,I really like this purse.,79563,4
79563,"I don't come across many cross body bags that are the right combination of good quality, sufficient room, and modest price tag- this leather cross body bag definitely is all three.",79563,4
79563,I like the amount of space this bag has.,79563,4
79563,"It can easily fit a small wallet, a mini notebook, and a small spray perfume bottle-without being cramped.",79563,4
79563,It has an adjustable strap so you can adjust the height of where the bag falls by your waist.,79563,4
79563,"The closure of the flap is a magnetic closure, but also utilizes a zipper, an excellent feature of the bag because it ensures the security of your bag contents.",79563,4
79563,"Overall, great buy !",79563,4
79563,I am very pleased with the product.,79563,4
79566,Love the clip on and the snap for a thumb drive!,79566,4
79567,Super cute but run a bit small.,79567,4
79568,"It was cute, but I ordered a size up, and it was still just a tad too small.",79568,4
79568,"I can wear it, and it will zip, but when I do so, it's tighter than I would like.",79568,4
79569,nice hat for the price,79569,4
79570,My order came fairly quickly.,79570,4
79570,I ordered a medium but it comes pretty large but that's no problem.,79570,4
79570,"It is much longer than it shows, one reason I ordered a medium.",79570,4
79570,It is pretty sheer and the lining is of costume quality but it works because it doesn't show.,79570,4
79570,Overall its a good buy!,79570,4
79571,The blouse is nice.,79571,4
79572,Nice quality and heavy duty.,79572,4
79572,However it runs small.,79572,4
79572,Cold water and hang dry only!,79572,4
79573,"Prompt delivery, no damage, cubes functioned usefully as advertised.",79573,4
79574,It was a bit smaller than I originally thought.,79574,4
79574,It came with a strong chemical smell as does anything that comes from China.,79574,4
79574,I thought this would be a longer infinity scarf that i could wrap around but in reality it is just one really thick piece of fabric in a circle a little bigger than just to fit around your head.,79574,4
79574,I'm not mad about that because it looks just fine when i use it to layer underneath my big scarf but not particularly the most attractive on its own.,79574,4
79574,The color was very true and it's very cozy... just not what I expected.,79574,4
79575,i have to say that im very pleased with my purchase!!!,79575,4
79575,theres so many diffrent ones i was kinda iffy about it at first but it came early and all of them are so cute .,79575,4
79575,im rating it 4 because people got glittery ones nd i didn't haha,79575,4
79576,They are wonderful to look at but they are very heavy and sort of stretch my ear hole.,79576,4
79576,"The stretched ear doesnt look good, but the earring is marvelous.",79576,4
79578,I was very happy when I got this.,79578,4
79578,"It fit great & just beautiful, love this top!",79578,4
79579,I personally would have liked more of a scoop neck.,79579,4
79579,Fits a little big around my mid section but neck/shoulders/chest fit fine.,79579,4
79579,32A chest and 25 inch waist.,79579,4
79579,"Quality is fine, it's not cotton if that's what you're thinking!",79579,4
79580,"Great shoe to slip on and go, which is exactly what I bought them for.",79580,4
79580,"I wouldn't recommend going on hikes with them, but they are comfortable for everyday use around town.",79580,4
79580,A little narrow so those with wide feet should look elsewhere.,79580,4
79581,Love the turquoise face.,79581,4
79582,Very happy with the design.,79582,4
79582,It is also very light and handy.,79582,4
79583,This thermal underwear is warm underneath jeans and a sweater.,79583,4
79583,"I would like it if they were a little heavier, but no other complaints.",79583,4
79584,Just wish the offered different.,79584,4
79585,I really wanted to like this.,79585,4
79585,I ordered based on my size and dimensions.,79585,4
79585,The cups are just too small.,79585,4
79585,Even when the padding is removed.,79585,4
79585,"So, the US Small (Chinese XL) will not work for 34D-34DD size.",79585,4
79586,This dress is beautiful and figure flattering.,79586,4
79586,It does run small I'm an XL and I ordered the 3X and it fit I wish is was a little looser.,79586,4
79586,But it still a beautiful dress.,79586,4
79586,"Even though the dress run really small the size chart in the listing is pretty accurate, so you should order the dress using that.",79586,4
79586,If you are considering buying this dress do it!,79586,4
79586,Specially if you have amazon prime and can benefit from free returns if the dress does not fit.,79586,4
79588,I read reviews that said it ran small.,79588,4
79588,"I usually wear a juniors XS-S and the medium I purchased, was too big both width and length-wise.",79588,4
79588,It was similar to a juniors medium-large.,79588,4
79588,I wish I would have purchased a small.,79588,4
79588,"If you wear juniors sizes, order the size you normally wear in juniors.",79588,4
79588,"If you wear misses sizes, you may want to go up a size.",79588,4
79588,"If you wear men's sizes, you will want to go up two sizes.",79588,4
79588,"As for the quality of this shirt, I ordered the one with Barbie against the rainbow cloud background.",79588,4
79588,The image quality was perfect!,79588,4
79588,"It was not pixelated, faded, or blurry.",79588,4
79588,The one thing that did disappoint me is the quality of the material.,79588,4
79588,It feels like neoprene and has a foul plastic oder.,79588,4
79588,The odor was very strong and I had to air out the shirt outside because I didn't want to wash and dry it with other clothes (the odor was that bad!),79588,4
79588,"The sweatshirt material wasn't very comfortable, I literally felt as if I was wearing a neoprene computer case.",79588,4
79588,"If only, it was made from the cotton-polyester sweatshirt blend (the kind with a soft interior), I would give it 5 stars.",79588,4
79589,Very nice looking vest.,79589,4
79589,"Color looks beige in the picture, but is in fact more olive toned as described.",79589,4
79589,My friend has a 44 in chest.,79589,4
79589,"The size chart states that large is chest size 42-44, but the large was quite small on him.",79589,4
79589,I returned it for an Xlarge and that fits perfectly.,79589,4
79589,"It was a birthday gift, and he loves it.",79589,4
79589,Well worth the money!,79589,4
79590,"Need to go a size up, but comfortable material.",79590,4
79591,I got these in maroon.,79591,4
79591,Super cute for fall and comfortable.,79591,4
79591,I ordered a half size down and they fit perfectly.,79591,4
79591,"My only con was that when I opened the box, there was a very strong chemical smell.",79591,4
79591,I had to open my windows to get rid of it.,79591,4
79592,I absolutely love this dress.,79592,4
79592,It is so cute and comfy.,79592,4
79592,I am a size six and I ordered a large (two sizes up) as others suggested.,79592,4
79592,"My one issue is that it is very low cut, so I plan on sewing a snap into the top to keep anything from showing.",79592,4
79592,I would definitely recommend this dress.,79592,4
79593,These shoes are holding up well to the everyday use of my 5 year old.,79593,4
79593,"He wanted the light-up shoes, which get harder to find after toddler sizes.",79593,4
79593,These were a great find.,79593,4
79594,Just order a bigger size,79594,4
79596,These are some cool shoes.,79596,4
79596,Thanks for making the product right for us.,79596,4
79596,They are working perfectly fine as right now.,79596,4
79597,Wear thick socks ;),79597,4
79598,The jacket fit a little smaller than I expected.,79598,4
79598,You can't really layer it up much but for Los Angeles' weather it's not like you have to layer up much.,79598,4
79598,Overall I really like it,79598,4
79599,I should have sized down for a better fit.,79599,4
79599,Has rows of hooks for adjustment so I didn't need a large :(,79599,4
79600,Little small around the crease on armpit area.,79600,4
79600,I'm 5'2 & 130lb.,79600,4
79600,Saw that it ran a size larger.,79600,4
79600,So ordered a M. But I love it otherwise,79600,4
79601,Shirt arrived on time and was exactly what I expected,79601,4
79602,Definitely a product that you have to have the right body type for.,79602,4
79603,"These are tights, ***not leggings.",79603,4
79603,"***
Great compression, and they really help with swelling.",79603,4
79603,"When I wear them, my legs feel much better.",79603,4
79603,They also stay up over my belly all day without slipping (currently 35 weeks).,79603,4
79603,"Very good quality ***tights***
BUT, I only wear them with dresses.",79603,4
79603,"They work well under dresses, but NOT under long sweaters or tunics or anything else you'd wear with leggings.",79603,4
79603,They are too sheer to wear as leggings.,79603,4
79603,"I was hoping I could wear them with leggings, but nope.",79603,4
79603,Still happy with them because the compression is great and they make my swollen legs feel better.,79603,4
79604,Excellent product for flat feet,79604,4
79605,"It is very form fitting and although it is stretchy, it seems kinda tight around the belly.",79605,4
79605,I wonder how much longer it will fit without looking too thin.,79605,4
79605,"It is a little thin, I have to coordinate my underwear well or it will show through.",79605,4
79606,"Really cute, love the material and the colors",79606,4
79608,It's a tiny bit see through when it's stretched a bit.,79608,4
79608,I was about 158 pounds and measured 36-30-41.,79608,4
79608,Really nice material though!,79608,4
79608,I have also let several friends borrow it and it's fit their different shapes well too.,79608,4
79608,I just wish the material was a little more cotton-like instead of more spandex-like.,79608,4
79608,overall satisfied though and I will be wearing it many times to come I'm sure!,79608,4
79609,Lace part is see through.,79609,4
79609,It was somewhat short but very cute.,79609,4
79610,The size was small for a 6-yeal old girl.,79610,4
79610,Otherwise it was a nice dress at a good price.,79610,4
79613,My husband loves these!,79613,4
79615,These socks look cute on but the material is thick and can be a bit too warm.,79615,4
79615,"They also fit a little tight which can be a little uncomfortable, they left indentations on me.",79615,4
79615,But overall they looked cute for a costume i was wearing.,79615,4
79616,My 3.5 yr old thinks they are cool.,79616,4
79616,They are soft and cute.,79616,4
79616,They do run very small.,79616,4
79616,My son wears a 10 and the 11/12 fit with not much room to grow.,79616,4
79616,"They don't seem to be as slip resistant as some other slippers we've had, but they'll do.",79616,4
79617,"Was quite happy with these shoes, the worse the trail gets the better the shoe performes.",79617,4
79617,The lacing system does not disappoint and allows for a really secure feeling.,79617,4
79617,My only complaint and this is no reflection on the shoe it self is that it runs a bit on the warm side however I live in the Caribbean so can't really blame the shoes.,79617,4
79619,Only tried it on and you can tell immediately the material is very cheap.,79619,4
79619,But so was the bikini.,79619,4
79619,So I still think it was worth to order.,79619,4
79620,Was a gift an my sister loved it!!!,79620,4
79621,love the fabric not see through at all.just to small I had to squeeze into them.,79621,4
79622,"When I saw the blouse, I was concerned that it was too small, but it fit perfectly.",79622,4
79624,beautiful just a tad too small for good size cell phone,79624,4
79625,Purchased for my 3 month old.,79625,4
79625,Perfect fit using the sizer string.,79625,4
79625,"Really lightweight,  great coverage.",79625,4
79625,"Have used it once, looking forward to seeing how well it does with 4 days at the beach.",79625,4
79625,"Love the adjustable head sizer, only wish the neck strap also naff an easy slide adjuster too.",79625,4
79626,The friend I bought it for said it was beautiful but made for a child.,79626,4
79626,It was too small but she kept it anyway.,79626,4
79626,That is my only reason for for the four stars.,79626,4
79626,It should have been noted it would not fit an adult wrist.,79626,4
79627,My son begged for this hoodie and I finally gave in.,79627,4
79627,"The fit of the medium was excellent for my 13 year old son, the design is great and overall quality is pretty good.",79627,4
79627,My only complaint is he caught the pocket on something and all the stitching pulled out the entire top portion of the pocket; luckily I was able to not only fix it but I also reinforced it so hopefully it doesn't happen again.,79627,4
79628,Thought the one line was sparkly but it wasn't.,79628,4
79628,Very durable crossbody bag.,79628,4
79629,I had a short black slip and I had a longer black slip but I needed something in between.,79629,4
79629,This half slip was just the length I needed.,79629,4
79629,It came nicely folded on a hanger in a plastic package.,79629,4
79629,It did have a chemically smell but it came out with the first wash.,79629,4
79629,"The material is a little stiff at first, but I think it will loosen up after a few washes.",79629,4
79629,I'd rather have a slip with some weight than one that is too thin and clingy so that it rides up all the time.,79629,4
79630,Glasses really set off the whoe outfit.,79630,4
79630,So glad I got them.,79630,4
79631,Great shirt for the price.,79631,4
79631,Fits well and looks good on.,79631,4
79631,Construction quality isn't what you would get in a designer shirt but much better than you would expect in an inexpensive shirt.,79631,4
79632,This is the best easy for dress!,79632,4
79632,I have a baby so getting ready for work has to be quick.,79632,4
79632,This dress fits great.,79632,4
79632,"Only hoped it would come with a small black belt, just to complete the outfit.",79632,4
79633,This is a cute hat but it is a bit on the small side.,79633,4
79633,"If meant for a young child it would be perfect, however not a good fit for a teenager.",79633,4
79634,"Beautiful, totally love it",79634,4
79635,So cute and I am confident taking my daughter to the pool that everything will be contained.,79635,4
79635,I also love that it has a bit of absorbing power so that if she pees on the way to the pool I won't get soaked.,79635,4
79635,Only thing I'd change is to make both sides snap so that if she were to poo I wouldn't have to carefully finagle it off her leg.,79635,4
79636,I like this dress as it looks just like the picture.,79636,4
79636,However I ordered an xl (my usual online size) and it fits my body like a medium.,79636,4
79636,It is also much shorter than pictured.,79636,4
79637,My toes are all the way at the end of these shoes and are narrow for my wide feet.,79637,4
79638,"These were surprisingly large hoops for my nose piercing, but that's all you can expect when everyone's nose is different and pierced different.",79638,4
79638,"However, I just squeezed the hoop a little to make it a slightly tighter circle and it looks great.",79638,4
79638,I also loved getting a pack so I never have to worry about accidentally losing one and being screwed for not having another,79638,4
79639,Cute were as expected,79639,4
79641,"very very very cute, design color and fit look just like picture.",79641,4
79641,"i ordered a size up, because I'm thick thighed, and the thigh area was still a little tight.",79641,4
79641,might just be me though.,79641,4
79642,"Sizes run a little large, had to return them for a smaller size.",79642,4
79643,"This dress is super cute, the material is very heavy which is great for hiding ""flaws"" but not so great for summer.",79643,4
79643,I had been wearing with tights and boots - perfect combination.,79643,4
79643,The dress is very well made.,79643,4
79643,"I ordered a large and I am 5'1"" 160lbs, it fits great.",79643,4
79643,If I was any taller I would be a little concerned with the length if planning on wearing it without tights.,79643,4
79643,At my height it is just above my knee.,79643,4
79644,Brim was slightly bent but other than that it was perfect.,79644,4
79645,Got my Skins today.,79645,4
79645,"Now,  I am a partial foot amputee, so I purchased these to walk around the house or quick doc appts.",79645,4
79645,I have not been fitted for shoes & have been wearing socks.,79645,4
79645,I wear womens wide 10.,79645,4
79645,I got the xl in blue.,79645,4
79645,But a bad snug.,79645,4
79645,Light as a feather.,79645,4
79645,Grips the floor beautifully.,79645,4
79645,I have other issues which makes walking difficult with ANYTHING besides socks.,79645,4
79645,These keep my feet dry when raining-no more wet socks!,79645,4
79645,Im ordering 2 more pair.,79645,4
79646,Great pair of soles!,79646,4
79646,"Usually when I am working my feet start to hurt around the 5 hour mark with my old soles, but today I put in these ones and I am not limping when I get home.",79646,4
79647,They first appeared large but fit well.,79647,4
79648,I'm 5'3 and It fits and looks exactly like the picture.,79648,4
79649,"Not thrilled with the pads, but are easily removed.",79649,4
79650,"It's a little roomy, but I think the next size smaller would have been too small.",79650,4
79650,It's a nice quality fabric and well made.,79650,4
79651,"a little sharp on the neck sometimes, I can't really sleep in it, but my sister and I love them",79651,4
79653,The quality of this was great.,79653,4
79653,The paint on the metal seems to resist scratches rather well.,79653,4
79653,"I tried using this as my daily wallet,but it is simply too small to support all my cards,and it is more tricky to get your cards in and out than it is in your tradional leather wallet.",79653,4
79653,"Bear in mind that I only have 6 cards,including my driver's license,health care,debit and membership cards.",79653,4
79653,"Rather then return it,I've decided to use it to store a copy of my driver's license,care and health insurance cards,and some cash in my car in case of emergencies.",79653,4
79653,"I also use very occasionally when I'm going out at night and I only take my ID,a debit card,and a bit of cash.",79653,4
79653,I would recommend it if you only have 2-3 cards and cash.,79653,4
79653,4 I would say is the limit.,79653,4
79653,Definitely not for 5+ cards.,79653,4
79655,The pearl necklace was nice but they could be a little longer,79655,4
79657,"Nice quality, but too small for my head.",79657,4
79658,Product was as expected.,79658,4
79658,Long time to get though.,79658,4
79659,"Definitely not sterling silver, but the description doesn't claim it is, nor did I expect it for the price.",79659,4
79660,Very soft shirt...roomy in the arms.,79660,4
79660,Only complaint is that it's a bit short.,79660,4
79660,Otherwise great shirt...already ordered another one with a different design.,79660,4
79661,It came straight on time & sadly it's tha wrong size,79661,4
79662,We got this hat for our 2 year old.,79662,4
79662,My only issue is that I wish the cord was elastic.,79662,4
79662,The cord is not elastic and sometimes the fastener moves and then the hat falls off.,79662,4
79665,I wanted the large to fit like a 34DD ideally but I couldn't be so lucky.,79665,4
79665,It is more like a 36D.,79665,4
79665,The large bottoms fit me and I wear a juniors 7 or a women's 4 in pants.,79665,4
79665,Overall it's a close fit but not comfortable enough I expect to wear much.,79665,4
79666,The dress is beautiful but was a  puffy in the stomach area I could not fill the stomach part out.,79666,4
79666,But as I said it is very nice just need to have it altered if it puffs.,79666,4
79667,Fit a little snug but perfect for playing in the snow for a short period of time.,79667,4
79668,Great for a second life on a old casio watch.,79668,4
79668,could have been longer.,79668,4
79669,I recently wore it to an evening wedding.,79669,4
79669,It is comfortable and the material makes it lay and feel nice but isn't too hot either.,79669,4
79669,The blue color is a very pretty shade.,79669,4
79669,It's vibrant without being overwhelming.,79669,4
79669,I wish I would have bought a larger size.,79669,4
79669,It does run a bit small.,79669,4
79670,My daughter (4 years old) wore these shoes for my brothers wedding.,79670,4
79670,She had them on from 10:00AM until 8:00PM.,79670,4
79671,"I ordered a gray one and a navy one came, but I decided that I would just keep the navy one",79671,4
79672,its good for around the house or under a dress but I wouldn't wear it alone in public if you want something loose get a size bigger than you normally would,79672,4
79674,"**THE PHOTO ATTACHED IS AFTER I GOT IT HEMMED**

The fabric of the skirt is very pretty, but the quality of sewing is quite bad.",79674,4
79674,The zipper is pretty terrible.,79674,4
79674,I am a size 8 and bought a size large because the reviews said it fit was somewhat small and I was right to do so.,79674,4
79674,It fits very well.,79674,4
79674,"However, I am 5'2"" and it was waaaay too long.",79674,4
79674,It looked pretty matronly on me.,79674,4
79674,So I had it hemmed a whole four inches so it hits me at the top of my knees and it's a very nice look.,79674,4
79674,"I am actually quite happy with this purchase, as after the alteration it looks very classy.",79674,4
79674,Even if I have to get the zipper replaced someday I am very pleased with the skirt.,79674,4
79674,It's worth $20 for sure.,79674,4
79675,Lightweight and nicely packaged.,79675,4
79676,I enjoy using this waist trainor.,79676,4
79676,"It is just a little tight, but it's supposed to feel tight in order for it to work for what I've been told.",79676,4
79676,It's worth paying for!,79676,4
79677,I really can't review this properly because it was a gift for my best friend.,79677,4
79677,But I did like it when I saw it......only a little too small,79677,4
79678,I wish I had gotten this shirt a size smaller.,79678,4
79678,I'm 5'3 and I got the XXL and it touches my knees.,79678,4
79678,I'm hoping it'll shrink within time.,79678,4
79678,It definitely is very comfortable to wear.,79678,4
79679,Have used only for a couple of weeks.,79679,4
79679,"So far, have had no issues with it - looks pretty sturdy.",79679,4
79679,"Would have rated a full five, if they let you buy more than one case without having to pay $10.00 as shipping charge on each item.",79679,4
79679,"I mean, if you are shipping a couple of items to the same customer on one order, that is a bit of an overcharge for shipping.",79679,4
79680,Beautiful can't wait to wear them!,79680,4
79681,My daughter loves these pants!,79681,4
79681,Medium fit her well but no stretch to the pant.,79681,4
79681,Good quality and looks great on her!,79681,4
79682,My daughtered ordered this to use as the main part of her Halloween costume.,79682,4
79682,Ordered XS (she is 5ft tall) Fit just the way she wanted it to!,79682,4
79683,I ordered a small and put it on the loosest knotch and it fits fine!,79683,4
79683,I wanted this way I can adjust when I see results.,79683,4
79683,The only thing is maybe bc I have a small torso the top of the corset lays right under my boobs making it uncomfortable.,79683,4
79683,It's my first time wearing it so we'll see how it goes!,79683,4
79684,"I am obsessed with Ursula and when I found this, I had to have it.",79684,4
79684,I'm giving it a 4 stars because 2 hours after I had set the time the battery died so now I have to buy a new battery.,79684,4
79685,This was a nice little tie tack!,79685,4
79685,"The size is just right, and it looks nice.",79685,4
79685,The only trouble we had is that if you use it on...let's say not you nicest of ties...it has a tendency to catch and mess up the fabric a bit.,79685,4
79685,"However, that may be an issue of all tie tacks, this is honestly the first and only one I have ever purchased, so I hate to rag on it too much for something that may be a widespread challenge with products like this!",79685,4
79687,It was exactly what I was looking for,79687,4
79688,Love the bathing suit but the sizing runs small.,79688,4
79688,I know what size I wear but it is about 2 sizes too small.,79688,4
79688,At least that gives me a goal to reach for.,79688,4
79691,It's very cute but a cheap metal that made my entire ankle break out and itch.,79691,4
79691,It was cheap enough where im not too upset to not be able to wear it all the time.,79691,4
79691,It came very fast.,79691,4
79693,I liked this product.,79693,4
79693,My baby is 8lbs 9 oz but hasn't fully filled out his body yet so it was somewhat large on him but still looked great.,79693,4
79694,It is so cute but small,79694,4
79695,"They're pretty thin, not like running leggings, more like footless tights.",79695,4
79696,Love the shirt I received.,79696,4
79696,My only complaint is that the color was a bit off.,79696,4
79696,It was more green than teal.,79696,4
79696,"Otherwise, I love it.",79696,4
79697,Love it but the ink/decal is VERY think and I worry that after a few washes it may crack.,79697,4
79698,I loved them but they were a bit long.,79698,4
79698,I made them work though.,79698,4
79699,Small amount bulky and tight in the ankles until you wear them in.,79699,4
79699,I am petite and wear a size 5 shoe .,79699,4
79699,I can't find the cvs brand that are perfect .,79699,4
79699,This are really too fat for my shoes but I will keep looking I would rebuy these.,79699,4
79699,I am way too picky.,79699,4
79700,"Beautiful color, complimented a lot.",79700,4
79700,"With shoulders pulled down, length ok as a dress.",79700,4
79700,But not with sleeves up,79700,4
79701,"The pants were nice, but the zipper was really crooked.",79701,4
79702,"It's a bit puffier and bigger than I expected, but it feels great and looks great!!!",79702,4
79702,"The ear part isn't flat on the side that touches your ear, but it blocks the wind well enough!",79702,4
79703,Looks extremely small out of the package but stretches a lot.,79703,4
79703,"Still a little snug and low fitting, but I'm a 38 and these still fit!",79703,4
79703,"If you like a pretty snug fit they will be good, but if it irritates to have a tight fitting thong these won't be good.",79703,4
79703,Maybe for a 32 waist or so they would be good.,79703,4
79704,It can fit on any finger by simply bending it,79704,4
79705,Small in the waist,79705,4
79706,The leather was not as soft as I expected.,79706,4
79708,you have to read the reviews.,79708,4
79708,These are Asian sizes.,79708,4
79708,"I usually wear an xlarge,but in these I ordered 5x and it was perfect.",79708,4
79709,"This bag is cute, but it's a bit big for my personal preference.",79709,4
79709,"Also, more pockets on the inside would improve this product greatly.",79709,4
79709,I am not a fan of all my items sitting in a pile at the bottom of the bag.,79709,4
79709,"I think the style and pattern are wonderful, though!",79709,4
79711,"Cutting fits me nicely, material is a bit thin, it's Gd for me as I am from a very hot country",79711,4
79712,gift for nephew and he has not gotext them yet but looks good feels good and appears to fit,79712,4
79713,Cute but had a tendency to slip off my ear.,79713,4
79714,"the dress is quite lovely and will need to be altered as I am 5'4"" and the dress is clearly intended for someone at least 6 inches taller",79714,4
79715,"it's nice, great for the price and soft material",79715,4
79717,Runs a bit small in the shirt!,79717,4
79717,"I ordered a large and could button all of them (38C), but only with some serious effort and obvious strain on the outfit.",79717,4
79717,"However, I have a large tattoo chest piece and found it looked even sexier if I just did the bottom button.",79717,4
79717,All in all a success!,79717,4
79717,The skirt has a wraparound Velcro closure and looked very nice whether I cinched it tight or gave myself room to breathe.,79717,4
79717,The only thing I found odd was I got stockings instead of the hair bows?,79717,4
79717,"I'm okay with it as my hair is very short right now, but it wasn't advertised that way to me.",79717,4
79718,I like these scrub caps.,79718,4
79718,"They are adjustable, although if you have an unusually large head these might be a little tight.",79718,4
79718,"My head is pretty average, and I had to tighten mine a little.",79718,4
79718,I was worried that I would have to switch to a hair band.,79718,4
79718,"Fortunately, there is so much vertical room that I can wear my plastic hair claw clip with the hat on.",79718,4
79718,I have gotten several compliments on my paisley one.,79718,4
79719,It is comfortable and cute.,79719,4
79719,Snap buttons are pain to close especially at night.,79719,4
79720,"Product came with a defect, but seller was fast to refund partial payment instead of returning them.",79720,4
79720,I plan to wear them for a night out in vegas....WISH ME LUCK!,79720,4
79720,Will submit new review after...,79720,4
79721,This is a really pretty dress!,79721,4
79721,"It has a liner halfway down, but may be a tad sheer in the bright sun.",79721,4
79721,I might wear a half slip under it.,79721,4
79721,"I'm 5'2"" and normally a small.",79721,4
79721,I ordered a medium and it's just beyond my feet in length.,79721,4
79723,Only real inconvenience is that it's all see-thorough!,79723,4
79723,But I bought a slip and love the dress!,79723,4
79725,Nice but not for me,79725,4
79726,"It's a little flimsy, but the material is all made of very high quality.",79726,4
79727,Item came faster than expected.,79727,4
79727,I think it's gorgeous and fits me well.,79727,4
79727,"I am 5'4, 124lbs, and a 34b.",79727,4
79727,I ordered a size small.,79727,4
79728,A bit small but stretch well.,79728,4
79728,They are super soft.,79728,4
79729,"My wife bought this dress in a small, she is 5'2 and it goes past her knees.",79729,4

79729,She also says it is comfortable and soft cotton.,79729,4
79730,I'm 146 pounds and I got the medium.,79730,4
79730,Wish I got the large because I got it for work however I'll put a cardi over it and rock out.,79730,4
79731,This is a very beautiful ring.,79731,4
79731,The fit was nice and the color was nice.,79731,4
79731,I do wish it was a little bit more orange.,79731,4
79731,I received lots of compliments.,79731,4
79732,"I like this hat, but the only thing is it won't stay as tight as I need it to and falls out of place on my 3 month olds head.",79732,4
79732,But other than that its awesome!,79732,4
79732,"Does the job, protects my babies head and neck and keeps the sun out of his eyes.",79732,4
79732,And he looks so adorable in it too!,79732,4
79733,A touch small and not the most flexible material.,79733,4
79733,Front pouch would also benefit from some more room.,79733,4
79733,"I am not overly blessed, but adequately blessed, and as our excitement grows, so does the level of discomfort.",79733,4
79733,"Otherwise, pleased with the purchase.",79733,4
79734,Just received these a couple of days ago and they were pretty much as I expected given the price you pay for them.,79734,4
79734,"The stitching is loose, the material is a bit flat, and they came with a pretty noticeable crease at the center line, but for the price you pay, they're fairly decent.",79734,4
79734,Wore the green dual tone at work and got many compliments.,79734,4
79734,"Why pay $50+ for a tie when you can get three, functional pieces for a third the cost?",79734,4
79735,"good, I am size 33 or L USA They have to be pending with carvings.",79735,4
79736,Delivered timely and fits as expected.,79736,4
79736,"I like the product a lot, just wish it came in more colors than back and white.",79736,4
79737,"was  a  little  dissapointed  in  the  quality  of  material,  but  overall  it  was  good",79737,4
79738,"Nothing Special, bought for a Halloween Costume but is nice enough to use for other occasions",79738,4
79739,It wasn't white enough.,79739,4
79739,It's my fault it says off white and its really off white.,79739,4
79740,I'm satisfied with my purchase.,79740,4
79741,We got these for my daughter's 1950's waitress outfit.,79741,4
79741,She especially likes the purple color as it matches her costume.,79741,4
79742,Bag had a small hole on the inside but was an easy fix,79742,4
79743,I really love the bangle.,79743,4
79743,It is heavy but it is really small.,79743,4
79743,"I have small hands and wrists and I had to oil my hand to get it on, but once on it fits my wrist perfectly.",79743,4
79743,I just won't take it off anytime soon.,79743,4
79744,Got this for my grandson.,79744,4
79746,"These gowns are so cute, I'd like to wear them as dresses!",79746,4
79746,Seem well-suited to nursing.,79746,4
79747,They do run a bit small though.,79747,4
79748,my mother loved it.,79748,4
79748,very cute and soft.,79748,4
79748,Took a while to get there since it ships from China.,79748,4
79749,"I like the color, but I order a small and looks like a sack on me.",79749,4
79749,Maybe needs a vest or belt to bring in a little.,79749,4
79750,"My daughter was very happy to get this since it was a little tight on me, but very cute!",79750,4
79752,"Wish the top was an actual sweater and the skirt wasn't so thin, BUT it is an awesome costume and everyone loved it!",79752,4
79753,"Creepers are never going to be the most orthopedic correct shoes, and these are no exception.",79753,4
79753,The soles are awfully stiff.,79753,4
79753,So much so that I couldn't even walk in them after putting gel inserts in.,79753,4
79753,"I don't regret this purchase, but I doubt I'll be wearing these for anything but a special occasion.",79753,4
79754,This necklace is so pretty!,79754,4
79754,It looks exactly like the picture shown including the length.,79754,4
79754,It took about three weeks to recieve but was worth the wait and my daughter has already borrowed it!,79754,4
79755,This dress is beautiful and exactly as pictured.,79755,4
79755,"However, it weighs a ton.",79755,4
79755,Maybe my fault for not asking but it is much heavier than it looks.,79755,4
79755,One definitely needs help getting it on and lacing it up.,79755,4
79755,I am unable to wear it as planned.,79755,4
79757,I have not purchased any maternity pants.,79757,4
79757,Still able to use this band at 31 weeks.,79757,4
79757,I use it folded over in half but so you can still use the grippy silicone.,79757,4
79757,The silicone seems to be a very important feature.,79757,4
79757,I don't think I would like this as much without it.,79757,4
79757,I do have one pair of pants that still fits without the band and I prefer to wear them as much as I can.,79757,4
79757,"The band is effective, but makes your pockets unusable and I find it a little bit of a hassle when I am using the bathroom so much and have to remove and replace it so much.",79757,4
79757,Not sure how I will like the extra fabric in summer but so far it has not been an issue.,79757,4
79758,"Very comfortable, supportive, but not as tight on the mid section as I anticipated.",79758,4
79759,I love this bathing suit!,79759,4
79759,But I'm a 2x and I ordered a 3x and it fit really snug.,79759,4
79759,Other then that I get compliments all the time!,79759,4
79760,Looks expensive and is well constructed.,79760,4
79760,In real real life a little more pink than on the picture.,79760,4
79761,"Purse is good quality soft leather, but only four stars because strap is not leather.",79761,4
79761,"Nice anyway, will see how it wears.",79761,4
79762,"It was broken in the package - off of the jump ring, which is an easy fix.",79762,4
79762,A couple of coins fell off during the initial wear but I still like the necklace.,79762,4
79763,beautiful and very shiny,79763,4
79764,"I wish the handles were longer so I could keep one handle on my should while searching through the bag, then I would't have to take the whole thing off thereby making it harder for someone to take from me.",79764,4
79764,Otherwise color is beautiful and zipper tag is adorable!,79764,4
79765,Wash it only in a lingerie bag.,79765,4
79765,It hold the vibrant colors well if washed properly in cold water.,79765,4
79766,I love the shirt but it fits smaller than expected.,79766,4
79766,Still haven't wore it but it looks nice and would have went perfect with some pants i purchased but both were smaller than I expected.,79766,4
79766,But for those it will fit you will love it.,79766,4
79767,Larger than expected but definitely high quality material,79767,4
79768,Beautiful however came with stone detached.,79768,4
79769,"Pretty but , they don't look like real diamond's .",79769,4
79770,"Ordered xlarge because of review, fits well, reviews are a great help",79770,4
79772,"Very pretty, worked really well",79772,4
79773,A little flimsy but works.,79773,4
79775,"Pretty good, costume quality of course.",79775,4
79775,"Works perfect for Halloween, costume parties.",79775,4
79777,The knit is a bit cheap.,79777,4
79777,"It is smooth and medium weight, but not at all as dressy as is the design.",79777,4
79777,I am going to cut it shorter and wear as a tunic for a performance costume instead of as a cocktail dress.,79777,4
79778,I am a huge Sailor Moon fan and was super excited to see they had SM leggings that I could wear while working out.,79778,4
79778,They fit and feel great.,79778,4
79778,"My only problem is they are see-through in the back, so wear nude coloured undergarments!",79778,4
79779,It is a bit large for my 11 year old son.,79779,4
79779,slides down his face a bit.,79779,4
79779,but I just adjust the straps whenever he subs out of the game.,79779,4
79779,"He does not complain, and would definitely rather wear this mask than not play at all.",79779,4
79780,"Bought for son, he only wears Supras.",79780,4
79780,He loves these shoes.,79780,4
79780,"The color is great, but we did apply a material protectant/waterproofer to help keep them clean.",79780,4
79781,Nice but a little balky.,79781,4
79782,"They fit well as compression underwear, but they are a bit too short for my 6'1"" frame.",79782,4
79782,"I am thin, so I had to get a smaller size, so that would probably account for that.",79782,4
79782,It's a common issue for me...,79782,4
79782,They are really soft...the ladies love it.,79782,4
79783,Flattering to to hips,79783,4
79784,"Though all are marked the same size, two fit as expected while one is somewhat larger.",79784,4
79785,Super cute and great quality for the price!,79785,4
79786,Very nice bright colors easy to coordinate.,79786,4
79787,"Necklace is wire-like and doesn't actually connect in the back, but instead overlaps.",79787,4
79787,It's not especially adjustable like a chain clasp would be.,79787,4
79787,Fits like a choker.,79787,4
79787,"""Stone"" is as depicted, and is attractive.",79787,4
79789,Ok for the price.,79789,4
79790,"The color is great, the fabric is very stretchy and comfortable.",79790,4
79790,"I usually wear a juniors 7 or 9 in skinny jeans, but based on other reviews I guessed that I should buy an 11 instead.",79790,4
79790,"I guessed correctly, luckily!",79790,4
79790,"Similar to what another reviewer said, the belt loops are barely attached--I ripped the corner of one off just trying on the jeans for the first time.",79790,4
79790,"That is easy to repair myself, but probably a sign of their construction not being that great.",79790,4
79791,It's beautiful but fits my daughter a little bit to big.,79791,4
79792,Great fit and fabric.,79792,4
79792,Very comfortable for work or out in the evening.,79792,4
79792,I'm a curvy woman and it complimented my figure.,79792,4
79793,Good price & attractive.,79793,4
79794,It's a very nice shirt but it was small.,79794,4
79794,"I'm a medium and figured a large would fit, it did Just verily.",79794,4
79795,Wife love elephants But The strap was to tight and small.,79795,4
79795,She had to buy a new watch strap that look awesome with the watch face.,79795,4
79797,"Great quality, though some of the socks sizes were inconsistent, some were bigger or smaller than others, over I'm happy with them.",79797,4
79798,It's pretty warm but part of my ears stick out if I wear it so I can see.,79798,4
79798,I use it all the time.,79798,4
79799,Disclaimer: I've never owned a cycling kit before.,79799,4
79799,This is my first foray into cycling kits.,79799,4
79799,"That being said, I love this kit.",79799,4
79799,It's incredibly comfortable and makes a huge difference on my rides.,79799,4
79799,I did order two sizes larger as recommended.,79799,4
79799,"I'm 5'10"" 215 lbs with a more muscular build.",79799,4
79799,I ordered the 2XL and it fits great!,79799,4
79800,way big and the waistband rolls.,79800,4
79800,just like all tights.,79800,4
79801,Good fit and good price.,79801,4
79802,"Good clogs, but too expensive.",79802,4
79802,Somebody needs to make a good knock-off for less price.,79802,4
79803,Seem nice and well made.,79803,4
79803,"They fit tight, which makes sense for pajamas.",79803,4
79803,"However, my daughter wanted these for a costume, and wanted a more comfortable fit, so we ended up having to return the first size and get the next bigger one for comfort.",79803,4
79805,very cute not as heavy as I thought but still nice,79805,4
79806,Overall it's a very pretty pendant.,79806,4
79806,It doesn't have any white diamonds just blue in the center heart.,79806,4
79806,But for the price is great.,79806,4
79806,I purchased this for a birthday gift and it was complimented many times.,79806,4
79807,Works as expected for dance class.,79807,4
79807,"Has a slim profile which looks good, although with the amount of floor work I've done lately, I wished there was a bit more padding.",79807,4
79809,"It's pretty and seemed of good quality, but I had to return it because it was way floppier than expected.",79809,4
79809,"The brim sagged pretty much to my shoulders, and that was more than what I wanted.",79809,4
79810,Pretty cheap quality but exactly what I expected and needed for a costume party.,79810,4
79810,Would not wear out except in a costume setting.,79810,4
79810,Too cheap looking but perfect for what i needed.,79810,4
79812,"We got this for my son, and he usually wears a medium but this was too small",79812,4
79813,They arrived sooner than expected.,79813,4
79813,"Was a little surprised when I opened the package as I had ordered a medium, but arrived XS.",79813,4
79813,"The thermals are tight, and after moving around a little they slip down.",79813,4
79814,Great for coming out of swim class!,79814,4
79815,"I loved it, but fit a little bit larger than I had wanted, but was still able to make it work.",79815,4
79816,"Good shirt, love the logo, took off one star because the material is pretty thin.",79816,4
79816,It did fit as expected (it is a tight fit so if you don't want it tight maybe order a size up) and is comfortable.,79816,4
79818,"Super cute, only complaints are I ordered gold and got silver, and the detail (as I suspected) doesn't match the picture.",79818,4
79818,I have small fingers so it fit nearly out of the package.,79818,4
79818,Did I mention it's super cute?,79818,4
79819,Fit well and nice fabric.,79819,4
79820,"its cute,  I like it and look forward to wearing it out",79820,4
79821,okay so I ordered this for a friend as a gift because she loves painting and going to museums so I thought it was perfect but I get it and all the socks are the ones that are in the picture except the scream is missing and I got some weird orange painting that we have not been able to identify but other than that high quality socks and the rest are great.,79821,4
79821,I am just weirded out bc I cannot figure out the socks painting.,79821,4
79822,Cute dainty purchased as a gift,79822,4
79823,"Most of the socks don easily, and feel comfortable.",79823,4
79823,Two of the pairs have much less stretch to the fabric.,79823,4
79823,"This makes it a bit tougher to get them on, and I'm worried I'll tear some of the threads prematurely.",79823,4
79823,"That said, the designs are fun and people notice them at work.",79823,4
79824,It fits even a little larger than the description I think.,79824,4
79824,"I wasn't sure if I should get a M or L, and thinking stuff made in China runs small I went with L. Big mistake--this shirt can go from sexy to frumpy quickly.",79824,4
79824,It's way too big and I think it would look a lot better with a snug fit.,79824,4
79824,"I tried washing and drying hot to make it shrink and no luck, though it did hold up to machine wash (despite directions not to).",79824,4
79824,"Could be a cute, comfortable shirt if I would have ordered the right size.",79824,4
79825,After washing they shrunk considerably.,79825,4
79826,"They're a lil snug in the front, but they are super comfortable to wear.",79826,4
79826,"The leg piping does tend to roll up a bit, fyi.",79826,4
79827,Love this shirt it fits so good.,79827,4
79827,The material is very nice.,79827,4
79828,Nicer without pads for everyday wear.,79828,4
79828,Last forever wash and dry great,79828,4
79829,I just ordered this in the pink color.,79829,4
79829,"I wear smaller bras so, I think that I will have plenty of room for my bras and underwear.",79829,4
79829,"I agree with other reviewers that the mesh pockets in the lid will hold nothing, they seem pointless to me.",79829,4
79830,"The outfit piece fits well, the tights are very small.",79830,4
79830,"As a matter of fact, they fit my 12 year old who is 115 pounds and wears a size 4 in junior.",79830,4
79830,"Other than that, the costume is perfect.",79830,4
79831,VERY heavy but beautiful,79831,4
79832,My daughter is a little taller than average so she will use it as an oversized shirt with leggings or capris.,79832,4
79833,Our average size baby outgrew the socks by 3.5 months.,79833,4
79834,"If you normally wear a small, go up a size and you should be fine",79834,4
79835,I purchased the 2 (Crystal and Blue) and they are both really beautiful.,79835,4
79835,Gorgeous workmanship.... higher quality than expected for the $100 price point.,79835,4
79835,"The purse arrived in protective bubble-wrap, securely packaged inside lovely designer boxes with 'satin' lining.",79835,4
79835,I am giving 4 stars rather than 5 due to the weight.,79835,4
79835,I do not think the hardware will support the weight if this purse were carried by the chain.,79835,4
79835,An adult would probably carry this as a clutch.,79835,4
79835,I purchased these adorable bunny purses as flower girl gifts.,79835,4
79835,"Unfortunately, due to the weight, they are too heavy for young girls,  so I am returning them.",79835,4
79837,Super cute and fits great!,79837,4
79838,"Nice looking shirt for the price, fits well everywhere else except the length.",79838,4
79838,It hits past mid thigh on an average sized 5.5 year old who is about 44 lbs and 43 inches height.,79838,4
79838,"Small would fit a 5 or 6 year old, but make sure he is tall or else accept this as a long tee shirt.",79838,4
79838,If you tuck in your kids shirts that would solve the problem.,79838,4
79839,"Nice hat, quality and colors.",79839,4
79839,My only issue was the difficulty preventing the hat brim from falling down over my eyes.,79839,4
79839,May fit better for someone with slightly larger head.,79839,4
79840,Excellent size for my son to take when he needs a week's worth of clothes.,79840,4
79840,It handles very nicely and is durable.,79840,4
79840,The lock is a great feature for use at summer camp or other situations to guard against tampering.,79840,4
79841,They fit good but the strap that goes around the bottom the Velcro is not holding good.,79841,4
79841,May have to get the Velcro replaced.,79841,4
79842,Works great as it was intended.,79842,4
79842,Just a bit smaller than I was expecting.,79842,4
79843,"Fit well, but a lot of loose threads.",79843,4
79844,I am looking for the perfect top to wear with this,79844,4
79845,large fits more like medium  but other then that its cute,79845,4
79846,A little thin but fits well and washes well.,79846,4
79847,These shorts are just the right length.,79847,4
79847,I've had some before that were just too long.,79847,4
79847,The fabric these are made of is great too...they don't get super saggy when wet.,79847,4
79847,I will be ordering another pair one size smaller.,79847,4
79848,It cute but too small,79848,4
79849,I like that the glasses are very dark but it has a smear imbedded the lenses that doesn't wipe off but also doesn't block my view.,79849,4
79849,Have gotten more attention with these glasses.,79849,4
79851,The magnetic hold seems strong.,79851,4
79851,"I wish it said ""Johnston & Murphy"" on the outside as opposed to the inside though.",79851,4
79852,Love the look of the shirt but for an extra large it is running a bit small.,79852,4
79852,Very good looking shirt,79852,4
79853,"I bought these for my niece, she wears a size 8 shoe, but these are large.",79853,4
79854,"Fast delivery, great fit",79854,4
79856,"I like it, but I didn get and the selles gave me my money, THANK YOU VERY MUCH",79856,4
79857,Fabric of good quality; Slightly larger that same size of department stores brands,79857,4
79858,"Really liked the suit, but after one washing the underwire popped out.",79858,4
79859,Fit smaller than expected.,79859,4
79859,I wear an 8/10 with thick thighs and had a hard time getting them half way up my thighs.,79859,4
79860,This is one of my new favorite shirts.,79860,4
79860,So comfortable and perfect with leggings.,79860,4
79860,It is pretty sheer though.,79860,4
79860,A white cami under is perfect.,79860,4
79861,Just way too big for me.,79861,4
79861,"I do wish they were made according to different sizes, instead of being one size only.",79861,4
79861,But I can probably wear it as a beach cover or wear it with leggings.,79861,4
79861,"Either way, I will make it work",79861,4
79862,Was a little small but works well as a rain jacket and wind breaker,79862,4
79863,If your into that sort of thing.,79863,4
79864,The pants seem to fit fine but the shirt is disproportionately small.,79864,4
79864,Wish I'd bought a size up as they're very cute but will be outgrown quickly.,79864,4
79865,Very cute bellow button ring.,79865,4
79865,Hasn't turned green or anything.,79865,4
79865,Only thing I'm unhappy with is the ball fell off the 2nd day of having it in.,79865,4
79866,I bought this for my wife for an 80s them party.,79866,4
79867,Loved the top n it's fitting.,79867,4
79868,I ordered 3 of these sweaters in different styles.,79868,4
79868,One of them is a tiny bit tight in the armpits but otherwise I love them.,79868,4
79868,Fit as expected and look great!,79868,4
79870,Nice hat but was a bit to large for me.,79870,4
79871,"I really like this pullover, looks just like on the picture.",79871,4
79871,I just wish I ordered size bigger than I usually wear.,79871,4
79872,my wife loves it.but she said she just can't sit down anywhere should have got a different color but overall I'll give it a 4 product.,79872,4
79873,I bought this shirt.,79873,4
79873,"When I got, it was so soft and help me be cooler with this warm weather.",79873,4
79873,"It's thin, but not so thin that you can see everything underneath it.",79873,4
79873,If this product will hold up to multiple washings then it's a good product.,79873,4
79875,Well made and looks good,79875,4
79876,"This pendant is very pretty, although it's kind of flimsy and definitely feels cheap.",79876,4
79876,"That isn't a problem for me, but anyone looking for a product that feels high quality wouldn't like this.",79876,4
79876,The chain works well for me and the clasp isn't difficult to use.,79876,4
79876,"The locket opens, and while mine doesn't actually have a little bead or stone inside, the inside is painted with glow in the dark paint.",79876,4
79876,"When I first received I thought there was supposed to be a stone, and the back didn't glow, but after a few days I noticed that it actually does glow - I guess it just needed more light exposure than I expected.",79876,4
79876,"The finish on mine is silver-colored, but does not look like antiqued silver as described.",79876,4
79876,"The chain will probably turn your neck green after a lot of wear, but I haven't worn mine frequently enough for that to happen.",79876,4
79876,"Since I paid $2 for it, I didn't expect anything higher quality, and I'm totally okay with that.",79876,4
79877,I love love love the way this looks and fits my wife.,79877,4
79878,Think I will like them.,79878,4
79879,"I Bought these for my girlfriend, SHE LOVED THEM, I actually bought different colors and patterns that made her look sexy hot.",79879,4
79879,"Will by more, or she will.",79879,4
79880,fits a little big but its okay because he will grow into it.,79880,4
79880,the material is great.,79880,4
79880,not to heavy and easy to zipper.,79880,4
79883,A little snug in the arms.,79883,4
79884,"For this price it fits great, breathable, and very comfy.",79884,4
79884,"I'm a 36B/C, 30"" waist, 34"" hips, ordered the large and it fits just the one the model is wearing fits her.",79884,4
79884,Ordered this with a bunch of other gals to get team names printed for a mud-run.,79884,4
79885,I got a S and M. I am 5 foot 4 and weigh 140.,79885,4
79885,I am a size 4 in Old Navy Jeans.,79885,4
79885,The Small is great other than it is a little snug in the waist.,79885,4
79885,The Mediums are too big in the waist and around the calf.,79885,4
79885,They shrink a little with washing but stretch back out easily.,79885,4
79885,Mediums are definitely more comfortable.,79885,4
79886,I love the nice dark shiny blue on my darksin!,79886,4
79886,It fits perfectly except my butt.,79886,4
79886,"Im skinny with a booty and the bottoms are a bit tight but thats ok cus i never go fully naked at the beach, i always wear shorts.",79886,4

79886,Lovely color and great fit!.,79886,4
79886,"Incase u wondering
Im 120 n 5'4",79886,4
79887,"Fit nicely and comfortably, although it's see-through if you're in a well lit area.",79887,4
79887,I wore a black thong and bra underneath and it was fine.,79887,4
79889,It arrived on time and was as described.,79889,4
79890,Colors are a bit faded.,79890,4
79890,still super cute though,79890,4
79891,"Too big, had to get altered but absolutely beautiful dress and very well made",79891,4
79892,"This dress is really pretty but because of the way the waist lies, it really is designed for a tall person.",79892,4
79892,I had to send it back as the waist sat too low on me.,79892,4
79894,This was one of the gifts I gave my niece on her 23rd birthday.,79894,4
79895,"Adorable, fit as expectedl.",79895,4
79896,The Zoe and Ella Hammered Metal Palladium Plated earrings arrived and looked just like the picture.,79896,4
79896,I was pleased with their design and style and for that reason I give them 4 stars.,79896,4
79896,"However, I am allergic to nickel and was hoping that the palladium plating would be enough to make the earrings hypo allergenic for me.",79896,4
79896,One of my ears flared bright red and itchy while the other was not as bad.,79896,4
79896,I cannot say whether that's due to metal content variance in the earrings or just my ears.,79896,4
79896,"If you don't have any sensitivity issues, these earrings are great and could be worn for everyday to evenings out.",79896,4
79897,"I read reviews and knew I should order one size bigger than standard, I did and it fits and feels great.",79897,4
79898,Love it  so cute #goodbuy fit nicely and it's very sexy,79898,4
79899,Looks too tight on the bottom if you have long legs.,79899,4
79901,very comfortable to wear.,79901,4
79902,Love the look of this dress.,79902,4
79902,Its gorgeous and sexy.,79902,4
79902,"And in case any one is wondering, milk silk is polyester.",79902,4
79903,I really like this bubble statement necklace.,79903,4
79903,I had a few issues with this necklace when I first ordered it.,79903,4
79903,The necklace was well packaged.,79903,4
79903,"I wore the necklace one time and within a few hours, the necklace was falling apart.",79903,4
79903,I contacted the EnyaJewelry who quickly replaced my necklace.,79903,4
79903,I have had no issue's with the new necklace that I was sent.,79903,4
79903,I have ordered other necklaces from the EnyaJewelry and have not had a single issue.,79903,4
79903,"I have also ordered this same bubble statement necklace, in different colors and have not had a problem.",79903,4
79903,"I will continue to purchase from them, because you can not beat their price when it comes to costume jewelry.",79903,4
79904,Decent set for a decent price.,79904,4
79904,O rings are a little loose for the size though,79904,4
79905,Great price for all-inclusive package!,79905,4
79906,Nice wallet - buthas a strange smell - hoping it goes away.,79906,4
79907,"For the price, it is great",79907,4
79908,"Other than the front pockets being slightly small to put my hands through, the overall quality is great.",79908,4
79908,I followed the chart they provided to find my right converted size and I received a well fitted coat.,79908,4
79908,"Like I said, the quality and material is great.",79908,4
79908,The stitching is spot on and the fabric doesn't look or feel cheap.,79908,4
79909,The posts were lose when I got them.,79909,4
79909,Had to fix then before wearing them.,79909,4
79910,I have arthritis in my feet and a big cyst on the top of one foot.,79910,4
79910,I work all day on concrete floors and up & down ladders.,79910,4
79910,No time to worry about foot pain.,79910,4
79910,"The inserts help, but by the end of the day I am more than ready to get my shoes off.",79910,4
79910,"I had a pair of better inserts from the foot Dr. , but can't afford those every 6 months.",79910,4
79910,So I am giving yours a try.,79910,4
79910,"So far
I've been happy with them.",79910,4
79910,Next time I'd like to order a pair that's a little stiffer maybe.,79910,4
79910,Otherwise it's THUMBS UP from me.,79910,4
79911,The quality was pleasantly surprising and the fit was perfect.,79911,4
79911,"I got a medium and my drop waist is about 40"" and my normal waist is about 36"".",79911,4
79912,The large fit a little snug and the extra large fit huge around the arms.,79912,4
79912,A little disappointed but otherwise the quality of the fabric and print were great.,79912,4
79912,Love me some Pete.,79912,4
79913,fine quality it's a bit too small if u have a big nose lol,79913,4
79914,"Shorter than in the picture, but still looks and feels amazing",79914,4
79915,Somewhat small but still very pretty,79915,4
79916,Not the color depicted in the picture.,79916,4
79916,More of an orange ted.,79916,4
79918,Great hat for a baby.,79918,4
79918,Adjusts to fit and good sun protection.,79918,4
79919,"Nice quality shirt, it is very fitted in the waist.",79919,4
79919,I'd say if you don't want it too snug size up.,79919,4
79919,It runs on the small side but is stretchy.,79919,4
79919,"I like that is not too short, as I have a long torso.",79919,4
79919,Machine washable and tumble dry low.,79919,4
79920,little short and stiff but pretty uch what I was looking for,79920,4
79921,Small on the length and sleeve length and the zipper is on the wrong side.,79921,4
79921,I like the style and color and it has a decent amount of padding to keep you warm.,79921,4
79922,I have to say that I was very pleased with these glasses.,79922,4
79922,They were the perfect size and in perfect condition.,79922,4
79922,One thing I didn't appreciate was the absence of the micro fiber bag.,79922,4
79922,My glasses only came in what appeared to be a little clear Ziploc bag.,79922,4
79922,"That false advertisement was quite a dissappointment, besides that everything was great.",79922,4
79924,"This is a beautiful sweater, but it runs extremely large.",79924,4
79924,"I ordered a small, and, it was huge, on me.",79924,4
79924,"For a flattering fit, I'd need an XXS, though my general size, in most clothing, is small.",79924,4
79924,"The subtle two tone effect is lovely, as well as the stitching, which is why I am giving it 4 stars.",79924,4
79924,"It is not extremely soft, and it has a slightly rough texture, which may improve with time.",79924,4
79924,"I loved the color, a neutral beige, but, unfortunately, I have to send it back.",79924,4
79925,"I like the bra, it came in a cute bag and it came prompt.",79925,4
79925,I am a 34C and I ordered a Medium.,79925,4
79925,"It works, but if I grow any I think my boobs might fall out hahahaha, but it does its job.",79925,4
79925,I haven't used it for high impact training but its very comfortable!,79925,4
79926,This is a very beautiful dress.,79926,4
79926,I am 5.2 and I am between sizes 12& 16.,79926,4
79926,I ordered a XXL and it fits ok - just slightly big.,79926,4
79926,I could have gotten away with XL but that is ok.,79926,4
79926,I am keeping it.,79926,4
79928,Like the weight of the material.,79928,4
79929,"Nice sleek design , smooth operation and a quality leather .",79929,4
79930,Beautiful dress not too fond of the lace up back though,79930,4
79931,"Looks a bit odd with my head size (pretty small, but I wear my hats tight).",79931,4
79931,This thing has a bit of a ledge sticking out over the back of my head since the strap at the back is set to a relatively small setting.,79931,4
79932,Beautiful dressReally wished the size was somewhat close,79932,4
79933,"Its very cute, especially if you like volleyball and coffee.",79933,4
79933,"It is a tighter fit than you would expect so if you want a looser fit, order a size up, but it still is really a neat shirt.",79933,4
79937,These are adorable and I am planning on packing them for my cruise next week!,79937,4
79937,They're pretty stretchy but somewhat see-through so be careful!,79937,4
79937,Perfect for a Halloween costume.,79937,4
79938,"The belt is overall a quality item, the leather is fair quality with stitching that goes through the belt and isn't just cosmetic looking.",79938,4
79938,The buckle is securely attached and the metal seems good quality.,79938,4
79938,I'm a little sore about the sizing though.,79938,4
79938,A size 40 was too small and a size 44 too large.,79938,4
79938,I should have ordered a size 42 but seeing as this was primarily ordered for a family event there wasn't enough time to return and re-order.,79938,4
79938,"Normally a size 38-40 fits me perfectly, but with this belt, for some reason it did not.",79938,4
79938,For that I am subtracting a star.,79938,4
79938,"I would reorder this belt again, albeit in a smaller size.",79938,4
79938,"And yes,I would recommend this belt to others.",79938,4
79939,Just as i expected..,79939,4
79941,"Watch body looks great, bracelet looks OK but is cheap and as this strong chemical odor .",79941,4
79941,I Put a other bracelet on it .,79941,4
79941,"I only got the watch 2 days ago, but look wise with a upgrade bracelet it is a great looking watch",79941,4
79942,I got it sooner than expected and I'm fully satisfied.,79942,4
79944,"Easy to open and close, comfortable to wear.",79944,4
79944,It did fall out once while I was sleeping.,79944,4
79945,"Lightweight almost to the point that you forget it's there, thin, very nice looking watch.",79945,4
79945,Most casual watch wearers notice it and it makes for a nice conversation due to it's uniqueness.,79945,4
79945,I've worn this watch for a about a month now.,79945,4
79945,I personally love the soft leather wristband.,79945,4
79945,It feels cheap at first but it forms to your wrist and feels great.,79945,4
79945,I've accidentally knocked it a couple of times too...not a single scuff.,79945,4
79945,The one issue I'm having trouble with is setting the time.,79945,4
79945,According to the instructions you have to set the time for ~5-8 minutes in advance if I remember correctly.,79945,4
79945,On top of that it seemingly runs much slower than expected.,79945,4
79945,But I've gotten past those issues and it's turned into my everyday,79945,4
79946,Its a little bigger...,79946,4
79947,Good quality material the type that should last a while...,79947,4
79948,"Son bought me Costa's and I needed a case, the price was right and product is good.",79948,4
79949,"Good product, but I'd expect nothing less from Hanes.",79949,4
79949,"I was surprised that they were not longer - they are not TOO short, but another inch would have been excellent!",79949,4
79949,"(I'm six foot tall)  However, they are extremely comfortable and didn't leave ten pounds of ""fuzz"" in the dryer when I washed them.",79949,4
79950,The material is of good quality.,79950,4
79950,I am 5'1 and ordered an XS and the dress is a bit long.,79950,4
79950,If I tip toe then it is the perfect length.,79950,4
79950,So if you are 5'3 or 5'4 the length would be perfect for you.,79950,4
79951,Nice top but it was way too big for me ...,79951,4
79952,Very comfy hat to keep me warm day or night.,79952,4
79952,I have a medical condition that affects my core body temperature sometimes.,79952,4
79952,You lose heat out of the top of your head so the light weight hat helps to keep my body core temperature warm.,79952,4
79952,The hat runs a little big tho.,79952,4
79952,I still love it anyways.,79952,4
79953,"For the price, these are very nice sunglasses.",79953,4
79954,"I don't really like the chain it comes with, but it's easy enough to replace",79954,4
79955,"I have a 15"" Mac Pro and it's to small for it.",79955,4
79956,Beautiful pendant especially if you wear it with a black shirt.,79956,4
79956,FYI the chain is very short.,79956,4
79956,I had to put it on a different chain.,79956,4
79957,"Ridiculously soft, silky material.",79957,4
79957,Not see through from what I've seen so far.,79957,4
79957,I recommend buying a size larger than what you think you need.,79957,4
79957,"Other than that, lovely product.",79957,4
79958,"Very thin shirt, but very cute.",79958,4
79958,Need to wear something under it.,79958,4
79959,"I am 5'4, 137 lbs, and I bought the XL.",79959,4
79959,Love the color-I bought the purple which is more like a plum color.,79959,4
79959,Sleeves are more like a 3/4 sleeve but very cute and can be dressed up.,79959,4
79960,"I was 20 weeks pregnant at the time I wore this and I was initially worried the medium may be a little small but it was a tad too big, even with my growing bump.",79960,4
79960,"I am 5'6, normally of average build but even with the pregnancy weight, I was able to zip it up with room to spare.",79960,4
79960,"Based on the medium's fit, I probably could have done just fine with ordering a small, especially if I choose to reuse it when not pregnant!",79960,4
79960,"The sleeves were a bit awkward fitting, a tad too loose but not noticeably bad.",79960,4
79960,"Otherwise, the quality was decent considering it is a costume.",79960,4
79960,"I received quite a few compliments, but then again I was partnered with my three year old who was dressed as a T-Bird and they were probably geared towards him :)",79960,4
79961,Nice for the inexpensive price.,79961,4
79962,Arrived in only 9 days!,79962,4
79962,It is cheap material but what do you expect for the money?,79962,4
79962,"It runs on the smaller side, so keep that in mind.",79962,4
79963,"First, I just realized that these say ""touchscreen"" gloves.",79963,4
79963,"They do not work on touchscreen, but this is not why I bought them.",79963,4
79963,"(I mainly bought them because they were same-day delivery and they looked stylish and similar to a Calvin Klein set of gloves that I really like)

These are very warm gloves and will make your fingers feel warm and snuggly when the outside temperature is certainly not warm.",79963,4
79963,"The color is very warm, in that it is a light camel color.",79963,4
79963,The actual color seems a little more light and little more warm...which I am not complaining about.,79963,4
79963,I think they look better in person than online.,79963,4
79963,"I like this purchase, but now knowing that they are supposed to be ""touchscreen"", I'm not sure if I would buy these again.",79963,4
79964,more like hooded shirt,79964,4
79965,"I wear normally XXS to S sizes and I ordered a L size because I expected it to run small after reading other reviews and because I am 4,5 months pregnant and expect to use it in vacation in a couple of weeks.",79965,4
79965,"I tried it yesterday and it is ok, still runs somehow small.",79965,4
79965,Other than that is a cute swimsuit.,79965,4
79966,In the Dept store the cost would have been $40.,79966,4
79968,was a gift and liked very much,79968,4
79969,"The sleeves are poofy, girly and cute.",79969,4
79969,"It's not very thick but it is very soft and cozy, only real complaint is that there are no pockets.",79969,4
79969,Since these are Asian sizes you want to go up at least 2 sizes.,79969,4
79969,"I'm 5'2 130lbs (average bust and small waist), I normally wear a small jacket but ordered a large and it fits like a glove!",79969,4
79970,I love it but it was to small on my boobs.,79970,4
79970,Didn't cover my whole chest.,79970,4
79970,but i love the color combo,79970,4
79971,"Super soft, super gorgeous, fits me perfectly.",79971,4
79971,"My only issue with it is that you MUST hang it immediately when it's done in the dryer, or else it will wrinkly badly.",79971,4
79972,"It was perfect i love it,but it came incomplete because it didn't came with the collectors card and the special collectors box bouth printed iwith original comics  that you announce.",79972,4
79972,Very sad about it.,79972,4
79973,Lace sleeves were a bit snug and not as pretty as picture lead to believe but general quality and color were great especially considering the price!,79973,4
79974,"I ordered the royal blue, but it is navy blue.",79974,4
79974,I ordered 2 more in different colors.,79974,4
79976,Beautiful jacket and looks like picture.,79976,4
79976,The BIG however is the sizing.,79976,4
79976,I bought an XL because I am a D-cup.,79976,4
79976,The jacket is super snug around the boobs which makes it uncomfortable.,79976,4
79977,This runs a little small in my opinion.,79977,4
79977,But my husband loves it anyways.,79977,4
79978,Very cute and casual- lots of complements,79978,4
79979,The balls are bigger than I am used to.,79979,4
79979,Kinda wish they were a tad smaller.,79979,4
79980,i like the shirt but i was WAYYYY small and i still ordered too big.,79980,4
79980,"BUT i know the sizing is different, just cant wear it just yet",79980,4
79981,Dont shy away from this set because of the low price.,79981,4
79981,I recently wore this to a party with a pale green silk blouse.,79981,4
79981,I got complements and noticed others looking at it.,79981,4
79981,"It may be ""cheap jewelry"" but it sure look GOOD!",79981,4
79981,My real pearls would not have looked better.,79981,4
79981,Think I'll order the bracelet.,79981,4
79982,"Cute, but low quality.",79982,4
79982,Took a long time to get here.,79982,4
79983,I love this soooooo much and was very excited to get it in the mail after waiting a long time for the shipping... but the cups on the top are too small.. :/ I have to loosen the strings a bit to adjust and it works better.,79983,4
79983,"Girls, maybe don't get this if your bra cup size is a DD or larger.",79983,4
79983,"I am a DDD and I have a lot of trouble fitting into the top of this, other than that it looks really great on me and everything fits great.",79983,4
79983,The strings adjust so I can tie them tighter on the bottom piece so they fit...The only problem for me is always the top piece!!,79983,4
79983,"D: The design of the pot leaves are just like the picture, love them!",79983,4
79984,I love this jacket.,79984,4
79984,"The fit is great, I ordered a size bigger so I could wear a sweater underneath.",79984,4
79984,"It's a great fit, with or without the sweater.",79984,4
79984,"The hood zips off, which I love.",79984,4
79985,My Grandson loves the sharks!,79985,4
79986,It's a sturdy belt but the buckle scrapes the color off or maybe it chaffing the leather.,79986,4
79987,Excellent quality but way to big.,79987,4
79988,Originally purchased a Large and it was too small.,79988,4
79988,Exchanged for an x-large which fit great.,79988,4
79988,"Didn't like having to pay almost $8 postage to return, but received the exchange in only days from mailing the return.",79988,4
79988,Husband was very happy with purchase.,79988,4
79989,My daughter was so happy that what she wanted for her birthday!,79989,4
79989,"Just a tiny to big but at least she can grow into it
Seems like great quality too",79989,4
79990,Not as clear as details as I would like but for my granddaughter it will work,79990,4
79991,These were very cute and they are good material for the price I think I ordered a size down but they still are a good buy,79991,4
79992,I am 6'0 tall and the dress was long enough!,79992,4
79992,"I have a wider rib cage, so it was very snug trying to zip up, but did zip.",79992,4
79992,Ultimately I returned it because strapless doesn't work well for me- I'm always messing with the top and pulling it up.,79992,4
79993,I love this thing.,79993,4
79993,"I wear it when I go out and get plenty of compliments but it's nice to come home and pull it out, Bc it tickles my nose and upper lip a little.",79993,4
79993,It's been a great way for me to see if I really wanna commit to a piercing like that also!,79993,4
79993,"It's not fine metals or anything but very much worth it,  especially for the price!",79993,4
79994,Quality of product and delivery was fine.,79994,4
79994,Item too small so it was returned and the return process was easy as well.,79994,4
79995,"I bought this waist trainer because I had heard they were awesome, but didn't want to spend too much on one in case I didn't like it.",79995,4
79995,"Well, I love it AND saved money.",79995,4
79995,I only gave 4 out 5 stars because it's a little thicker than I had expected.,79995,4
79995,"It is invisible under clothes, though.",79995,4
79995,Definitely gives you a little more confidence in a tight dress!,79995,4
79996,"Love the color, wide straps, and many pockets!!",79996,4
79996,"One zipper gives me a problem, but its one I won't use much.",79996,4
79996,It IS water resistant!,79996,4
79996,I'm going to order other styles for sure!,79996,4
79997,Came in timely manner but runs way small.,79997,4
79998,I expected this to be smaller due to the reviews but it's true to size.,79998,4
79998,Pleasantly surprised at the quality as typically pleather tends to look way worse but I bit a bullet.,79998,4
79998,Luckily I think all I need to do is use a safety pin to fit instead of retuning and going sizes down.,79998,4
79999,"I'm 5'5"" and 115lbs, this dress comes maybe 1-2inches off the ground when I wear flats.",79999,4
79999,"I bought it for a trip to the Dominican and it was perfect, very light and flowy.",79999,4
79999,I recommend nude undergarments if you are wearing it as a dress (which is how i wore it) but it could also work as a swim cover if you wanted.,79999,4
79999,The seams are not 100% perfect but it was $10 and perfect for a beach resort.,79999,4
79999,Taking it on my next vacation too!,79999,4
80000,I love this ring,80000,4
80001,"Smaller than I thought, except that it is a nice bag.",80001,4
80002,Helps keep my glasses clean and safe when they aren't on my face!,80002,4
80002,"Great design, color and product!",80002,4
80002,And easy to find!,80002,4
80003,This is a nice quality skirt.,80003,4
80003,It is well made and the velcro straps are sturdy.,80003,4
80003,I typically always wear Mediums and I am a size 6 so I ordered the medium in grey.,80003,4
80003,Since it has a strip of velcro to adjust te skirt I wasn't worried about sizing too much.,80003,4
80003,I was surprised to find that I had to use the whole velcro strip with no extra room.,80003,4
80003,"The medium fits, but I should have ordered a size up.",80003,4
80003,It adjusts anyway so might as well!,80003,4
80003,The fiance loves this too.,80003,4
80003,He has been asking me to get a school girl skirt for a few years now and this was the perfect one.,80003,4
80003,My behind is on the bigger side (thank you squats) so the skirt does not actually cover me at all - not that I'm planning wearing it outside the house.,80003,4
80003,If you have been looking for a sexy school girl skirt this is the one!,80003,4
80003,I was lucky enough to receive this skirt at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.,80003,4
80004,My daughter is 5 years old.,80004,4
80004,"Just like when Cinderella first opened the glass slipper box, this is how my daughters eyes gleaned.",80004,4
80004,The picture does little justice to these darling shoes when seen and touched in person.,80004,4
80004,"My little one is a fashionista and wore these shoes to bed, to the sandy beach, in the woodchips and to church...no not all in one day.",80004,4
80004,They fit great on the foot and are true to length and width.,80004,4
80004,The shoes do not rub against the toes and they are long-wearing.,80004,4
80004,Easy to put on independently.,80004,4
80004,Four stars for no arch support.,80004,4
80005,"Very good ""ugly sweater"" for someone who hats wearing actual sweaters.",80005,4
80006,"It's a little smaller than expected but other than that, it looks just like the picture and great material.",80006,4
80007,"The dress is beautiful, by did not fit.",80007,4
80007,I ordered two of them and neither one fit.,80007,4
80007,I do not have a computer to print the label.,80007,4
80007,What do I do?,80007,4
80008,Something I'll wear around the house and running errands - as casual clothing.,80008,4
80008,Size runs a bit large.,80008,4
80008,Could have gone down one size from what I normally wear and still had plenty of room in garment.,80008,4
80008,Still a good purchase considering the price!,80008,4
80008,(Did not shrink after washing/machine drying.),80008,4
80009,nice kids look great.,80009,4
80010,Looks and feels very nice.,80010,4
80010,"I didn't buy it for myself, but for a gift.",80010,4
80010,"It comes in a cheap plastic, which is the only negative to this product, I needed white leather gloves, very limited selection in white on Amazon, and these were priciest out of all, so initial presentation is only 1 star.",80010,4
80010,"They do feel good in hand, not the softest leather, but for under $50, can't complain.",80010,4
80010,"I also ordered another pair for a man, different brand, and much cheaper, came in a very nicely packaged box, and leather feels better, also a lot softer on the inside, but no white option.",80010,4
80010,"They aren't really white, more off white, like ivory color.",80010,4
80010,I still think it's a great buy.,80010,4
80010,"Just wish it came in a better packaging, because now I have to buy a box.",80010,4
80012,"Really love this dress, especially the pockets, but it's way too short for me.",80012,4
80013,"I enjoyed the two shirts, and I thank you for thrm.",80013,4
80013,The sizing chart for me from Chinese sizes to western sizes was accurate for me.,80013,4
80013,"I was a bit surprised they were larges, and was internally curious how small a small was if a large in Chinese sizes fits small american.",80013,4
80013,Just envious is all.,80013,4
80013,"But mine fit very well, a couple eyelets will need to be worked over again, as there were a couple loose threads, however, that's the only negative thing I could sat about them.",80013,4
80013,"They wash well, the sizes don't change after being washed, and my husband thinks they look real sharp when I wear them.",80013,4
80014,Really cute for a young girl.,80014,4
80014,Gave it to my granddaughter for Easter.,80014,4
80014,She is 8 and love it.,80014,4
80015,NIce suit but the cup size is very small.,80015,4
80017,great color to the stones.,80017,4
80018,Lots of tuxedo shirts are thin and almost see through.,80018,4
80018,They are made of synthetics that can be uncomfortable.,80018,4
80018,This shirt is all cotton and is pretty beefy.,80018,4
80018,"The shirt is built to last, and is more of a commercial grade tuxedo shirt.",80018,4
80018,Very heavy weight cotton.,80018,4
80018,It also has a lot of room in the chest and torso.,80018,4
80018,"If you are a bigger guy who wants room in his shirt, then this is a good option for you.",80018,4
80018,This is not an athletic or slim fit shirt.,80018,4
80018,"If you are slimmer, you may want to consider another option unless the roominess of the shirt doesn't bother you.",80018,4
80018,"If you wear the shirt with a vest, the roominess of the shirt is not as noticeable.",80018,4
80018,You will want to get the shirt cleaned and pressed before wearing it because it is all cotton and pretty beefy.,80018,4
80018,"For the money, it is a very good quality shirt, just beware because it is on the roomy side.",80018,4
80019,Was my fault - I wanted sweatpants with pockets and assumed they all came that way,80019,4
80020,"Love it,  except is a little too big.",80020,4
80021,Great product and well made.,80021,4
80022,fits me just perfect..,80022,4
80025,It was 100/100 polyester.,80025,4
80025,I thought it's must be mixed (cotton) and other fabric.,80025,4
80025,It's not bad anyway!,80025,4
80026,"Very nice,  but by the sizing chart i purchased the XL and is a bit large on me.",80026,4
80028,Thin material and unforgiving.,80028,4
80028,I bought a large ( I'm a 12 ) it was very loose.,80028,4
80028,I think a medium would have looked better but after doing some altering it's perfect,80028,4
80029,"The bathing suit was cute, but the seller needs to offer picking different sizes for each piece.",80029,4
80029,What fit my hips did not even begin to cover my chest.,80029,4
80031,It's a bit big around the bust and shoulders but can be easily but I'm also 6months pregnant but usually wear an extra small so my whole build and frame is small up top.,80031,4
80031,"Right now I'm a 34 d cup so also not that big in the bust either, other than that it fit perfectly!",80031,4
80031,Had a ton of complements on it at the wedding I wore it too,80031,4
80032,"Fits as expected for size, really cute on.",80032,4
80032,I purchased this so that I could be covered up and still enjoy outdoor water activities.,80032,4
80034,"Nice bag, not the best fabric quality",80034,4
80036,It is a very cheap watch so expect cheap material.,80036,4
80036,So don't be surprised when the band start to wear on you.,80036,4
80036,Other than that it's a good watch and you can get the band replaced for a higher quality one that could last longer.,80036,4
80037,Has a minor hole near the seam.,80037,4
80037,Fits good and feels nice.,80037,4
80038,"The pants are very long, but the print is super cute.",80038,4
80039,Loved it came on time but sizing runs bigger,80039,4
80040,"It is a bit see through, but super cute for a beach cover up or if you wear a slip underneath",80040,4
80041,"I love the concept, but....the case itself is junk.",80041,4
80041,I've had it for three months and the edges are cracking and flaking off.,80041,4
80041,The glasses are great.,80041,4
80041,"I use them all the time, I just wish the case was not crumbling off.",80041,4
80041,"It has never been dropped or anything to damage it physically, it just sits in my pocket.",80041,4
80042,Well made stays in place.,80042,4
80043,"Cute shirt, runs a little big.",80043,4
80043,I am 5' 115 lbs.,80043,4
80043,"it fits a little loose everywhere, but I can still wear it.",80043,4
80043,It's just a little larger than I expected,80043,4
80044,"The shoes are very pretty and the size is as expected, but not for wide feet.",80044,4
80044,Unfortunately I had to return them since my daughter's feet were a bit too side for them and gave her some pain wearing them.,80044,4
80045,Colors pretty for this scarf.,80045,4
80045,Plan to use it travelling.,80045,4
80045,"Big enough to hold my Samsung 5 and a bit larger phone, passport, and a couple other things.",80045,4
80045,"One issue is the zipper - it's black and obvious, not great for a ""hidden"" compartment.",80045,4
80045,But the scarf is attractive and usable.,80045,4
80046,Smelled a lil weird when I received it but other than that it was fine,80046,4
80047,I purchased this suit despite being a bit worried about what the fit would be.,80047,4
80047,I am 5'2 about 145 lbs size 36 D bra.,80047,4
80047,Overall the suit fit well.,80047,4
80047,The bottoms were a tiny bit large on me but there is no way a medium top would have fit me.,80047,4
80047,The bottoms dip loooow in the front.,80047,4
80047,So no 1970's bush if you plan on wearing this.,80047,4
80047,It covers the backside very well though.,80047,4
80047,I like the bra-like support the top gives and even though the cups are a bit small the black part that ties around your neck adds coverage and support too.,80047,4
80047,The bra cups are padded and not see through.,80047,4
80047,It took about 10 days to get to me from China.,80047,4
80047,Overall well made suit.,80047,4
80047,I'm adding a pic to show I am not some super skinny or super buff person.,80047,4
80048,"The top is super cute, and fit as expected for the most part.",80048,4
80048,"I'm keeping this suit for the top only, and will have to replace the bottoms or lose a ton of weight.",80048,4
80048,"The bottoms were definitely smaller that expected, but still cute if you can fit into the top and small bottoms.",80048,4
80049,Sleeves were long but fitted real good,80049,4
80051,"This was a beautiful skirt, but very small.",80051,4
80051,"The size chart doesn't apply to US size, I went two sizes big to be sure and it fit four sizes small!!!",80051,4
80051,Didn't want to go thru the trouble of returning it so I gave it away.,80051,4
80051,Too bad...lovely skirt though.,80051,4
80052,This my 2nd Grace Karin dress.,80052,4
80052,Love my first dress a bit more because it is sleeveless and felt more roomy in the shoulders than this one.,80052,4
80052,Material has a very little bit of stretch but nice fabric.,80052,4
80052,I am 5'3 125lbs and a 34 dd bust 28 inch waist.,80052,4
80052,I bought a dark blue polka dotted medium.,80052,4
80052,The top is fitted but not hard to zip.,80052,4
80052,I just have to wear an unpadded bra and the fit is perfect.,80052,4
80052,The waist is not tight at all.,80052,4
80052,It comes to the bottom of my knee when standing.,80052,4
80052,Very pretty and perfect for church.,80052,4
80052,I wear a regular slip underneath.,80052,4
80052,AZ summer too hot for anything else.,80052,4
80053,"Happy with the design and quality, would buy again.",80053,4
80055,I love the design of these socks.,80055,4
80055,"I mean really, who doesn't want sumo wrestlers on their feet?",80055,4
80055,The socks are also not too thin and comfortable to wear.,80055,4
80055,My one complaint is that the toes wear out a little too quickly.,80055,4
80055,I'm on my second pair and each probably only lasted for a couple dozen wearings before one of the toes started to give out.,80055,4
80057,"First let me say that I was a bit nervous to buy this at first because it was coming from China, however, I am truly satisfied!",80057,4
80057,I am 5'3 145lbs and I ordered a large.,80057,4
80057,I would recommend that curvy girls go up a size.,80057,4
80057,It was a bit snugg but overly cute!,80057,4
80059,"I love the outfit, but it come small, so get an extra size up,",80059,4
80060,"I purchased these to help with a neuroma I have in my foot (basically a bundle of nerves in my toes that get really, really sore from wearing closed toed shoes or walking a lot).",80060,4
80060,They were AMAZING for this and I had absolutely zero neuroma pain after walking about 8 hours on cobblestone streets in Florence.,80060,4
80060,"However, they are a little bit thick and I did have a ton of pain from the multiple gigantic blisters that resulted from my feet rubbing against the tops of my shoes, an issue I have never had with the shoes I was wearing before.",80060,4
80060,"I don't think these are any thicker than most insoles, so it may be a bit unfair to dock a star for this, but I ended up pulling them out discreetly on a side street when I could barely walk from the blisters and tossed them in a garbage can.",80060,4
80061,"I love the look and fit of this shirt, except that it is REALLY SHORT on me.",80061,4
80061,"I am tall (5'10"") but I didn't think it would fit me like a crop top.",80061,4
80061,"I have to wear it with high-waist yoga pants, but it still looks super cute and shows off my cute sports bras, which is what I bought it for.",80061,4
80062,Is identical to picture.,80062,4
80062,"Have not washed yet to see if it maintains bright colors, but overall satisfied!",80062,4
80063,"Real leather belt is great, but I ordered a large and it is too big.",80063,4
80063,"I had to add a hole, not easy to do as this is a fairly thick leather.",80063,4
80063,"Love that I can change the buckle, and the quality is very nice.",80063,4
80064,Fun dress for comic con.,80064,4
80065,"The top is comfy and fits, but I feel like it's going to slide to the side and expose me.",80065,4
80065,Perhaps it was just made for a bigger bust than mine.,80065,4
80065,The bottoms are perfect.,80065,4
80065,All in all it looks and feels great.,80065,4
80066,"Very warm, it fit very well, very happy with my purchase!",80066,4
80067,"Nice shirt, seems to be well made.",80067,4
80068,It's rather a nice hand chain however I find it somewhat bigger than my hands.,80068,4
80068,My hand size is normal not big or small.,80068,4
80069,Its a tad on the large side but ut is so gorgeous.,80069,4
80069,I always get compliments,80069,4
80072,Nice fit and comfortable.,80072,4
80073,"A bit sheer, but fun to wear.",80073,4
80073,Good for hiding those bulges that we don't always love to emphasize.,80073,4
80074,I made America great again just by buying this hat.,80074,4
80075,Very nice; just like the picture,80075,4
80076,I like the dress.,80076,4
80076,I'm 6'0 220 and the fit was nice not tight but I wish it was a little longer it hits at the knee.,80076,4
80077,"This is great with leggings, just what I was hoping for when I ordered it.",80077,4
80077,"I'm 5'5"" and it comes about mid thigh in the front and a little past my hips on the side.",80077,4
80077,It's also really soft.,80077,4
80079,"According to the size chart I would have fell somewhere between an XS and a S. Since there wasn't XS to choose from the drop down field, I ordered the small.",80079,4
80079,"I'm 5'0"", 115lbs, bra size 34A, and I think a 2 in pant size.",80079,4
80079,The top fit okay but I would have preferred it to be a little smaller.,80079,4
80079,I would be afraid to jump in the water for fear the top would slide up.,80079,4
80079,The bottom was too tight around the hips where my pudge looked like it was being pushed out like play-doh and the width of the crotch was too wide to the point I felt like I wouldn't feel comfortable sitting with my legs together.,80079,4
80079,"Sadly, I will be returning this item today.",80079,4
80080,"nice wallet but little bit to big for me
to fit in front pocket.",80080,4
80080,"it doe's fit in
front pocket just a little bit to bulky
for me.",80080,4
80081,But its too wide.,80081,4
80081,Still use it though.,80081,4
80082,Cloth is so nice and washable but it's not suitable for big buttocks ladies.,80082,4
80083,"soooo, the top is super cute, I am defiantly wearing it to my next festival.",80083,4
80083,I'm a 36B and it fits me pretty well.,80083,4
80083,The top stops at the edge of my boobs.,80083,4
80083,It is also a little see through.,80083,4
80083,The only problem I have with it is putting it on.,80083,4
80083,The sting you use to tie the back together came fetched from the top itself and you have to lace it in to get the top on.,80083,4
80083,Took me a little while but overall great top.,80083,4
80084,"Wear a  woman's shoe size 6, fits perfect, nice thick bottoms, very comfortable.",80084,4
80085,I love this boots my only complain is that they are hard to keep on.,80085,4
80086,"They were cute but I didn't realize that even though my search was for shirts ""large"" size that this came up anyway.",80086,4
80086,"Wish I could wear them, but just looking that they were size small I knew I couldn't wear them.",80086,4
80086,they sent me a prepaid label & took them back.,80086,4
80087,These are very simple bow headbands.,80087,4
80087,Nothing fancy but are still cute.,80087,4
80087,"The do tend to slip because there isn't rubber or anything in there to prevent it, but you get what you pay for.",80087,4
80087,"my 11-month old did rip off one of the bows, it looks like it's either lightly glued on or has a single stitch because it came off very easily.",80087,4
80087,But I still have several other colors and they are good for the price.,80087,4
80088,The mask itself is pretty good but the only downside is the eyeholes are cut in such a weird way to where they will either be too far up or too low.,80088,4
80089,I feel comfortable in it and I've gotten tons of compliments,80089,4
80091,"very nice, I'm thick down bottom so I had concerns, I usually wear anywhere from a 9-13 depending on the cut and type of pants, but these fit me fine, not thin material like I expected.",80091,4
80091,"I also have pretty thick thighs and was worried, but it's fine.",80091,4
80091,"It had a very sturdy waist band and the color looked nice, I do wish I came just a little bit bigger so I could have it loose a little around the crotch but it's not constricting.",80091,4
80091,"Not see through for me, but if you wear anything from 15 on up you might wanna re-think buying these

Good buy :)",80091,4
80092,These earrings are very pretty!,80092,4
80092,I have long hair so being on the larger size they can be easily seen when I'm wearing them.,80092,4
80092,"Given the material they are made out of, they are on the heavier side but they are not too heavy and don't pull my ear lobe down, but I do know I'm are wearing an earing.",80092,4
80092,I'm pleased with the purchase and would recommend.,80092,4
80093,These high waisted fleece leggings are just the ticket for cold winters.,80093,4
80093,I wear skirts and boots almost every day and the different colors although subtle keep my wardrobe from getting to predictable.,80093,4
80093,I ordered two sizes larger because I can't stand the muffin top I get from a too tight thin waist band.,80093,4
80093,I honestly look slimmer in the larger size.,80093,4
80094,"very good fit and I am 6' 3"".",80094,4
80095,"I loved this dress, I used it for lingerie though!",80095,4
80096,the quality is ok. i got what i expected for the price,80096,4
80097,This is a nice lightweight hoodie that pairs nicely with leggings or yoga pants.,80097,4
80097,Comfortable if you have a bootie and are looking for something long go a size up,80097,4
80098,Happy with the dress.,80098,4
80098,"Very nice, vivid colors.",80098,4
80098,A little heavy for summer wear.,80098,4
80099,"I went with the advice from other reviews to go a couple sizes up and am pleased with the fit overall, except I would like a bit more room in the chest area.",80099,4
80099,"The panels above the faux pockets, wrinkle a bit on me.",80099,4
80099,Perhaps a half size larger for me would have been a perfect fit.,80099,4
80099,But overall I like it alot.,80099,4
80099,I will wear it with the sleeves pushed up.,80099,4
80100,It's shorter than the picture shows.,80100,4
80100,I am size 4 and it fits perfectly.,80100,4
80100,Finishing could be better as there was lot of threads hanging.,80100,4
80101,great choice for a swim shirt for me as it is more body fitting,80101,4
80102,This is very comfortable.,80102,4
80102,"It is very fitted around chest, but flares nicely around waist.",80102,4
80102,Can be dressed up easily.,80102,4
80103,"I'm 5'4"" 140 lbs (I consider myself petite) and I ordered a large based on previous reviews and it fits perfectly.",80103,4
80103,"There were a few strings here and there that needed to be trimmed off, but other than than it's great.",80103,4
80103,The length of the shirt is long enough to wear with leggings and the sleeves look very pretty.,80103,4
80103,"If there were more colors, I'd order them too.",80103,4
80104,If you buy your actual size the dress will fit comfortably.,80104,4
80106,Please with my order,80106,4
80107,I sent it back for the next size up.,80107,4
80107,"I ordered a M which I usually wear, but it was a bit snug so I ordered a large.",80107,4
80107,Still waiting for that one.,80107,4
80108,Very cute dress  as long as you don't mind it being very very short,80108,4
80109,This was a gift for my friend and she liked it very much.,80109,4
80110,"color is dark pink, not as shown",80110,4
80111,Pendant looks better than photo graded but smaller than expected.,80111,4
80111,It should be modeled.,80111,4
80113,I ordered a 4xxx and the top part to me could have been just a tad bit bigger.,80113,4
80113,The shipping was fast,80113,4
80116,"dress it up or dress it down, wear a black tank underneath.",80116,4
80118,Love the fit and the fabric is light and perfect for summer.,80118,4
80119,"Ordered a medium, wear a size medium t shirt normally.",80119,4
80120,I was hoping this dress would fit.... it is tight in the hips.,80120,4
80120,Order 2 sizes up.,80120,4
80120,I love the sleeves.,80120,4
80121,Great except they snag fairly easily in the crotch area.,80121,4
80121,Seems like that's the case with most leggings.,80121,4
80121,These are nice because they're not see through though!,80121,4
80122,Although it was smaller than I expected it is an absolutely gorgeous shirt.,80122,4
80122,One flow was the fact that none of this seems were trimmed I had to do that on manually myself.,80122,4
80122,But for the price I cannot complain at all.,80122,4
80122,"Wash by hand though if you do buy the shirt, precaution to loosely threaded materials.",80122,4
80123,My daughter has a long torso and a penchant for waving her arms so her belly always gets exposed.,80123,4
80123,"I bought this at a 5T for her not quite 5 year old body and it's warm, soft, and covers all her bits.",80123,4
80123,She is smitten with adorable Peppa and very happy when it cycles into her week for wear.,80123,4
80124,Love this top for the price!,80124,4
80124,Order a size or two up tho.,80124,4
80124,I'm 5'6 140lbs DD and I normally wear a medium or large.,80124,4
80124,I got a large and it fits but I would like it better if it was a little longer.,80124,4
80124,Should've got the xl.,80124,4
80124,You have to lace it up yourself.,80124,4
80124,Still really happy with it.,80124,4
80125,It was a little bigger than i thought.,80125,4
80125,"However, it was worth the price and looks exactly as depicted.",80125,4
80126,Shirt very cute but run small,80126,4
80127,Little more baggy than I expected but other than that they are very comfortable.,80127,4
80129,Awesome came super fast great fit.,80129,4
80129,One problem they give a little camel toe I'd suggest a size up and don't get the bright colors they suck.,80129,4
80129,Get the space dye ones.,80129,4
80130,"These were cute bracelets and my Harry Potter loving friend loved them but, I found that the packaging and bracelets had a musty smell to them like they've been sitting in a cardboard box for a long time through dampness and changes in temperature.",80130,4
80130,The bracelets weren't ruined in any way except there was a smell.,80130,4
80130,Still cute for Harry Potter peeps.,80130,4
80131,"Zippers jam a little, but for the price this little bag is roomy and perfect for travel",80131,4

80133,Size and durability are great.,80133,4
80133,"I don't like the drawstring system much, but maybe thats just me",80133,4
80134,They are helping with my issues so great.,80134,4
80135,"This said order a size up and I did and it is still too small in the process of shipping the item back for my refund, on the other hand the material is very strong and durable my advice if you wear a medium go for the xlarge or 2X",80135,4
80136,"the brown side is much darker than it looks in the photos, so much so that it's barely discernible from the black side.",80136,4
80136,overall a gorgeous well-made belt for the price.,80136,4
80137,I'm not sure why this didn't click but this is a spandex shirt.,80137,4
80137,I thought it was a cotton shirt.,80137,4
80137,It hangs like spandex so it is very slippery.,80137,4
80137,I am a little concerned it will pill but it hasn't yet.,80137,4
80137,I think the model is a little odd - I mean if i wore spandex with a cotton flannel i think it might look a little odd.,80137,4
80137,I'm from the 90's!,80137,4
80137,I should know what you can and can't wear with flannel.,80137,4
80138,"The dress fit as expected, I wear between and 10 and 12 so I ordered a 12.",80138,4
80138,"I'm only 5' 0"" so I knew it would be long but was easily hemmed.",80138,4
80138,"The quality was pretty good for the price, there were minor touch ups I had to do on some of the embroidery.",80138,4
80138,"Overall, it was a nice dress.",80138,4
80139,"very cute, but i thought they were going to be made of metal.",80139,4
80139,"They turned out to be plastic, but hey, great quality for the price!",80139,4
80141,keeps me warm in and out doors overall good buy,80141,4
80142,This looks very sexy on.,80142,4
80142,"I like the slits on the top for the nipples, it adds an extra sexy flare.",80142,4
80142,"The only thing I don't like about the top is that it ties in the back like a swimsuit and sits high on your back and if your smaller breasted like me, and A-B cup, then the front of the top is hard to keep down, it rides up a little if you move too much.",80142,4
80142,The bottoms fit me perfect but my butt is a little bigger than the girl in the picture.,80142,4
80142,"I have not tried to use the garters with actual tights yet but those as well fit around my hips, also these DID come with the thigh highs, I didn't like those too much however, I found them to be too tight, overall for price I enjoy this and I know my man will too when I get to show him!",80142,4
80143,They are see through,80143,4
80144,"The pearl and crystal beads are wonderful, but the charms look a bit cheaper than the beads--which is unfortunate.",80144,4
80144,"It's also kind of an awkward length to wear as a wrap bracelet, which is why I wanted it.",80144,4
80144,It can still be worn that way but it's quite tight.,80144,4
80145,"I am 5'2"" 140 pounds and just had a breast reduction.",80145,4
80145,Before my surgery I was a DD/DDD cup and now I'm probably around a C cup.,80145,4
80145,"After reading reviews I ordered XL although I think a Large would have been great, but I'd be worried about the band because this one is already snug.",80145,4
80145,The band under the bust on this XL seems to fit like a Small/Medium while the top portion and straps fit similar to my Large sports bras.,80145,4
80145,I think if I was still a DD/DDD cup I would love this sports bra even more.,80145,4
80145,It's definitely a good one if you have a smaller ribcage / small frame with a large chest.,80145,4
80145,I cannot see this working for anyone over 36-38 bra band size.,80145,4
80146,I get tons of compliments on these booties!,80146,4
80146,They are true to size and comfortable to wear all day.,80146,4
80146,"The zipper is stiff, as other reviewers have mentioned, but not impossible to use.",80146,4
80146,GREAT for the price.,80146,4
80146,"Similar looking shoes cost twice as much, which makes me wonder about the durability, but so far, so good!",80146,4
80147,Yes it met it met my expetions.,80147,4
80148,Looks like it wouldn't fit but it stretches.,80148,4
80149,Looks and fits exactly as pictured,80149,4
80150,Nice fit and nice soft t-shirt.,80150,4
80151,This is a very sexy dress.,80151,4
80151,It does not fit like the picture.,80151,4
80151,"I would have went a size larger, but the designer did such a fine job, the dress hugs my curves in the right place and really shows off my sexy legs.",80151,4
80151,I wore this dress with some stiletto pumps to accentuate my legs.,80151,4
80153,I usually a 16 I ordered a 3X and it fits perfect.,80153,4
80153,"I am one to never wear girdles because of how uncomfortable they are, however, this one is much more comfortable then ones I previously tried to wear.",80153,4
80153,It does not fit to tight or to loose.,80153,4
80153,It holds the stomach in a little and lifts the booTAY...,80153,4
80154,I wore this belly band every day throughout the first part of my pregnancy - until I could fit into maternity jeans.,80154,4
80154,Stayed up great - I never had any issues with it rolling up or down.,80154,4
80154,It held my pants up great as well.,80154,4
80156,The red star on the headband was rubbing off.,80156,4
80156,"Otherwise, fit/looked as expected.",80156,4
80158,Quality is very good put giving it four stars because of the top size is little big.,80158,4
80159,I like it and will probably order 1 size up.,80159,4
80159,I did in another color and I like fit better,80159,4
80160,"I usually wear a size small-medium but because it's Asian size I went with a large, it's not as long as in the pictures though, so if you want it that long I think a xl might work, but I still think it's cute and I'll definitely wear it.",80160,4
80160,order 1-2 sizes up than normally and you should be fine!,80160,4
80160,"also it came way earlier than expected, like 2 weeks early which is nice :-)",80160,4
80161,"Took a bit to figure out how to get into it, but it looks great!",80161,4
80161,Definitely too low-cut to wear without a bra underneath or pasties at a minimum - otherwise it's a sure recipe for a wardrobe malfunction.,80161,4
80161,"Only frustration I have with it is the slippery fabric of the hood falling down or out of place and taking a bit to rearrange, but that's a minor nuisance only.",80161,4
80162,I was a little hesitant about this dress.,80162,4
80162,"I love the look of it, but it seemed like so many of the reviews had really different thoughts on sizing.",80162,4
80162,Here's what I can say about my purchase....,80162,4
80162,"I am 5'5"" and typically wear a size medium or size 8.",80162,4
80162,I did order this dress in a large just to be on the safe side with the width and the length of the dress.,80162,4
80162,I could have honestly ordered a medium and think it would've been fine.,80162,4
80162,I felt a little frumpy with the dress as is (probably because it felt kind of big on me) so I put a 2 inch brown braided belt with it and brown sandals.,80162,4
80162,My boyfriend loved it.,80162,4
80162,Said it was so sexy!,80162,4
80162,It was very cool and comfortable feeling.,80162,4
80162,I hope that it washes well.,80162,4
80162,"It was long enough, even with a belt on to wear it as a dress for me.",80162,4
80163,It is a lovely tie.,80163,4
80164,"Very cute top but bought for me & gave to my daughter, too small.",80164,4
80165,Arrived on time and was quite pleased with the quality.,80165,4
80166,"Very cute and soft but when I bought the item it said it was Carter's brand and when It came it came with a fake Carter's tag on the inside and a tag with Chinese writing on the outside
I love the sweatshirt but it wasn't Carter's",80166,4
80167,"As one reviewer wrote, this is only one boot stretcher, do that only one boot can be stretched at a time.",80167,4
80167,"Even considering that and the cost, my husband is happy with it.",80167,4
80167,Perhaps because I'm the one who paid for it.,80167,4
80167,"He wears cowboy style boots daily, and after using this stretcher, can now take them on and off comfortably.",80167,4
80167,That makes him happy.,80167,4
80167,That he no longer needs my help removing his boots at the end of the day makes me happy.,80167,4
80167,Bottom line: we are ultimately both happy with the purchase.,80167,4
80167,I did subtract one point for the cost/value considering only one boot can be done at a time.,80167,4
80167,"My husband was more forgiving, but it was his feet and my money.",80167,4
80169,Great quality and super cute.,80169,4
80169,The only thing is the strap.,80169,4
80169,"The strap it comes with has plastic clasps and is pretty fragile, but if you buy a replacement chain it's excellent!",80169,4
80170,"This product arrived on time, And it's a great price.",80170,4
80172,Very pretty and made nicely!,80172,4
80173,I am 120 lb 5'4''.,80173,4
80173,I got a medium and it was too big but it's super cute!,80173,4
80174,Came in a very timely manner.,80174,4
80174,I'm happy I ordered a size up as it would not have fit my daughter.,80174,4
80174,She is beyond thrilled ans cannot wait to wear it for Prom.,80174,4
80175,"They were a nice quality and exactly what I was looking for, but they were too big in accordance to the age they were supposed to fit.",80175,4
80176,Took some time to break in.,80176,4
80176,The laces come loose due to material and shape.,80176,4
80176,"Overall, pleased with this purchase.",80176,4
80177,Nice fit looks great,80177,4
80178,"Only con, some of the pins break off...I might just be rough on brooches tho?",80178,4
80179,These are great for someone that needs large arch support,80179,4
80180,ok b ut a strange fit,80180,4
80181,"Even though I wouldn't expect this Sundress to be fitted, the body is larger and longer than I would like!",80181,4
80184,I ordered 2 sizes up and it for well like the picture.,80184,4
80184,My complaint is the neckline is a bit small for the size but it wasn't like I couldn't fit it over my head.,80184,4
80184,All in all satisfactory if you order a couple of sizes up.,80184,4
80185,Good quality at a reasonable price.,80185,4
80186,Read other reviews so I ordered a little bigger then his size.,80186,4
80187,Nice shirt made of soft fabric but skimpy in coverage of you are busty even a bit.,80187,4
80188,I like this ring.,80188,4
80188,Its like a real diamond.,80188,4
80189,It is see through.,80189,4
80190,Have same style in a size 4 and the size 5 seems to be quite a jump up so have to wait a little bit for him to be able to wear them but super easy to put on and stay on!,80190,4
80190,Have gotten lots of compliments!,80190,4
80191,"A bit snug on the hips, but pretty dress",80191,4
80192,Seems to be  very nice - not used yet as it is to be a Christmas present for a nephew.,80192,4
80193,Its better than I thought.,80193,4
80193,Do you have a little smaller size in the same shape...,80193,4
80195,It's really boxy fitting.,80195,4
80195,Not much for the figure.,80195,4
80195,The material is great tho,80195,4
80196,Perfect fit EXCEPT the sleeves.,80196,4
80196,All these large men were getting shirts so i had no review to go off of.,80196,4
80196,"I am 5'7, 130 lbs.",80196,4
80196,Shirt fits perfectly EXCEPT the sleeve cuffs - they're so tight i can barely get them over my hand.,80196,4
80196,"I'll be cutting them and sewing on a button, but overall it's the perfect fit.",80196,4
80196,"If you can attach a button or something, by all means it's true to size.",80196,4
80197,Very cute and comfortable outfit.,80197,4
80197,Our 2 month old wore it for his newborn photos and it was a hit.,80197,4
80197,The only disappointment was that one the the ears started falling apart after wearing it 2x.,80197,4
80199,Material a bit rough  on skin,80199,4
80200,"Bought these for my girlfriend, the fabric is a little cheap, but the design is every bit as cool as it looks on the web.",80200,4
80201,Just what i expected,80201,4
80204,"Looks nice, washed well (cold water wash on delicate, laid flat to dry on drying rack).",80204,4
80204,"My daughter likes it, though I wish it were warmer for her (she cares more about looks than being warm); I'm glad it has a hood.",80204,4
80204,"I can't remember what size I ordered, but I think it will show up on the review.",80204,4
80204,"It fits her well, she is 5' tall and around 90 lbs.",80204,4
80205,The only problem is trying to dig out coins from the coin/zippered part.,80205,4
80205,"It's so narrow that if you have ANY credit cards in the inside slots, it pushes too much into the coin holder part and makes it a VERY tight squeeze..",80205,4
80205,"If they made this with a little more room, it would be perfect.",80205,4
80206,Bought scrub sets for my husband.,80206,4
80206,He is being treated for cancer and finds scrubs comfortable for the treatment session.,80206,4
80206,"I thought there was some elastic in the waist along with the drawstring, but, it was all drawstring.",80206,4
80206,He could comfortably fit in a medium-but asked for large to ensure comfort.,80206,4
80206,"They're just a little too large--but, not the fault of the company.",80206,4
80206,"Again, thank you Amazon for having everything I need.",80206,4
80207,I bought this to wear as a guest at a wedding.,80207,4
80207,I received a few compliments on it.,80207,4
80207,My only complaint is the belt/buckle on the back doesn't stay where you need it.,80207,4
80207,"I just used a safety pin on the underside of the belt, and it was perfect.",80207,4
80207,So I wouldn't let that keep you from buying it.,80207,4
80207,It's a beautiful print and very comfortable to wear.,80207,4
80209,"I like how it fits, and material",80209,4
80210,No problems with this at all.,80210,4
80210,"I bought this to make a tshirt dress and so it was just the right amount of extra material, allowing room to work with.",80210,4
80210,"If I bought this to wear as is, by the size you would wear in a shirt so as not to make you look pregnant.",80210,4
80210,Overall cute to pair with leggings just with boots.,80210,4
80211,The picture doesn't do it justice.,80211,4
80211,"This dress is adorable in person although it runs rather large, with longer arms than other dresses of similar size.",80211,4
80212,"With a 32"" inseam these stocking/Sox hit barely above the knee.",80212,4
80212,"The top elastic was initially tight but after wearing them for the day, there isn't the telltale marks I had expected.",80212,4
80212,All my gfs ask where I got them.,80212,4
80212,I highly recommend these for those that don't sport leggings or tights well.,80212,4
80212,I'm shopping for more colors and pattern to jazz up my ensembles.,80212,4
80213,"Well made, good for sun protection.",80213,4
80213,"We bought two just before the trip to Disney World and everyone took turns wearing them (two adults, two kids under age 9).",80213,4
80213,They fit all of us.,80213,4
80213,"The canvas is quite thick, which means the top doesn't breathe well, so on hot, humid, sunny days these kept us feeling warmer than we wanted to be.",80213,4
80213,"But on the pouring down rainy days, they kept our heads dry.",80213,4
80214,I was looking for mini wallet so it is bigger than I imagined but I did not read product description.,80214,4
80214,I got fusia color and it is beutiful.,80214,4
80215,"Nice fit , good looks",80215,4
80216,It fits comfortably and looks so real!,80216,4
80217,"Definitely has a silk feel, very pretty.",80217,4
80217,Would go a size up.,80217,4
80217,Fits but not loose.,80217,4
80218,"Very comfortable, and really cute.",80218,4
80219,They are great .,80219,4
80219,I just had to order 2 sizes bigger,80219,4
80220,Felt really soft & fit perfectly,80220,4
80221,"This belt is shiny silver, and my impression was black with silver hilights.",80221,4
80221,Not bad quality overall.,80221,4
80221,"It is nice as a decorative piece, but not suited to heavy use.",80221,4
80223,The fit is perfect,80223,4
80225,"Fits nicely, just not quite as soft as I was hoping.",80225,4
80226,"It's beautiful, a bit tight around the breast area, very nice material... highly recommended",80226,4
80227,Arrived earlier than expected.,80227,4
80227,Is a little cheaply made but all in all a good product.,80227,4
80228,"Cute, but the lace on the edges is rough and itchy.",80228,4
80228,I just cut mine off .,80228,4
80228,"Great price, worth it to buy.",80228,4
80229,nice comfortable fit and kind of a sexy feel about it.,80229,4
80229,The buttons give it a somewhat dressy tank shirt to it.,80229,4
80230,Nice basic tank top.,80230,4
80230,It fits as expected and fabric seems to be solid.,80230,4
80230,Not too thin and not to thick.,80230,4
80230,"Breaths well, and arm holes are not too big and gaping like other tanks are, where you might as well not have one on.",80230,4
80231,The mask was great other than the fact that it's eye holes were too low and the mask was very big for the average head size.,80231,4
80231,I got the latex smell out by throwing it in the washing machine for a cycle.,80231,4
80231,I wore it around Target and it got lots of attention!,80231,4
80233,"It's a little bit larger (wider), but for the price it still looks great.",80233,4
80233,I wear it over a tank top or my swim suit Bc it is thin material and a bit sheer.,80233,4
80233,"Looks nice with a belt too, for a more fitted look.",80233,4
80234,Nice material and great natural coloring.,80234,4
80234,I am giving it four stars because it does run a little small.,80234,4
80234,"I have a small head for a woman, but this was even snug for me.",80234,4
80234,"It will do, but it would have be nicer had it been a bit larger.",80234,4
80235,Overall I like this shirt and think it is going to work great for the skirt I bought it for that still hasn't come in.,80235,4
80235,"My only complaint is the shirt is a little bigger on me than I expected, but I am also very small with narrow shoulders.",80235,4
80235,Either way it looks exactly like it does in the picture.,80235,4
80235,I ordered the small in white.,80235,4
80235,My normal size is US2- XS  and my measurements are 33-25-35 if that helps for reference.,80235,4
80236,Like the two currency pockets and the ability to store a few credit cards.,80236,4
80237,"A very pretty bracelet, but it didn't match the dress I was planning to wear it with.",80237,4
80237,"I haven't worn it yet, but I still really like it.",80237,4
80238,"A simple, sexy top.",80238,4
80238,Add leggings or strappy sandals for styling.,80238,4
80238,The material is polyester and easy to wash.,80238,4
80239,Very good quality very happy with the pricing.,80239,4
80240,"I love the jacket , it runs just a little bit small, I should have ordered the next size up",80240,4
80241,This was a gift...the recipient loves it.,80241,4
80242,Nice color and heft,80242,4
80243,I think it runs small but I haven't returned.,80243,4
80243,Looks like it will really show off my too smoke curves.,80243,4
80245,love this skirt true to color amazing fit the only thing is the slit came up a little high I plan on fixing that but if you don't have any sewing skills or access to a seamstress do as little bending as possible,80245,4
80246,"But I don't recommend for long torsos, luckily for me it was just right",80246,4
80248,Sold by Amazon seller 'Movesway'.,80248,4
80248,"This was shipped in a box so it arrived unscathed/uncrushed, unlike the white one I ordered (from Amazon seller Sweetie Sugar, which arrived crushed in a soft padded envelope).",80248,4
80248,"I ordered a Large, and it fit as expected.",80248,4
80248,"Listed as black, but it's more of a dark, charcoal grey.",80248,4
80248,"Make no mistake, this isn't a high end hat, but is actually a little bit nicer than the white one i got (never mind that it was crushed), in the sash band around the exterior, and slightly softer headband.",80248,4
80248,Definitely worth the $10 shipped from China anyways.,80248,4
80250,"Very comfortable, but I wish the neck had just a tiny bit more scoop to it so it wold disappear under polo shirts.",80250,4
80251,"Super cute, but very narrow.",80251,4
80252,Like the color and quality.,80252,4
80253,I'm 5'2 115 lbs and I ordered a large because I didn't want it to look cropped.,80253,4
80253,It shows a little bit of my stomach but that's fine.,80253,4
80253,It fits right which was what I was going for so I'm happy with it.,80253,4
80253,It's really basic and casual and I love it!,80253,4
80254,I ordered a 3t and it was just right for my big 16 month old grandson.,80254,4
80254,He has been wearing 2t but they had gotten too short.,80254,4
80255,got nice compliments on this denim shirtwaist dress.,80255,4
80255,only thing lacking are pockets.,80255,4
80256,Zip a bit stiff,80256,4
80257,"My son is a very large, very tall 5 year old (55lbs).",80257,4
80257,The pants fit him like yoga pants.,80257,4
80257,Made a great deer costume.,80257,4
80258,Very difficult to get the wrinkles out,80258,4
80259,"Looks cute, haven't had a chance to wear it yet",80259,4
80260,Very convenient for desk drawer,80260,4
80261,My son just turned 4 a few weeks ago.,80261,4
80261,"He is a bit taller for his age but, lean.",80261,4
80261,"We ordered the 4-5 size expecting some shrinkage with the cotton briefs (which, there was some).",80261,4
80261,"They actually give some after he has worn them for a bit so, I think we will be able to wear for awhile!",80261,4
80261,We like them enough we ordered them in green!,80261,4
80262,Not stretchy at all and the material is kind of like a cotton feeling.,80262,4
80262,But it's cute and came on time (:,80262,4
80263,Love it very love the colours an it neatness.,80263,4
80264,"Had to wait weeks for delivery, but ordered a second item that got here in a week.",80264,4
80265,Love the style and the look.,80265,4
80265,Size was a bit small for me,80265,4
80266,I LOVE these little earrings.,80266,4
80266,"They are super cute, and appear high quality, especially for the price.",80266,4
80266,My only criticism is the size of the earring backs that came with them.,80266,4
80266,The backs are really loose and slip off very easily.,80266,4
80266,I immediately switched them out so I wouldn't lose the sweet little owls.,80266,4
80267,"Bigger than I expected, but so far holding up great.",80267,4
80267,"Room for plenty of cards, was able to jam 2 of those big thick RFID cards in there, too.",80267,4
80267,"I dig the two large compartments, nice for keeping receipts separate from cash.",80267,4
80267,"Much prefer this to the Alchemy Goods recycled bike tire wallet I was using previously; although I preferred the relatively small profile of the AG wallet, the rubber made it kind of hard to get in / out of my pocket, and it DESTROYED all my cards (they would get black rubber residue on them and the magnetic strips would wear off, no such problems with this cork wallet).",80267,4
80267,"It does *not* look like leather, but is very classy looking.",80267,4
80268,looks better in person than the photographs,80268,4
80269,These are beautiful and well made.,80269,4
80269,They are fairly heavy and sturdy but too small to fit on my nipples.,80269,4
80269,"No fault of the maker, but since they are so sturdy there was no give in the jewelry to spread them to get to fit.",80269,4
80269,I will be returning them.,80269,4
80270,"the company has their own standard on the sizes upper part is ok, the skirt too big and the belt looks for fat people",80270,4
80271,These leggings are good for wearing indoors.,80271,4
80271,They are too sheer and thin to wear in public.,80271,4
80273,"The shirt itself is nice, its soft and comfortable.",80273,4
80273,"The only reason I gave it a 4 is it ran just a little small, otherwise I love it.",80273,4
80273,Plus it arrived on time,80273,4
80274,I bought the purple and beige and for some reason the beige is tighter.,80274,4
80274,I love that it seems to ventilate well at the same time blocks the sun.,80274,4
80275,"FIT:
Fit was just as expected.",80275,4
80275,"I'm 5'6"" & 140 lbs, and the medium fit perfect.",80275,4
80275,"It's not as tight on me as in the picture, but I couldn't have gone any smaller without some serious bunching issues.",80275,4
80275,This does seem to have a short torso because of that issue.,80275,4
80275,"The bust area is also a little lower than I was expecting, but it still covered the goods just fine.",80275,4
80275,"The backside covered my bottom, but if I bent over at all it got a little cheeky.",80275,4
80275,Would have preferred slightly longer for safer coverage.,80275,4
80275,"QUALITY/MATERIAL:
This is literally the most comfortable piece of clothing I own now.",80275,4
80275,I didn't want to take it off.,80275,4
80275,"The quality itself was really good, but the material makes the romper.",80275,4
80275,"OVERALL:
Overall, it was a great buy.",80275,4
80275,"By itself, it looks a little like lingerie and the fit was a little less modest than I was hoping for, but I fixed both issues by pairing it with a kimono and some chunk heeled booties.",80275,4
80276,"It holds the stuff I usually carry: wallet, cheque book.",80276,4
80276,"2 cell phones, small pencil case and small diary.",80276,4
80276,"The only problem is that things fall down, do not stay upright once you take out anything, which to be expected.",80276,4
80276,Typical Kipling quality with professional finish.,80276,4
80276,"Wanted a black one, but there was none, a pretty red though.",80276,4
80277,Size ran a touch small.,80277,4
80277,Front pockets could be deeper.,80277,4
80277,Phone pocket needs to be deeper.,80277,4
80277,Also should add a closure on this pocket to hold phone in.,80277,4
80277,Will probably purchase again only because they closely match a uniform pant that I am required to wear.,80277,4
80278,But is too small.,80278,4
80278,Im 120lbs 5'2 34 C and fit.,80278,4
80278,I order a small bit is too small i'll get a Medium.,80278,4
80278,If you like tight fit small could be ok,80278,4
80279,looks great but a tight fit on my big head,80279,4
80280,"But the thing that I can't get past is the bad, thoughtless design.",80280,4
80280,There are two separate sections that contain credit card slots under the flap.,80280,4
80280,These sections are completely exposed when you lift the flap.,80280,4
80280,There is also a full-length zipped pocket to secure valuables.,80280,4
80280,But none of the two credit card sections are protected inside the zippered compartment.,80280,4
80280,"The bag's outside flap is secured by magnets, but once you lift the flap, whatever is sitting in the open pocket is exposed (yep, that includes the credit card slots).",80280,4
80280,"If I saw this bag in the store, that would have been enough for me to pass it up.",80280,4
80280,"Update: 6/15/2016 - I added a star because the seller, Lecxci, is exceptionally responsive and concerned about customer satisfaction.",80280,4
80280,"Again, this is a truly beautiful bag, but I stand by my comments above about the exposed credit cards slots.",80280,4
80280,I did return the bag.,80280,4
80282,The light weight cotton fabric makes this a perfect summer wrap.,80282,4
80282,The enthusiasm is perfect for pairing with today's longer tops.,80282,4
80282,This is a good quality garment.,80282,4
80283,It's a beautiful gown and the back well there is no back.,80283,4
80283,So it's an open back dress and length is perfect for my height 5'5 and very comfortable,80283,4
80284,I'm glad I bought it larger than I thought I would need.,80284,4
80285,Good for the money.seen others @ stores less quality for about the same$---_some times have to try many different shoes but these fit right away,80285,4
80286,"like this a lot and good price, I have seen it much more expensive other places, including etsy!",80286,4
80286,"( : 0 ) I am a slender size but with broad-ish hips so I sized up, the bottoms are great but the cups are a little bigger than works easily stylistically.",80286,4
80286,small boobs will be familiar with this problem though.,80286,4
80287,I was really happy with this buy but do size up!!!,80287,4
80288,This sweater is really beautiful.,80288,4
80288,"It is just a touch tight but can still be worn and as I am on a diet anyway, it will work for me.",80288,4
80289,Why I bought this product: I was looking for stay-on mittens and socks for my newborn and these were cute.,80289,4
80289,These were also the only ones that I found with velcro fasteners.,80289,4
80289,How the product worked: These mittens and booties are a bit pricey but they stay on better than ones without the velcro.,80289,4
80289,The mittens are also reversible so you have some versatility.,80289,4
80289,I used these in the winter and they kept my newborn warm.,80289,4
80289,Note: These are thicker than the thin cotton mittens and socks.,80289,4
80289,I kept these on my newborn inside the house for hours and it was a bad idea.,80289,4
80289,His hands were wrinkly from sweat and his feet smelled from the sweat as well.,80289,4
80289,I used thin cotton mittens at home and saved these for outings.,80289,4
80289,For outings these are great.,80289,4
80289,The velcro stays on and the thicker material keeps the baby warm.,80289,4
80289,"For winter, I would suggest socks under the booties when going outside.",80289,4
80290,i bought this to complete an outfit cant go wrong with a fringe vest.,80290,4
80290,cant wait to wear it,80290,4
80291,Super exciting they came!!,80291,4
80291,Was expecting them next week but they came earlier.,80291,4
80291,"Was expecting them a little taller, but they're a comfortable heel height.",80291,4
80292,"I really wanted this bracelet, but it never arrived, however, the seller did give me a refund as they were sold out.",80292,4
80292,I have purchased other bracelets just like this one and love them.,80292,4
80292,"Yes they are not extremely sturdy, but they are inexpensive, but they are still nice and cute.",80292,4
80292,I do hope that the seller will have more soon and I can order another one.,80292,4
80292,I gave the four stars because the seller was easy to work with and issued me a full refund immediately.,80292,4
80293,I like the hat itself but my grandson can pull it off his head even when double knotted under his chin.,80293,4
80293,It has good coverage and a light breathable fabric.,80293,4
80294,These are super cute wings but one of the finger straps broke off the wing immediately.,80294,4
80295,"When I saw these pants, I thought how cute!",80295,4
80295,Not to mention they were a great price so I thought what do I have to lose.,80295,4
80295,"They look just like the pair shown, but run super small.",80295,4
80295,I usually wear a medium and ordered a size up and they still looked like they could fit my 10 year old daughter.,80295,4
80295,With that said they do stretch pretty well and I am able to wear them but I would have like them a little bigger.,80295,4
80295,You really can't go wrong for the price!,80295,4
80296,"The shoes arrived in time and my nephew loved them, but they were too small even though I went up a half size.",80296,4
80296,Ended up reordering them for him in a whole size bigger and overnight ingredients them so he could get them on his birthday.,80296,4
80297,"Love, love, love sweet",80297,4
80298,What do expect from a nation raised on turnips and commie flakes?,80298,4
80298,I admire the history and traditions of Russia.,80298,4
80298,And I admire the overall quality and surprising comfort of this shirt.,80298,4
80298,Just order up one size and you'll be fine.,80298,4
80298,"I may go ahead and order another one of these, or other products they offer.",80298,4
80298,Faster than expected delivery.,80298,4
80298,Very satisfied with purchase,80298,4
80300,Very cute bag but smaller than I was expecting.,80300,4
80301,I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long.,80301,4
80301,I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon.,80301,4
80301,They are very lightweight and comfortable.,80301,4
80301,I was surprised how great they felt.,80301,4
80301,I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out.,80301,4
80301,They are so much more lightweight than those.,80301,4
80301,I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems.,80301,4
80301,"The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping.",80301,4
80301,"As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening.",80301,4
80301,I'm only 30 by the way.,80301,4
80301,Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row.,80301,4
80301,"I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem.",80301,4
80301,I wore different shoes today and had no pain.,80301,4
80301,I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time.,80301,4
80301,I will have to rotate wearing them every other day.,80301,4
80301,"For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine.",80301,4
80301,I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.,80301,4
80301,"**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.",80301,4
80301,"I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.",80301,4
80301,"They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",80301,4
80302,The glasses in general are great.,80302,4
80302,My third or fourth pair in various frame types.,80302,4
80302,This pair came with a very distracting scratch in the left lense.,80302,4
80302,Will buy again though.,80302,4
80305,We're larger than other in a size ten still Avery nice shoe.,80305,4
80306,These are very cute.,80306,4
80306,"They're thinner than I thought they would be, but you can't beat the price.",80306,4
80307,Always get compliments when wearing it.,80307,4
80308,"They did not fit me well, so I gave them away as Christmas gifts.",80308,4
80308,I just picked wrong size for myself.,80308,4
80309,"These fit as expected, snug, but not too snug.",80309,4
80309,This is no surprise since they were made for the Asian market.,80309,4
80309,There is no crotch opening in the front.,80309,4
80309,So they're more like tights than long underwear.,80309,4
80310,"Knife is good size, but its very dark.",80310,4
80310,"Hard to see without good lighting, so if you are planning to use it outside without good lighting it won't be as noticeable.",80310,4
80311,Great quality and design.,80311,4
80311,Just thought wish it was a bit bigger to stand out more.,80311,4
80312,It is good quality silver bracelet .,80312,4
80312,"I do not really like the lock, it is very secure which is great, but not very pretty and hard to close by yourself once you put some beads on it, I always ask for help from my family.",80312,4
80312,"Overall it is same bracelet as Pandora, just much cheaper.",80312,4
80312,"I recommend very much if you want one, but not wiling to spend too much on it.",80312,4
80313,ARRIVED ON TIME AND AS DESCRIBED,80313,4
80314,Haven't worn yet but really like it,80314,4
80315,"Its cute, light and fits good.",80315,4
80315,The hearts are thin and one sided.,80315,4
80316,Very cute outfit and extremely nicely made.,80316,4
80316,Love the feel of the fabric!,80316,4
80316,Washes nicely and keeps it's shape and color.,80316,4
80316,Purchased the 1-7y size for my 15 month old and it's pretty big but my son is petite.,80316,4
80316,I do love everything about it and will be purchasing a different color one when he out grows this!,80316,4
80316,Shipping was pretty fast too!,80316,4
80317,"Nice, and of decent enough quality.",80317,4
80317,"However, this item is sized very, very big.",80317,4
80317,"I am a size 10 in pants, and a small or 6 in tops and this set in a size small is almost too big for me.",80317,4
80317,"If you're on the slim side, I would imagine the smallest size may not work for you.",80317,4
80318,RAN SMALL FOR A EXTRA LG.,80318,4
80319,"Very nice product, quality, fabric and color.",80319,4
80320,"It's really cute, I just don't like how the shoulders look puffy from the pleats",80320,4
80321,I was told it would be slightly too small before hand so I ordered one size up and it fit well.,80321,4
80324,"Love this, it is a bit thin.",80324,4
80324,I am short so I had it altered and a slip sew in.,80324,4
80325,"OK so it's not great quality, you can see the stitching on the back holding the cage pattern is pretty cheap, but overall fits well for its size, (I'm a 34C, 5'4, and 140lb) and gives decent support if you have medium to small breasts.",80325,4
80325,"It's cute and for how cheap it is, definitely a decent purchase.",80325,4
80326,"I know that you get what you pay for, and sweatpants are no exception.",80326,4
80326,"I read lots of reviews of cheaper pants, and either they were too big, too small, flimsy material, etc.",80326,4
80326,Then I read about these.,80326,4
80326,"Yes, you pay more, but reviews were mostly positive.",80326,4
80326,"I only need them for post op knee surgery, but still.....",80326,4
80326,"They look well made, are not too long,( in fact I am 5'1"", 146 lbs and the length, with the elastic on the bottom, is perfect.).",80326,4
80326,I gave them 4 stars because I usually wear a medium but ordered large and I am VERY glad I did.,80326,4
80326,"The crotch is perfect for a very petite woman, so If you don't want a constant wedgie get one size up.",80326,4
80326,"They have an elastic drawstring, which helps.",80326,4
80326,"They are also not very baggy, which I DID want for the surgery, but they look good, so I'm okay  with them.",80326,4
80328,This night gown is beautiful but a little tight in the bust area.,80328,4
80328,Luckily you can tie the straps for a more comfortable fit but F your a DD you may be a little uncomfortable,80328,4
80329,Great quality but a little small.,80329,4
80332,Love the whole star wars theme going on here,80332,4
80333,"Beautiful colors , very nice.",80333,4
80334,Wish the image was more bright other than that its pretty cool,80334,4
80335,"It is great just I did not like the quality
But overall was perfect and kids loved it",80335,4
80336,just what I expected,80336,4
80338,I was so excited when it came in the mail!,80338,4
80338,It makes baking more fun!,80338,4
80338,It gets a little hot but I don't really care.,80338,4
80340,Arrived on time and it is so awesome!,80340,4
80341,"the ring is very nice, if careful you can bend it to fit your finger without damaging it.",80341,4
80341,it's not too fragile.,80341,4
80341,it has more detail than I thought it would.,80341,4
80341,"I like it a lot, the only bad thing is how easily it turns my finger green.",80341,4
80341,otherwise I'm happy with it!,80341,4
80342,Fit short in the rise long in the legs.,80342,4
80343,They maintain their ironed look without ironing.,80343,4
80343,The cloth is a little thin and therefore less absorbent than cotton,80343,4
80344,"Loved this purchase and would def buy again, skirt was just a tad uncomfortable so i had to wear it a bit higher but no harm done, i loved it.",80344,4
80345,"Well, this is pretty good deal for the listed price (9.99$ when I bought it).",80345,4
80345,"The colour is slightly lighter than depicted on amazon pictures, but nevertheless we are talking about nice brown colour.",80345,4
80345,"Band was little bit stiffy at the beginning, but it is something that is expected; after couple days of using it, it feels really fine on my wrist.",80345,4
80345,"Band fits nicely with my Citizen watch, as it can be seen on attached pics.",80345,4
80345,"I am somewhat worried when it comes to durability, but time will answer that question, so I will update my review in, fingers crossed, distant future.",80345,4
80346,This is very cute and my little girl is just a little big but she can fit it,80346,4
80347,I little small for the size,80347,4
80348,I contacted bear paw before ordering the shoes through Amazon in regards to sizing.,80348,4
80348,My daughter is a size 11.5 in sneakers and  I didn't know which size I should order in these.her other bear paws are very tight and they were size 12.,80348,4
80348,I ended up ordering the size 13 which they suggested and they are just a little bit big but she can wear them for longer.,80348,4
80348,"She received these bear paws in her Christmas gifts: she's been wearing them at least 2 or 3 times a week since then, and they're holding up nicely!",80348,4
80348,I really have no complaints,80348,4
80349,"I do aqua log everyday, and I have been looking for a full swimsuit like this, for the cold months ahead.",80349,4
80349,"This fits perfectly fine, exact size that I wear, but I have to return it because of the bust area, there is no lining  nor built in cups..",80349,4
80349,"I can deal the the suit not being lined, but not the bust area.",80349,4
80349,"If you guys out there can do without that particular area not lined nor cupped,
then go for it, nice fit.",80349,4
80350,Wear this all the time,80350,4
80351,I was happy with this purchase good fit,80351,4
80352,"I choose an XL given the sizing guide, but it is a little big.",80352,4
80352,"However, that can create a flowy look that can easily be pulled off.",80352,4
80352,"The material has a strange smell, so definitely wash before you wear.",80352,4
80353,Good deal for the price.,80353,4
80354,"Bought the pink ones for my girlfriend as a birthday gift, and she loves them.",80354,4
80354,"That's saying a lot, as she owns more sunglasses than footwear, lol!",80354,4
80354,4 star cuz they aren't polarized.,80354,4
80355,I got this for the gym.,80355,4
80355,The only thing I don't like about it is there is no closure once it wraps around I have to safety pin it to keep it closed.,80355,4
80355,Other women ask me at the gym where I got it now I see 2 other women with the same type but different colour.,80355,4
80356,"I really like these pants, they are the perfect length as seen in the picture, mid waisted and stretch with out showing my undies.",80356,4
80356,"However the material is pretty slick, so they do move around a bit, especially during a run.",80356,4
80356,I find going commando or wearing a thong helps them from sliding down so much,80356,4
80357,"I read the reviews and ordered an XXL, which was WAY too big.",80357,4
80357,"Spent the money to return it and paid more for a L, not sure why the prices differ by size.",80357,4
80357,The Large was a tad tight (I usually wear a Medium unless things run small).,80357,4
80357,But it was wearable and I kept it.,80357,4
80357,"Got many compliments on my ""sweater"", my only complaint is that it looks too real!",80357,4
80357,"But nice to have a holiday shirt that was NOT a sweater, so I was comfortable and not overheated.",80357,4
80358,"well made, stylish, and simple.",80358,4
80359,"Purchased a Large, fits loose around my waist - but I have a wide upper back/muscular arms so just a touch tight up top...does NOT stretch at all.",80359,4
80360,The white is kinda sheer when wet.,80360,4
80360,I wonder about the SPF protection.,80360,4
80361,I really liked these jeans..,80361,4
80361,The only little set back was that the were a bit snugg on my legs..,80361,4
80362,I love this purse.,80362,4
80362,It's beautiful and high-quality like I come to expect from Patricia Nash.,80362,4
80362,The missing star is only for functionality.,80362,4
80362,The closure is on the underside of the purse.,80362,4
80362,"I realized that when I bought it, but I thought the magnet would be a little stronger.",80362,4
80362,It takes some fumbling to get it in place.,80362,4
80363,I liked it very much.,80363,4
80363,It looked pretty good wearing with my long skirt.,80363,4
80364,"This hat runs a bit large, not a problem for me.",80364,4
80364,A few seconds and a few stitches  snugged the band up.,80364,4
80364,"When it arrived the metal ""fashion"" plate had come loose on one side leaving a small hole.",80364,4
80364,I just removed the plate altogether and stitched some decorative buttons in it's place.,80364,4
80364,"It is a cute style, I like the hat.",80364,4
80365,grand son love them would recommend,80365,4
80366,Is kinda tight for me but is nice,80366,4
80367,Perfect for my costume but a little expensive,80367,4
80368,I bought these for my daughter and she loved them.,80368,4
80369,I got this for my dad for Christmas - because my kids DO call him Papa.,80369,4
80369,He loved it and wore it every day for the week I was visiting.,80369,4
80370,"I like the pattern, fabric and flow of this dress.",80370,4
80370,I am very small on top and so pair it with a tank to avoid gaping issues.,80370,4
80370,It will be a staple for transitional season dressing in fall and spring.,80370,4
80370,I think it is a good value.,80370,4
80373,"Loved the shirt, it's stretchy material.",80373,4
80373,Only negative about the shirt is the blue sleeve.,80373,4
80373,"It's not the right color, almost looks green.",80373,4
80373,As for the shorts I usually wear small but I read reviews saying get the shorts a size bigger so I did.,80373,4
80373,The only stretchy part of the shorts is the waist band.,80373,4
80373,Other than that they fit.,80373,4
80374,"First of all,  it came in WEEK early.",80374,4
80374,It was a nice surprise.,80374,4
80374,"As far as the quality goes, it's very soft and seems to be very well made.",80374,4
80374,The rabbit on the front also looks very nice.,80374,4
80374,"My only issue is that it runs a bit tight so the fitting can look off at times,  but that's all.",80374,4
80375,Fit is true to size.,80375,4
80375,I like my t shirts longer and this one had a great length!,80375,4
80375,Needed a Teal color for a group outing and this was the perfect shade.,80375,4
80376,I'm a size 34 A in bras and it fit perfectly for me,80376,4
80377,It's super cute and fits perfect.,80377,4
80377,I am 115 lbs and 5'6 and ordered a small.,80377,4
80377,"My only issue is that the bottoms are somewhat stiff and kinda remind me of a diaper... Other than that, it's super cute!",80377,4
80377,I flipped my white top inside out and paired it with a pair of black bottoms.,80377,4
80378,this is a great shirt it can be casual or you can dress it up a little.,80378,4
80378,its not a sweater but the material is still pretty thick so its a great fall/winter shirt.,80378,4
80378,it does fit me a little tighter than in the picture but i actually like it better that way.,80378,4
80378,I paid full retail for this item and this is my honest and unbiased review,80378,4
80379,The ring is gorgeous and very shiny.,80379,4
80379,It fits a little on the big side.,80379,4
80379,I think the Asscher cut makes the ring look too clear and perfect and up close someone may suspect it isn't a real diamond.,80379,4
80379,"That said I love how it looks on my finger, would have preferred the ability to do a half size to make it fit better.",80379,4
80379,All the stones have stayed in place thus far.,80379,4
80380,Alittle big but I like it,80380,4
80381,"Love it, ordered this belt to go with a black and white dress.",80381,4
80382,"Waistband is thick black fabric elastic soft, that can sit above clothing or flip it under the blouse...",80382,4
80382,Either way it looks great!,80382,4
80384,"Yes, it is small.",80384,4
80384,But it's bright colors.,80384,4
80385,I bought it for my daughter and she said it was pretty and fit well.,80385,4
80386,"Beautiful print, but it fit so snug I returned it and reordered two sizes larger.",80386,4
80387,"Smaller than expected, but cute.",80387,4
80389,You def need boobs to fill it out because it would be hard to wear with a bra.,80389,4
80389,"I'm 5'8"" and 135 lbs and ordered a small.",80389,4
80389,Fits great and very comfy.,80389,4
80390,"Sunglasses arrived exactly as advertised, have worked great so far.",80390,4
80390,"I had to rescrew one of the screws holding the arms on, but that's to be expected with a heavily worn pair or glasses.",80390,4
80390,Definitely worth it for the price.,80390,4
80391,Dress fits somewhat big,80391,4
80392,"The black ones are sick wit it white are aight, clear ones are wack.",80392,4
80392,But thats just my opinion,80392,4
80393,"I'm 5'6 and 138lbs, large chested and very fit.",80393,4
80393,Originally ordered the one size.,80393,4
80393,Way way way too small.,80393,4
80393,The company was kind enough to replace it with the 2xl.,80393,4
80393,This still runs pretty small though.,80393,4
80393,Great customer service but the product needs a little attention if it wants to be sold to average sized Americans.,80393,4
80394,Dress was made of very good & thick quality.,80394,4
80394,Was impressed and satisfied with my order overall.,80394,4
80395,Got this for my husband for a trip to Disneyland.,80395,4
80395,He liked it !,80395,4
80396,look nice good for gift,80396,4
80398,I loved this dress!!,80398,4
80398,I wore it to my prom!!,80398,4
80398,The sizes are a little bigger because I had to get minor alterations and the dress is very long.,80398,4
80398,Hemming would be the way to go.,80398,4
80398,"Also, there is a lot of padding in the bust.",80398,4
80398,But overall the dress was great!,80398,4
80398,I would recommend getting a size or two down from what you normally are.,80398,4
80398,But then again I was scared at first about ordering to do that so I got alterations.,80398,4
80398,"I was suprised by the great quality of the dress, it was better than I expected.",80398,4
80399,This is the only bra I wear.,80399,4
80399,It's comfortable and easy to get on and off.,80399,4
80400,"This item was a little bigger that I expected, but still enjoy it!",80400,4
80401,It was a little smaller than expected but it actually Fits a lot better very warm,80401,4
80402,my wife likes it,80402,4
80403,"I do like these, though they took a few wears to break them in.",80403,4
80403,"The first few wears I had VPLs, but after 3-4 washes they fit very well.",80403,4
80403,They are snug and almost act as shape wear.,80403,4
80403,"I'm 5'10"" and 155 lbs, bought a size Large which fit though I think an XL would fit as well.",80403,4
80404,I ordered a medium in both Pink and Purple.,80404,4
80404,I loved the pink and it was in perfect condition.,80404,4
80404,"I had to return the purple one though, since it had loose threads in the middle of stitches.",80404,4
80404,I re-ordered the purple bag and the second one came with a ripped handle.,80404,4
80404,"However, the seller was quick to help me resolve the issue and sent me a new bag.",80404,4
80404,Overall I think for the price it is a good buy.,80404,4
80405,I am smaller in the bust but needed a medium for the belt to fit.,80405,4
80405,Overall very cute in person.,80405,4
80406,We've bought a few pairs of Champions for our 2 boys - they seem decent quality and are very light but reasonably durable shoe.,80406,4
80406,"The sole tends to wear pretty quickly, but they last for a school year.",80406,4
80407,"Very nice, just what I orderd",80407,4
80408,I purchased this as a gift for my volleballl-loving niece.,80408,4
80408,She thought it was very cute and loved the colors and designs.,80408,4
80408,"It is not as high quality, but for the price we were satisfied.",80408,4
80408,"It was a bit bulky on her hand (she is 11), however she is petite.",80408,4
80408,"Overall, it was a great purchase and my niece loves wearing it.",80408,4
80409,Not too shabby for a knockoff,80409,4
80410,"Bigger than expected, but I receive lots of compliments on how pretty it is.",80410,4
80411,My macbook can fit inside.,80411,4
80412,So many people notice this watch.,80412,4
80412,"So unique, and awesome looking.",80412,4
80412,I bought one as a gift for a friend that has skin issues with metal watches.,80412,4
80412,"And I love the look, so I bought one.",80412,4
80412,"I do have the problem with the band breaking apart sometimes, but just a really good looking watch.",80412,4
80412,It does NOT keep time well... but just a conversation piece makes it worth it.,80412,4
80412,"In the airport, getting the oil changed, at a bar.... so many people notice it.",80412,4
80412,I will buy wood watches from here on out!,80412,4
80412,"What I would love to see, is the same style, but has digital and analog on it.",80412,4
80412,I only found that on the square face watches.,80412,4
80414,Chain could be longer like 24 or 36 inches to slip over your head.,80414,4
80414,This one is hard to put on .,80414,4
80414,"love the picture, looks just like my car Raven.",80414,4
80415,Maybey too many straps hanging off them.,80415,4
80415,i cut one off.,80415,4
80416,The moon was bigger than I expected.,80416,4
80416,My husband wears it all the time,80416,4
80417,I needed a new swim suit and saw this one on here.,80417,4
80417,It has a very nice fit around the areas you want it to be.,80417,4
80417,The drawstring is perfect and has enough give so that you don't have to struggle.,80417,4
80419,Seems to be a good product...I haven't used it yet but plenty big enough for a carry-on.,80419,4
80420,This is very well made and comfortable.,80420,4
80420,The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it did not look like the item in the photo in that there is a lot more blue on the photo while the one I received has more golden hues and hardly any blue.,80420,4
80421,"Leaves a black mark after use, but I wear it to work daily.",80421,4
80422,Just a little tight to pull items out especially middle pocket when all slots full.,80422,4
80423,Worn for a few days and really happy with this purchase.,80423,4
80423,"It was cheap, came quickly, and goes with everything.",80423,4
80423,It doesn't seem like it would ever come lose and I like not messing around with belt holes.,80423,4
80423,I got the black belt/black buckle and I wear this with my dress pants for work and my jeans.,80423,4
80423,"The only down side is the belt loop retainer ""thingy"" is not connected and could easily be lost.",80423,4
80423,"Also be aware: I normally wear a size 38"" and if you wear any larger than that, this belt probably won't fit.",80423,4
80424,Son wears between size 5 and 6.,80424,4
80424,"Shirt fits well, sleeves a bit long but rolled once and it was fine.",80424,4
80424,Pants are also a bit long but able to roll at waistband.,80424,4
80424,Will be able to wear awhile before growing out of them.,80424,4
80425,I expected the flowers to fill the skirt better,80425,4
80426,It feels great but a little tight in the arms.,80426,4
80427,"I like it but when I opened the bag, blouse smelled so weird!!!",80427,4
80428,I wear a 34DDD so it can be hard finding a strapless or backless bra.,80428,4
80428,"Pros: STAYS IN PLACE!, cannot be seen under clothing.",80428,4
80428,"Cons: can be hard to connect without it looking like I'm not wearing a bra, can be hard to line up the middle to connect",80428,4
80429,I love this dress it's made beautifully.,80429,4
80429,I got a 2x because of other reviews but it's still a little snug and I normally where a 12,80429,4
80430,I like the jeans but I thought they might be a little more tighter around the ankle,80430,4
80431,A little smaller than I expected,80431,4
80432,Very good quality for the price.,80432,4
80433,"Cute and very warm, wore for halloween while my daughter was little red riding hood.",80433,4
80433,"Only complaint is the pockets are made kind of cheap, especially considering this cost $25.",80433,4
80434,"The arms aren't as long as the look in the pic but the dress is cute and comfy, can dress it up or down.",80434,4
80435,Great quality and it fits but it did not come with the watch it showed in the picture,80435,4
80436,I was pleased especially the price..,80436,4
80437,Wire inside the tie ends in order to arrange them for optimal cuteness.,80437,4
80437,Adorable fabric as pictured.,80437,4
80437,Fits my less than 1 year old and stretchy enough to fit for a long while.,80437,4
80438,"Bought these for my girlfriend - she was skeptical at first, but she got a ton of compliments when she wore them out to the fireworks and she now loves them.",80438,4
80438,"Easy to charge, easy to change the colors, strobe pattern available.",80438,4
80438,"They do not a little dim in daylight, but at night they are plenty bright.",80438,4
80439,It is a nice suit but the sizes do run small.,80439,4
80439,I had to send ball and reorder another size.,80439,4
80440,"It's very cute, the pattern and color is good!",80440,4
80440,Also the material is good.,80440,4
80440,I'm a 14 in pants and around an 40D in bra and I got a XXL the top is a little loose but it fits well the bottoms fit ok they don't really agree with my hips but over all it's a really cute swim suit.,80440,4
80440,:) It's pretty much what i excepted,80440,4
80441,They are super cute but a little awkward in the fit.,80441,4
80442,These slippers are comfortable and can be worn for a long time even for someone with neuropathy.,80442,4
80443,"I'm a woman's 11 and ordered the 42 and it's just a 1/2"" small.",80443,4
80443,Gave them to my 17 year old daughter and she lives them.,80443,4
80444,"The dress itself is wonderful, nice material.",80444,4
80444,Sadly this dress is made for a woman with skinny legs and wider stomach.,80444,4
80444,"Being pear shaped, in a medium, my thighs fit great, but wayyyy too loose in waist.",80444,4
80444,"I'll have to see if I can get it tailored,if not will return :(",80444,4
80445,"My daughter's review: Very well made, the pistols did start to smell like metal fairly quick after I received it..",80445,4
80445,"But, that's to be expected, it's metal.",80445,4
80445,"The material used on the outside is sort of water proof, but not completely.",80445,4
80445,"Overall, it's a well made purse, and you get what you paid for.",80445,4
80446,"Quality of dress is way better than expected for price, washed about 5 times over summer and retained shape, colors and is pill-free.",80446,4
80446,Only quip is the lining of skirt is super short for a little girl.,80446,4
80446,Had to pair with bike shorts,80446,4
80447,If you have large boobs - forget about it.,80447,4
80447,I am a 38DD and my chest is smushed.,80447,4
80447,It's a really good quality fabric and beautiful color though.,80447,4
80448,"Love it, I usually wear a small and got a med.",80448,4
80448,It was a little tight.,80448,4
80448,Should have gotten a large.,80448,4
80449,"Prettt bracelet, great price.",80449,4
80450,"Love the fit, perfect for work or a run to the supermarket.",80450,4
80450,I weigh about 140lbs.,80450,4
80450,My size is usually 8US.,80450,4
80450,But I ordered US10-12/Asian Tag XL.,80450,4
80450,"Comfy, breathy and stylish.",80450,4
80451,"I'm 5'4, 110 and fits perfect, came with a couple loose strings though",80451,4
80452,Have 3 pair now!!,80452,4
80453,It was a little baggier than i expected.,80453,4
80453,But i still like it.,80453,4
80454,"nice, top a little too big",80454,4
80455,"Smaller than I thought, but my granddaughter grabbed it out of the box and claimed it.",80455,4
80455,She hasn't taken it off since.,80455,4
80456,"Great, strong, material and I prefer the loose fit of the XL.",80456,4
80456,"I ordered a size down, at first, because everyone online said to, but I found a size small to be too restricting in movement.",80456,4
80456,Order the right size!,80456,4
80456,I only took a star off because the hood is a joke.,80456,4
80456,"As long as you aren't using the jacket for a rain jacket, you're good.",80456,4
80456,"Also, the jacket is warmer than expected.",80456,4
80457,Nice material but way too short.,80457,4
80457,"I'm 5'8"" and it looked pretty silly.",80457,4
80458,my second purchase of these.,80458,4
80458,they work better than others I've tried.,80458,4
80459,This jumper is super comfortable.,80459,4
80459,The colors are vibrant and the fit is on point.,80459,4
80459,I paired this with a pair of navy blue slide sandals.,80459,4
80459,I may wear this again in fall months with  navy blue cardigan.,80459,4
80460,"Purchase for my mother to hold when she is in wheel chair, keeps her dry and me with two free hands to push the chair.",80460,4
80461,"Looks nice, it's a birthday gift for my granddaughter",80461,4
80462,My 10 year-old granddaughter purchased this for her mother and both were well pleased.,80462,4
80463,"Bust area was slightly short in length (top to bottom), but this wasn't an issue for me :)",80463,4
80464,"Liked the feel and weight of the fabric, I would have liked to reordered in a  size up if it was available",80464,4
80465,Came and worked as advertised.,80465,4
80465,Would be nice if it came with a 110v plug too.,80465,4
80466,"the straps were long, making the top too big.",80466,4
80467,It's a good product.,80467,4
80467,My granddaughter loved it.,80467,4
80467,But it run alley small.,80467,4
80467,She was only able to wear it once or twice before it was too small.,80467,4
80467,Still allowing for shrinkage in wash it was too small.,80467,4
80468,Nice quality bracelet; very pleased!!,80468,4
80469,"I normally wear xs/s, so it fits me just fine.",80469,4
80469,The quality fits the price.,80469,4
80470,"I bought a black in XL, since I didn't know just HOW small it ran, and I usually wear a women's Small or Medium depending on cut.",80470,4
80470,"It fits like a Men's Small on me, which I don't have a problem with, but it definitely doesn't look like it was built like the preview image to be a bit thinner and form-fitting.",80470,4
80470,"It seems more like a square cut, pretty much just like a men's hoodie.",80470,4
80470,"It's really damn warm though, so it's just what I was looking for in that regard.",80470,4
80470,"Over all, I don't feel upset or regretful of my purchase and I've worn it for about a week straight because the inside is so soft and warm.",80470,4
80471,This is a good tail the only thing that is a con is that it can tear pretty easily.,80471,4
80471,"Overall, it is the exact same color as in the picture and very soft it feels real.",80471,4
80472,great comfortable shirt for hanging around the house and relaxing.,80472,4
80472,these make great shirts to hang out in very soft and comfy.,80472,4
80472,i have a muscular frame and it fit very well,80472,4
80473,It was okay for the price.,80473,4
80473,Gave to a niece for a gift,80473,4
80474,"Great shirt, I got my boys matching ones, they looked and fit great!",80474,4
80475,Not as soft as the originals back in the day...,80475,4
80476,"its perfect, style fit everything..",80476,4
80477,I loved these earrings.,80477,4
80477,I say love-d because one of the earrings broke in half after a week.,80477,4
80477,I took them out for bed and when showering.,80477,4
80477,Just broke one morning while putting them back in.,80477,4
80477,"The pins I wore for a day beforehand, as they are slightly bigger than standard earrings.",80477,4
80477,"They went in just fine, but stretched a tiny bit.",80477,4
80477,"I love them, and they looked great!",80477,4
80477,"Might buy again, still undecided.",80477,4
80478,They don't allow for the front of this garment to touch in the chest area.,80478,4
80478,"It touches in the waist area but not above which is fine i still love it, but for me at least I was expecting something similar to a cardigan that I could sort of wrap around myself.",80478,4
80478,"I still reccomend it, just maybe order a larger size than you need if you expect boob coverage.",80478,4
80479,keeps me very warm,80479,4
80480,Was alittle smaller then expected not to bad though just fit tight,80480,4
80482,I'm sure the fit would be better if my legs weren't chicken legs ( very skinny).,80482,4
80484,"Well constructed, but beware, it is very thick and quite heavy.",80484,4
80486,This is my 3rd pregnancy & the first time I've had to use support.,80486,4
80486,It helps my back & helps keep my belly up so I don't hurt at the end of the day.,80486,4
80486,Wish I would have started using it sooner.,80486,4
80487,Wish the Velcro part would be longer so it can be put on tighter.,80487,4
80487,My daughter can pull this off.,80487,4
80487,Quality is great though.,80487,4
80488,Ran a bit large.,80488,4
80488,These are the nicest active pants I have found though.,80488,4
80488,Good thick material and stay up well during boot camp/tredmill style classes.,80488,4
80489,"Fun, easy Halloween costume.",80489,4
80489,The blue is more teal than the picture but it's a pretty color.,80489,4
80489,My only complaint is the finger holes were really tight around my finger and I had to keep taking it off.,80489,4
80489,My fingers are really small so I was surprised at how tight it was,80489,4
80490,I gave it four stars because when I held them up I could see through them.,80490,4
80490,My daughter said while I was wearing them you could not see anything.,80490,4
80490,I enjoy these more than my swim skirts.,80490,4
80490,I would order them again.,80490,4
80491,I wear these shirts large and loose.,80491,4
80491,Get lots of compliments on the colorful print.,80491,4
80491,They wash nicely in cold water and hang dry.,80491,4
80492,My toddler loves it!,80492,4
80492,"I don't know how durable the material will be, but honestly he will probably outgrow it before we find out.",80492,4
80493,They are long great as a layering item or sleep in ...,80493,4
80493,Comfortable with stretch ... 1x is good if your a 2x in tops or a 38 DDD,80493,4
80494,Exactly as it looks.,80494,4
80495,My 8 year old over love these shoes!!,80495,4
80497,The look is great and the material is soft.,80497,4
80497,However I am short size 4 with 34D chest and it was a bit tight  on the chest area.,80497,4
80497,However size 6 would the dress larger on me.,80497,4
80498,I ordered an XL and it fit for a week.,80498,4
80498,Belly bandit has a trade in program but I won't be using it.,80498,4
80498,After spending $50 I don't plan on spending more to size down when I followed the size chart,80498,4
80499,it really cute love the color,80499,4
80500,However this was sized in like Chinese sizes so When I gave it as a gift I had to let them know what the actual american baby sizes were.,80500,4
80501,it has a lot of slots to put cards and ids,80501,4
80502,Large in the bust and small in the waist.,80502,4
80502,Be sure to buy at waist measurements.,80502,4
80502,The off shoulder sleeves are attached to the dirndl and the apron is removable.,80502,4
80503,Just as the doctor ordered for heel spurs and plantar fasciitis.,80503,4
80504,"Nice scarf, but the colors aren't as rich as pictured here.",80504,4
80505,Much yellower than expected.,80505,4
80506,It's a bit thin and it is rather wrinkled.,80506,4
80506,Wasn't expecting high quality for the price.,80506,4
80506,Looked great and worked for our murder mystery dinner.,80506,4
80507,If you work at a restaurant I would recommend these shirts!,80507,4
80507,"It is worth noting that they run large, I am a petite girl though so perhaps it is just me but I found them to be quite baggy in the waist area.",80507,4
80507,"My only other complaint is that they are a little short length wise so they don't stay tucked into my work pants which is a little bit of a pain, but nothing too tragic really although I am only 5'2"" The colors are great, price is great, and they didn't shrink in the wash which is an added bonus.",80507,4
80507,"They certainly aren't ""wrinkle resistant"" but they don't wrinkle quite as bad as most shirts of this type, and they're easy to quickly iron out.",80507,4
80507,"Overall, I enjoyed these as I needed Oxford shirts in a hurry.",80507,4
80508,This Kimono style jacket is absolutely gorgeous!,80508,4
80508,It looks exactly as pictured and fits perfectly!,80508,4
80508,For reference: I ordered a small and I am about 5'5.,80508,4
80508,Will look great with jeans and booties for the fall!,80508,4
80509,"Works for what I needed: a travel, rain and sun hat.",80509,4
80510,"Size S is like for my mom, is Very Very Very large!",80510,4
80511,It runs a little small but not bad.,80511,4
80512,I based my order on the sizing guide that was listed on the page.,80512,4
80512,"Upon arrival, it was too large in the chest, abdomen and I wear a 36DDD.",80512,4
80512,The fabric did not touch my skin.,80512,4
80512,I returned the item and ordered a size smaller.,80512,4
80512,The return process was easy and the credit to my account was processed quickly.,80512,4
80512,I did like the fit better on the smaller size.,80512,4
80512,"The removal of a star is due to there being a hole beneath the zipper, at the bottom.",80512,4
80512,The hole was large enough that I noticed it immediately and could put my finger through it.,80512,4
80512,"I do recall home economics in High School and sewed the hole closed; however, being a new gown and paying over a hundred dollars, I shouldn't have had to repair the product.",80512,4
80512,It is a lovely dress and I hope to wear it multiple times.,80512,4
80513,"Arrived earlier than anticipated, slightly snug at the chest area but overall i'm satisfied with the purchase, great quality.",80513,4
80514,"Different, cute, chain is nice length.",80514,4
80515,"Sized up, comfortable fit.",80515,4
80516,A little flimsy but the red lenses are great!,80516,4
80517,It has a great fit but is not as long as in the picture but makes for a great and pretty blouse,80517,4
80518,This was really cute for me!,80518,4
80518,"I'm a 32A and I felt fine wearing it, but I think this would be better for flatter chested women.",80518,4
80518,"When washing, the pads move around a bit, but it should be fine if you're careful/ move them back in place.",80518,4
80519,"It has an Asian Indian look to it, that is why I bought.",80519,4
80520,I wasn't sure how I would feel about a string bikini bottom but I love this swimsuit!,80520,4
80520,I am a size 16 typically and I ordered the XL.,80520,4
80520,The top fits perfectly (and it is very flattering).,80520,4
80520,The bottoms are a string bikini bottom but the top is long enough so I don't feel totally exposed.,80520,4
80520,And the top offers colors within that could be matched to a different swimsuit bottom (I will be pairing the top with a swim skirt on an upcoming cruise).,80520,4
80520,The bikini bottoms will be for sunbathing on the ship balcony in our room.,80520,4
80521,"Love the top-dress,sizing was smaller than expected.",80521,4
80522,My son likes it!,80522,4
80523,It was smaller than I anticipated.,80523,4
80524,Very cute top but runs small.,80524,4
80526,I would of rated this purse a 5 but considering I did not like the bow.,80526,4
80526,It was removable so it was perfect.,80526,4
80526,I love everything else about this purse.,80526,4
80526,I will be doing future orders.,80526,4
80528,Good price and fit.,80528,4
80529,It does run a big small if you're an adult wearing this.,80529,4
80530,This was brought as a Christmas gift so for now  have to say it fit as expected.,80530,4
80531,"pretty ring, not as sparkly as the picture but ok costume jewlery",80531,4
80533,These fit my little man ( just turned one) with plenty of room to grow.,80533,4
80533,I hope these last.,80533,4
80533,The clips aren't the best but do the trick.,80533,4
80534,Bought this shirt with the assumption that all Chinese clothes run a bit small but I purchased the size I wear here in USA (Large) and it fits nicely.,80534,4
80534,I have 36D's so some side boobage prevails but nothing I can't just tuck into the front.,80534,4
80534,The shirt is shorter on my torso than I imagined and fits more like a swimsuit (length wise) than a crop halter.,80534,4
80534,"I love that the shirt actually gives my breast a nice lift, especially since a bra is not an option with this top.",80534,4
80534,The fabric is pretty decent and no complaints about the stitching.,80534,4
80534,The pattern is even nicer in person than in picture.,80534,4
80535,"Only took out one star because the quality is so so, but still a great deal and will continue to order more.",80535,4
80536,The Dichro flakes are bigger than the ones shown in the picture.,80536,4
80536,Of course I expected each set to be different and one of a kind.,80536,4
80537,For the price its very good.,80537,4
80537,Three of the bindi packs were very nice large bindis beautiful jewels and then the other three were very small one of the packs way too small its hard to pick them up and place them.,80537,4
80537,But for the price its deffinitely good.,80537,4
80537,I love the three good packs i would order more just to get more of the big ones.,80537,4
80538,"Even with the modest quality and cheap price, this top is very cute and fun for young women and even teenagers, provided that they do not have a large bust.",80538,4
80538,"Perfect for the summer and casual settings, you can use the bands to fashion the top in many different ways.",80538,4
80538,The prints and quality are just as advertised and potential buyers must pay go carefully over the sizing information.,80538,4
80538,The shipping took about a month to North America.,80538,4
80538,"The item was fairly packaged and did not have any odor stemming from it, unlike most imported clothing.",80538,4
80538,I was not impressed at first look out of the box as it seems to not have much to offer.,80538,4
80538,Its quite a simple top made with cheap polyester-type material.,80538,4
80538,"However, I changed my mind later when I tried it on.",80538,4
80538,"The material is not very high quality but considering the price, it is acceptable.",80538,4
80538,The fabric has some stretch and is very silky soft.,80538,4
80538,I wore it for hours and was quite comfortable the whole time.,80538,4
80538,I have very sensitive skin and yet I did not experience any rash or itching after having the top on.,80538,4
80538,The long bands also are quite stretchy and allow for a number of different styles in which one could fashion the garment.,80538,4
80538,The sizing is Asian standard BUT the seller has given enough information for prospective buyers to make the right decision.,80538,4
80538,I usually wear XS or S and my bust size is 34 B.,80538,4
80538,The medium (M) fit perfectly and just as the descriptions had promised.,80538,4
80538,"I must then say: if you have a C+ cup/bra size, the medium will NOT fit well.",80538,4
80538,"So, beware of that.",80538,4
80538,Just read the sellers information carefully and you should be fine!,80538,4
80538,"This top is very fun and sexy for younger women, also appropriate and even kind of sporty for teenagers.",80538,4
80538,The prints are vibrant and diverse.,80538,4
80538,This is a great casual outfit perfect for casual settings and many other purposes!,80538,4
80538,"Oh, and btw, it looks amazing in photos!",80538,4
80538,"I would recommend it, considering how low the price is.",80538,4
80538,*** I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,80538,4
80539,"Accurate description, well-made, but it has limited storage.",80539,4
80542,Other than the bust area it's a nice dress and nice fit,80542,4

80543,But it's too small.,80543,4
80543,The heart is like 1cm long.,80543,4
80543,The color is weird but still good.,80543,4
80543,Small part of the tiny heart is slightly broken.,80543,4
80543,"Overall, i guess it's not bad for the price",80543,4
80544,It was so beautiful but was probably the equivalent of a medium or large in the US.,80544,4
80544,I purposely ordered the largest size they had.,80544,4
80544,I would suggest ordering up at least 2 or 3 sizes.,80544,4
80544,It was nice for the price if it fit!,80544,4
80545,"They are a bit large, but will work!",80545,4
80547,"more orangey than in the picture, but still beautiful.",80547,4
80548,Very nice cover just to small!,80548,4
80549,This is a very pretty.,80549,4
80549,The black belt made the dress casual looking.,80549,4
80549,Had to order a white beaded belt from another place to go with the the dress because it definitely need a belt or sash.,80549,4
80549,The smaller size would have been too small.,80549,4
80550,Too small...order two sizes larger..... once you get the larger size...this shirt is stylin',80550,4
80551,Took well over a month to arrive but when it did I was pleased with it.,80551,4
80554,"Kind of thin , I where and tank under it",80554,4
80555,colors are a little off.. but still beautiful,80555,4
80556,The hat fits my daughter perfectly.,80556,4
80556,But the scarf is way to big.,80556,4
80556,It's like a small blanket for her shoulders.,80556,4
80558,"Very nice, I do like this",80558,4
80559,I don't want to take it off.,80559,4
80559,"I am 5'3"", 150 lbs, 34D and typically wear an 8.",80559,4
80559,"I ordered a medium, and felt that was risky, that I might should order a large.",80559,4
80559,"The bottoms are slightly too tight, but not enough for me to worry about and might be incentive for me to drop those extra 5 lbs.",80559,4
80559,The style is unique and fun.,80559,4
80559,I like the ties up the sides that keep my girls from showing or falling out too much from the side.,80559,4
80559,"I still would prefer to be in a large than a medium, but I wanted to order with Amazon Prime and only black was available in Large to to do that, and I really wanted the splash of color.",80559,4
80559,I'm quite happy and excited to wear it!,80559,4
80560,"This set is great, the pants fit perfectly however the two suits are too big, she's gonna have to grow into them.",80560,4
80561,Wow I'm from the bahamas and I don't see good quality clothes for less.,80561,4
80561,This is am awsome dread material Is not cheap or see thru I will be ordering from this seller again,80561,4
80562,I first ordered the blue one and the size fits just right.,80562,4
80562,I am 5'1 and 99 lbs and I ordered size 4.,80562,4
80562,Then I ordered the black one with the same size.,80562,4
80562,There's inconsistency with the sizing.,80562,4
80562,The black one feels tighter around the arms and the body.,80562,4
80562,"When I compared them side by side, it's obvious that the black one is smaller than the blue one even though they're both a size 4.",80562,4
80562,The lace on both is beautiful and very classy.,80562,4
80562,It's soft and it has lining that isn't necessarily see through unlike the other asian clothes they sell here.,80562,4
80562,It looks great in an A line skirt.,80562,4
80563,Love the sweater but it was too small.,80563,4
80563,I ordered a 3x but it fits like a 2x,80563,4
80565,"Best wallet I've had in years, Iphone fits with everything else- able to leave the house with this and keys and no purse needed!",80565,4
80566,I love the color.,80566,4
80566,The sheer lace is soft and not itchy like some of the cheaper lace you find in this price range.,80566,4
80566,You can wear it with pasties or underneath a tank.,80566,4
80567,Very soft and great color.,80567,4
80567,Runs a little bit small though...,80567,4
80569,"Haven't used it for swimming yet, but it is sufficient for everyday wear.",80569,4
80570,Great looking piece of holder worth getting for a small number of cards.,80570,4
80570,Dollar bills have to be folded and kept and bear in my mind the more folds the harder it gets to close.,80570,4
80570,If you are a 2 to 3 cards person then its worth getting else look for something bigger.,80570,4
80570,The only downside is that it scratches easily.,80570,4
80570,I must admit that I actually ordered the dark metal color but somehow silver got delivered.,80570,4
80570,By anyways it was just a small matter.,80570,4
80571,"The locket is nice, it just didn't come with the pads for the oil.",80571,4
80571,Even though it said it does!,80571,4
80571,I'll just have to order some.,80571,4
80571,"It came in a plastic bag too, not the cloth bag like it shows.",80571,4
80571,Still pleased with the purchase.,80571,4
80572,The size chart was off.,80572,4
80572,I sized it  to fit but actually needed 2 size smaller to get the sleek tight feel.,80572,4
80572,The material is sturdy.,80572,4
80572,I wear it around the house.,80572,4
80572,Haven't graduated to wearing it out.,80572,4
80572,To me it suits it's purpose.,80572,4
80572,I find that I eat less and am starting to get more of an hourglass shape.,80572,4
80572,Have been using it for a month.,80572,4
80573,They run very big but they will be great once they fit!,80573,4
80574,These pants fit perfect.,80574,4
80574,They are soft and smooth.,80574,4
80574,"Had a pouch for cell phone, iPod",80574,4
80575,I bought this crop top to go with some high waisted palazzo pants I just got.,80575,4
80575,I like it but I don't *love* it.,80575,4
80575,It's a cute crop top but it just looked like a nicer quality when I viewed the pictures.,80575,4
80575,It will do though.,80575,4
80575,I usually wear a medium in tops but they only had a small available and I read reviews that this top runs large.,80575,4
80575,I took a chance and ordered the small.,80575,4
80575,I'm a 34B for reference.,80575,4
80575,I don't think I could get away with wearing a bra unfortunately because of the way the top is cut.,80575,4
80575,That's to be expected though.,80575,4
80576,My wife could not stop smiling as soon as she unwrapped my little surprise.,80576,4
80578,It is the length that is small to me.,80578,4
80579,On the small side but wearable,80579,4
80580,"I ordered the bikini labeled, ""black 1"".",80580,4
80580,It is a standard triangle bikini top that also came with a scrunched bikini bottom that ties at the sides.,80580,4
80580,"I am a 36D cup, I have a 30 in waist, and 37 in hips, so I ordered a medium.",80580,4
80580,"The bikini top fits well, and looks great.",80580,4
80580,"The bottom, however, has an awkward fit in the front.",80580,4
80580,"It's a little wide-set and appears kind of ""baggy"" almost like it was meant for women with wide vaginas lol.",80580,4
80580,Idk how to explain it.,80580,4
80580,"Tying the strings a little tighter seems to alleviate the ""baggy"" appearance at the crotch, but not by much.",80580,4
80580,"Overall, this was a good purchase.",80580,4
80580,"Even though I'm not a fan of the bikini bottoms, the top fits and looks great and it was still pretty cheap.",80580,4
80581,"Very cute dress, I ordered a small.",80581,4
80581,I am 5'4' 93 LBS and it fits perfectly on me.,80581,4
80583,I like them but the photo shows them dark as I wanted.,80583,4
80583,They are a much lighter jade green.,80583,4
80584,"eyes are very gold, I thought black.",80584,4
80585,Super cute- my 11 year old fits into the medium.,80585,4
80586,I liked the slim fit.,80586,4
80587,"I am 5'7"" and 120lbs, and am usually either a small or medium.",80587,4
80587,"I ordered a medium, and it fits perfectly.",80587,4
80587,The quality of this coat is good for $30...,80587,4
80587,"So don't let the perpetually-discounted ""$200 regular price"" mislead you - this is NOT a $200 coat by any means.",80587,4
80587,"But it's cute & unique & fits well if you order a size up, and the quality is decent enough to be comfortable and look good.",80587,4
80588,"Kind of boxy, but still pretty cute.",80588,4
80589,This product is OKAY; it looks a lot different than the picture; it does not come with the thigh high stocking and the back totally laces up which is kind of annoying at first; super cute and a really nice; makes your body look great!,80589,4
80591,"Great shirt, but the medium was a bit bigger than expcted, more like a large (in my opinion)",80591,4
80592,Honestly it's pretty but not a huge fan of it.,80592,4
80592,The center stone sets too high.,80592,4
80592,But still really pretty for price.,80592,4
80593,I wish the shirt was longer but slimmer..it's a Lil loose but both long enough..but still cute shirt,80593,4
80594,This is a very nice pocketbook but unfortunately too large for me.,80594,4
80594,My fault-I should looked at the measurements better.,80594,4
80594,My niece loves it so I am giving it to her for her Birthday coming up.,80594,4
80594,Very nice and loved the color.,80594,4
80596,"The material wasn't quite what I was expecting, it's got a slightly rough texture to it and the waistband wasn't an even thickness all round, but as it was a purchase for a Halloween costume, it was what it was.",80596,4
80596,"Also, on the 5'2"" tween that wore this it hit slightly lower than the picture.",80596,4
80596,"I haven't washed it yet, so I can't attest to whether it shrinks or bleeds, but I suppose I'll find out this weekend.",80596,4
80597,Met all my expectations .,80597,4
80598,I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I can't wait to wear it Saturday night!,80598,4
80598,"THINGS TO KNOW:

Dress is really short - but I knew that based on the picture here.",80598,4
80598,Wear tights or boyshorts underneath and call it a day.,80598,4
80598,It's cheap fabric - but I knew that since I bought at a super cheap price.,80598,4
80598,Pay hundreds of dollars.,80598,4
80598,"Dress comes with detachable train, veil, garter, gloves and choker.",80598,4
80598,Dress top (from boob area to waist) has some type of cheap lace (that I happen to like).,80598,4
80598,Dress bottom has that satin look to it.,80598,4
80598,"Under the flair part, it has a layer of tulle attached, which does the same thing a single layer petticoat would do.",80598,4
80598,I actually love this because it gives the dress a lil fluff.,80598,4
80598,There's a zipper on the back of the dress.,80598,4
80598,Dress has elastic spaghetti straps - that you can cut off if you're into the strapless thing.,80598,4
80598,COLOR: dress is white.,80598,4
80598,And it looks dirty.,80598,4
80598,It's meant to look dirty since it's a CORPSE.,80598,4
80598,"I'm not sure if the bride is a burnt victim and the ""stains"" are meant to be smoke stains... Or if she was buried with her wedding dress and now she's all dirty.",80598,4
80598,"The ""stains"" are blackish/grayish color and they are on the front and back of the dress.",80598,4
80598,"Stains can also be seen on the accessories (veil, train and the other stuff).",80598,4
80598,SIZING: I actually took a chance here.,80598,4
80598,"They had what they call ""Free Size"" stating the measurements to be: Bust: ""88cm/34.6"" Waist: 76cm/29.9"".",80598,4
80598,This dress fit me like it was made for me.,80598,4
80598,"For your reference MY measurements are as follow: Bust 36C (or 34D), Waist: 28, the hips measurements do not matter since the dress is only tight on the breast/torso area.",80598,4
80598,"THE DRESS DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF STRETCH so if you have bigger breasts/waist than me, don't buy this as you will not fit in it.",80598,4
80598,"All in all, the crappy picture they have here of the costume, is pretty much what you get.",80598,4
80598,Totally worth the twenty something bucks I paid for it.,80598,4
80598,I'm definitely a happy camper.,80598,4
80599,"For an extra large shirt its a little snug, but good quality fabric and the letters have stayed on after multiple washings",80599,4
80600,Love these workout pants,80600,4
80601,Pretty dress but rather thin.,80601,4
80601,You definitely need to wear a slip underneath.,80601,4
80602,I returned because I needed a white pair of sandals and not cream colored.,80602,4
80602,I love the fit and feel just not the pearlized white color.,80602,4
80603,"I'm a size 32, which is what i purchased, but it's kind of tight around the waist.",80603,4
80603,"While it comes with it's own 'belt', it doesn't really have any other hoops to wear another belt",80603,4
80604,I think this is a really pretty shirt.,80604,4
80604,It's definitely worth the price and I love the softness and the color.,80604,4
80604,"It has two problems: the shirt is shorter than expected, and it wrinkles very easily.",80604,4
80604,"I read another review where a taller woman (5'9"") found it too short.",80604,4
80604,"I thought since I'm quite a bit shorter (5'4"") I might not have the same problem since I also ordered a medium.",80604,4
80604,"The shirt must have been shortened even more because it reaches right to my crotch, nowhere near the 5 inch height difference.",80604,4
80604,"The material is light and flows nicely, just like I'd expect from this style.",80604,4
80604,It's also soft and comfortable.,80604,4
80604,"It does wrinkle easily, especially as I sit all day in my office.",80604,4
80605,The t-shirt looks good.,80605,4
80605,But size was tight.,80605,4
80606,Like it but wish they had other colors.,80606,4
80606,Would love all diff color lettering as well.,80606,4
80606,Black just ain't so hot for girls.,80606,4
80607,be very wary if you have a big butt!,80607,4
80607,it is very cute but just remember when you're picking your size that the bottom runs smaller than the top and those straps are tight.,80607,4
80607,it's definitely worth the try and hassle of returning it if it doesn't work out because it could be an amazing suit.,80607,4
80608,"Material soft, great price, went with so many outfits, worked well for layers.",80608,4
80609,Good cheap gag gift,80609,4
80610,"I like it,  but it was too small,  but very nice.",80610,4
80611,It wasn't quite as long as I was expecting it to be but I still really like it.,80611,4
80612,Size is slightly smaller than expected.,80612,4
80612,You should offer a XXL,80612,4
80613,Get what you pay for honestly.,80613,4
80613,"Can tell it's not high dollar, but I still love it!",80613,4
80614,"This wallet is roomy enough to hold my small iPhone, cash, all of my cards and a few business cards.",80614,4
80614,"It had a very strong chemical smell for several days, which could be smelled through my purse even after airing it out for a couple of days.",80614,4
80614,The smell has dissipated after a couple of weeks and I am happy with the wallet.,80614,4
80615,"Okay, I just wish there were more colors.",80615,4
80616,It's a good ptoduct for the price.,80616,4
80616,I wish the hat was more sturdy & even in shape all around.,80616,4
80618,It's like shape wear but less confining.,80618,4
80618,I wear size 22/24 women's plus (3XL) & I purchased size 4 (at 4 months pregnant with second child).,80618,4
80618,It serves its purpose.,80618,4
80618,You can still see buttons/zippers are undone but not if you use layers of clothing.,80618,4
80618,"Not sure if I'd pay $30-$40 for this again, though.",80618,4
80619,"Beautiful dress, but the 4X is made for smaller chested big girls.",80619,4
80619,Fits more like a Walmart size 18.,80619,4
80619,"I wish I could have kept it, but I kept my weight instead =(",80619,4
80620,"The back didn't close for me, the bust was too high and the length of the dress was a little too long.",80620,4
80620,But these are minor things that can get fixed.,80620,4
80621,hard to tell online but,80621,4
80622,Would give it 5 stars but a little snugg on my 5'4 athletic built daughter but she loves the color,80622,4
80623,Really cute style of leg warmers.,80623,4
80623,My only issue is they are already loose and fall down while wearing them alone.,80623,4
80624,"Great socks, great colors, great lasting, great fit!!",80624,4
80625,"I am not one to write reviews, but this strap is amazing.",80625,4
80625,"I've paid hundreds of dollars on similar mesh straps, both OEM and aftermarket, and this one is right on par with them.",80625,4
80625,"It's solidly built, with good finishing along the sides (no sharp edges at all).",80625,4
80625,"I paired it with a Seiko Turtle, which I think pairs perfectly.",80625,4
80625,The only reason I give it 4 stars is that the clasp is not the easiest to operate.,80625,4
80626,Haven't worn them yet but they feel & fit wonderful.,80626,4
80626,Living in the south I needed a lite hiking sock.,80626,4
80626,I was shocked by the color that came!,80626,4
80626,Doesn't look at all like the willow color displayed but appears black which I did NOT want to go with Khaki colored Northface pants.,80626,4
80627,The ring was a smaller than anticipated.,80627,4
80628,Good product and fit as expected.,80628,4
80629,"You can ask for a less size,  it's big.",80629,4
80629,However it is nice quality :),80629,4
80630,Nice quality of shirt.,80630,4
80631,"Work well as v-neck thermals/undershirts, but stitching isn't the greatest quality.",80631,4
80632,"Great, soft sweater - no complaints",80632,4
80633,Larger suction hook then expected.,80633,4
80635,"Good quality, I usually wear 18/20 but these are a bit snug.",80635,4
80635,I am an apple shape so that may be the issue.,80635,4
80636,the sleeves are a little short but that is because i'm so tall.,80636,4
80636,i love it so much!,80636,4
80637,It was very pretty!,80637,4
80637,The top was too small but the bottoms did fit.,80637,4
80637,"I ended up giving it to my friend, but it is still a very PRETTY swimsuit and my friend loved it!",80637,4
80638,"originally ordered for myself to replace a broken purse, but it was more of a school bag then purse, so my daughter gladly traded me her working purse for this.",80638,4
80638,"its got a decent strap, holds things well and made with nice fabric that should last a few years.",80638,4
80640,I'm giving it 4 stars because it was VERY inexpensive and I wasn't expecting something absolutely spectacular.,80640,4
80640,I am pleasantly surprised with how nice it actually looks however.,80640,4
80640,The material is super thin and prone to static cling but if you wear a slip underneath it's much better.,80640,4
80640,"Also, I am a pretty tiny person but I needed to buy a large in this dress for it to fit, so I recommend buying a size or two larger than usual.",80640,4
80640,"Anyway, this will be a fun dress to wear in the upcoming Spring!",80640,4
80642,It's pretty but didn't fit,80642,4
80643,This was exactly what I was looking for.,80643,4
80643,"The colors are vibrant, the fabric is soft and flows good.",80643,4
80643,The one thing I've noticed though is that some pieces of the fringe have fallen off.,80643,4
80643,I haven't washed it yet so I'm not sure how it will hold up in the washer.,80643,4
80643,"It's a good length, his just under my butt and the fringe hits just above my knees.",80643,4
80643,I'm very busty however so it doesn't close all the way.,80643,4
80644,Too big for my body type but the customer service was great,80644,4
80645,Shoes fit my son perfectly and seem very comfortable for long time wear for play.,80645,4
80645,"I was sent the incorrect color, which was very quickly and hassle free refunded.",80645,4
80645,I will more than likely purchase these again as my son grows.,80645,4
80646,This shirt is cute.,80646,4
80646,"I haven't worn it yet, as I'm saving it for ""date night"".",80646,4
80646,"I agree with the other reviewers that the seam of the liner could have been finished better as you can see it through the lace, but as it's open you could easily trim it if it bothers you.",80646,4
80647,"Very pretty, adjustable band, fits any wrist.",80647,4
80647,May be a bit tricky at first until you get the hang of it.,80647,4
80648,"Nice shirt, good fit.",80648,4
80649,work well and easy to trim to correct size,80649,4
80650,"Looks great, just be aware that it has a ""Made in China"" graved in the inside.",80650,4
80651,And I will keep them.,80651,4
80651,But the Microsoft bag was not included in the shipment.,80651,4
80652,"I ordered the XL dress, which says it fits 16-18 US.",80652,4
80652,I normally wear a size 16 but this felt more like a 14.,80652,4
80652,"The arms were very snug, as other reviewers have said.",80652,4
80652,"I received a sapphire blue color, which is what I was expecting from the picture.",80652,4
80652,"It is a pretty dress, but simply did not fit.",80652,4
80653,Great price shipped free and quickly.,80653,4
80654,"Arrived on time, exactly as described, shorter than expected.",80654,4
80655,This will be a sweater my daughter wears to school in fall and wi get here in the south.,80655,4
80655,Her schools colors are navy and white.,80655,4
80655,The sweater is navy and sort of a cream.,80655,4
80655,It will look cute with uniform skirts and navy polo shirts for school.,80655,4
80656,Size ordered fits as expected.,80656,4
80656,Looked real nice when received.,80656,4
80656,After a week of wearing it its pretty scratched up.,80656,4
80656,Very light an almost plastic feeling.,80656,4
80656,But hey its a 14 dollar ring.,80656,4
80656,Over all i like it,80656,4
80657,The shipping is a bit long but I think it is worth the wait if you really like Ace.,80657,4
80657,I had read that sometimes some unlucky person will get 2 of the same earring.,80657,4
80657,So i bought two just in case.,80657,4
80657,"Both showed up packaged with one happy and sad face, so no problems for me.",80657,4
80657,The only thing is that I wear them A LOT (like everyday) and the one pair has begun to not appear silver anymore but rather copper because of the oils of skin changing the color of the metal.,80657,4
80657,It does sometimes leaves smudged circles on my ear because of the black outline but easily washed off in a quick shower.,80657,4
80657,"Overall, i would still wear the second pair and if it ruins then I WOULD order again.",80657,4
80657,(its been like 4 months and that is when the first pair is getting the copper tone; have yet to use to second one),80657,4
80658,I had a bunionectomy in December and my healing has been super slow.,80658,4
80658,In April I started working out again doing Jazzercise and class I noticed significant swelling.,80658,4
80658,Wearing these socks during classes this has kept the swelling down and makes it easier to get back in shape after being down for almost 3 months!,80658,4
80659,The jacket looks just like the picture.....love it....,80659,4
80660,I purchased these for my friend and she really loves that she can wear dangle earrings now.,80660,4
80661,Can't really rate the comfort due to the size.,80661,4
80661,I had read other comments that said to order a full size larger.,80661,4
80661,I found this not to be the case.,80661,4
80661,I returned (at my expense)and reordered a half size larger than my normal hoping that will fit properly.,80661,4
80661,I usually ware dinners or under armor that seem to be true to size.,80661,4
80661,I look forward to experiencing this boot and rating them appropriately.,80661,4
80662,"Style was fine, they were just too small.",80662,4
80663,bought this for my Moms as her Birthday Present and she liked it.,80663,4
80663,the color is a bit dull but fits her wrist well and she wears it all the same.,80663,4
80663,I recommend Doinshops make the braclets more colorful but other than that was a great buy.,80663,4
80664,"I ordered this shirt in a size 3xl, as it is in Asian sizes and I usually wear between Medium and Large.",80664,4
80664,The end result is that it looked really large but fitted none-the-less and I made it work by adding accessories.,80664,4
80664,I must note that the yellow in the feather is really bright (think highlighter yellow lol).,80664,4
80664,In any event I got alot of compliments on the shirt and am very satisfied with this item.,80664,4
80665,This dress looks awesome on!!,80665,4
80665,Great purchase for the price!,80665,4
80666,Not heavy enough to provide any warmth but very nice design (The Wife loves butterflies) and fantastic price.,80666,4
80667,"Great dress
The material is a bit heavier then I expected but super cute and would work with tights and boo it's",80667,4
80668,MY FAULT I ORDERED INCORRECT SIZE.,80668,4
80668,I RETURNED THIS SKIRT.,80668,4
80669,It came in a week.,80669,4
80669,I loved wearing it but the necklace started to rust in a few days and lost color.,80669,4
80670,"Young lady receiving this really into Shopkins, and loved her new nightgown.",80670,4
80670,"Has already worn it, and it looked really cute on her.",80670,4
80670,"Personally, I thought that the material could have been a little less flimsy",80670,4
80671,"Very nice purse, it's a little larger than I wanted but, it's such a beautiful purse I'll keep it.",80671,4
80672,I picked one size larger than what I would not ally wear and it fit perfect.,80672,4
80673,I bought the 18m size and it fits my daughter in 9m old American sizes.,80673,4
80673,"Except for that, I love this outfit.",80673,4
80673,I get lots of compliments on it every time she wears it.,80673,4
80673,"It's not exactly like Bruce lee wore, but I think if it was it wouldn't look nearly as cute.",80673,4
80673,Soft and the colors so far have help up alright.,80673,4
80674,"It fits a little tight, so make sure to go up a size.",80674,4
80674,"I'm a 32 B, 108 lbs and bought a size medium and it fits great!",80674,4
80675,I'm 5'8 174 lbs and I ordered a large.,80675,4
80675,The dress fits a little tight around my thighs ( I have big thighs).,80675,4
80675,I also have broad shoulders also!,80675,4
80675,The dress shoes everything if I bend over it's a cute dress but it's too tight around the arm pit and back area.,80675,4
80675,Other than that it's a great dress if your not built like me.,80675,4
80677,Buttons might need to be stiffened up a little.,80677,4
80678,Comfortable for just about anyplace.,80678,4
80678,I ordered a size larger than normal.,80678,4
80679,"Order size S/m it fits good, not too big.",80679,4
80680,this is one of the most comfortable skirts i have ever purchased.,80680,4
80680,its not to heavy or to light and fits as expected when ordering the size you need,80680,4
80681,Good strap for the price,80681,4
80682,"Just received this beautiful tops, and it exceeded my expectation!",80682,4
80682,"I was worried about the sizing, but it is perfect.",80682,4
80682,"I wear a size 4, and I ordered M (size 4).",80682,4
80682,"Also, the length is great.",80682,4
80682,Love the V-shape at the bottom.,80682,4
80682,"I plan to wear it with jeans or black leggings, and probably throw a jacket on top.",80682,4
80683,"I really like this bag, the canvas is heavy and the short straps are comfortable to hold.",80683,4
80683,The one problem is that the metal clips for the longer strap are made from cheap metal.,80683,4
80683,"First day using the bag, over the shoulder strap, it broke within minutes, and I didn't have that much in the bag.",80683,4
80683,So now I either have to fix the strap myself or return the item.,80683,4
80683,"The main zipper for the bag does not completely close off the bag, the ends are loose, which means the stuff could still fall out or hands could still get in.",80683,4
80684,"The robe itself fit great, but the belt was a little short (due to a safety issue with choking maybe?",80684,4
80684,My son is only in the 14th percentile in weight and the belt was so short that it was hard to tie so it would stay tied around his skinny tummy unless I tie it in a knot...and I ordered a size bigger than he really is (ordered a 3T instead of a 2T) so it would fit longer.,80684,4
80684,I ended up going to the fabric fabric store and got more fabric to add to the belt and now it works great.,80684,4
80685,The lady has some very expansive squash blossoms but  has enjoying this set to wear an people hs had nice thing to say about it.,80685,4
80686,"Im 5.2"" tall and 125 pounds and it fits perfectly, the fabric is ok and the quality is good for the price I paid for it.",80686,4
80686,"My only complaint is that the color pink is more like
peach or coral and not really  pinky but overall I'm happy with my purchase.",80686,4
80687,Beautiful top that hits just about at the tops of the hips.,80687,4
80687,The color was true to the picture.,80687,4
80687,My only complaint is that I ordered my size based on the measurements listed.,80687,4
80687,"I am a 36FF in the chest, so in inches I should have perfectly fit the XXL.",80687,4
80687,Though it's not noticeably big (except under the arms) I could definitely have gone down a size to XL.,80687,4
80687,"However, that would be my only complaint.",80687,4
80687,I am ordering two more (in XL)!,80687,4
80688,I bought the size recommended for a 7 year old it ran a little small I probably should of sent it back but kept it,80688,4
80689,Cute top to wear with leggings.,80689,4
80689,However it is more one dimensional than I thought it would be.,80689,4
80689,It appeared in the photo to have a second piece overlap panel on the front.,80689,4
80689,But for the price it's definitely worth it,80689,4
80690,"A liitle bigger than my size, but cute  dress and good material.",80690,4
80691,It was smaller than expected even though I ordered it a size bigger than I normally wear because of some past reviews but I bought some shapewear to go under it and it worked great.,80691,4
80691,"I was pleased with the color, length and quality of fabric.",80691,4
80691,I wore this to my son's wedding and felt great!,80691,4
80692,Collar fits a little funny but other than that it is cute for the price!,80692,4
80693,"Had an awards dinner, shirt came in good time, fits good.",80693,4
80695,"The glasses look like the advertisement on line, I was pleased",80695,4
80696,Fun and sassy and oh so comfortable.,80696,4
80697,Cute trendy crop top with nice stretch and looks awesome with high waisted shorts or skirts.,80697,4
80697,Perfect for my fifties theme engagement photos!,80697,4
80698,This set of 00 silicone plugs came to my mailbox in KS only two days after I ordered them with standard shipping.,80698,4
80698,"I love the way these thin plugs extend outward more so than other silicone plugs and ""hug"" your ear.",80698,4
80698,There is absolutely no fear of them falling out for any reason.,80698,4
80698,I pop them in and don't worry at all the way I do with stone plugs (of course).,80698,4
80698,They appear just like the picture indicates.,80698,4
80698,My only issue with these is that at least three of them had burrs on the inside which caused me to spend a good ten minutes trying to scrape them off with a very sharp knife.,80698,4
80698,In most other silicone plugs I've purchased in jewelry shops there have been no burrs.,80698,4
80698,I understand they're a great value and most likely made very cheaply but the burrs were noticeable from a distance of several feet.,80698,4
80698,"4/5 for fast shipping, good price and decent quality.",80698,4
80700,Was good.i like ot,80700,4
80702,quite a bit larger than expected but my daughter loves it anyway.,80702,4
80702,The material is thin so I wouldn't necessarily use this as a walking around t-shirt but definitely works well as a sleeping or workout T.,80702,4
80703,For some reason I received a size larger in this dress than I ordered.,80703,4
80703,"Like the plastic wrap that the dress came in said the right size, but the tag on the dress itself says a size larger.",80703,4
80703,It's not a huge deal because I planned on belting it anyway.,80703,4
80703,The material is really nice.,80703,4
80703,Much nicer than I expected for the price.,80703,4
80703,"The big issue I have is the sleeves are too long for me, but I am 5'2"" so that's not unusual.",80703,4
80705,The color of the logo isn't exactly what I had hoped but for the price it is a nice shirt.,80705,4
80707,Fits a little strangely in the bust area - maybe it would be OK for people with larger breasts.,80707,4
80707,I wear a size medium and purchased a size medium and this fits pretty well but seems long from neck to waist giving a bit of a bunching effect unless I pull the bottom edge down.,80707,4
80707,The material is nice and stretchy and is semi-see through.,80707,4
80708,Just be careful because they are exactly true to size and nothing more.,80708,4
80708,They are tapered too.,80708,4
80709,"It looks very nice with jeans, good quality for the price.",80709,4
80709,"A little tight in hips, I'm 121lbs, 5, and my hips 34 in.",80709,4
80709,"I bought a size L. I did not ordered this pattern, but it's ok.",80709,4
80710,Material really thin but I think the dress is cute,80710,4
80712,I like that it doesn't make me feel like a old lady wearing it.,80712,4
80712,"It's very fashionable, but haven't been wearing it long enough to see benefits though.",80712,4
80713,They do the trick.,80713,4
80714,It's a cute dress.,80714,4
80714,It fit me a little longer than what I had expected.,80714,4
80715,"When these arrived, they turned out to be ankle length even though it says knee length.",80715,4
80715,I contacted the seller to return them or to exchange them for the correct length.,80715,4
80715,The seller has promised to send me the right ones (and did not want me to send back what I have) but it has been weeks and I have heard nothing further.,80715,4
80715,"The lenth is important to me, and I have not found this length from other sellers so I really WANT the correct ones!",80715,4
80715,"Other than that, the pants I received are ok-- very lightweight, seem well-enough made for the price, a little bit tight for me but stretchy enough to wear.",80715,4
80715,Just THE WRONG LENGTH!,80715,4
80715,The very same day as I wrote this a new pair arrived at my door.,80715,4
80715,"As you can see from the picture, they are now knee length, though somewhat less puffy than in the picture.",80715,4
80715,They fit great and are very comfy.,80715,4
80716,it's a nice looking cap but if u have a lot of hair and big head it won't fit.,80716,4
80717,"This is kind of small, but it fits alright.",80717,4
80717,It is not as roomy as I had hoped.,80717,4
80717,"The material is thin, but not TOO thin.",80717,4
80717,Just right for working out in.,80717,4
80718,The jacket seems to be great.,80718,4
80718,It fit a little big on my five year old but hopefully it will last throughout this year and she will grow into it and it will still fit next year.,80718,4
80718,Had a little smell to it but seems to have went away just sitting out in our house.,80718,4
80720,I couldn't be more happy it was a tad hard snapping it closed but makes me think it's more secure only reason I don't give 5 stars is mine came bent and I had to fix that,80720,4
80721,Love this adorable shirt!!,80721,4
80721,The fabric is super soft (a little thicker than I expected) and it fits well.,80721,4
80722,Just a bit on the small side but plenty comfortable.,80722,4
80723,Somewhat small but cozy.,80723,4
80724,"The packaging clearly states that this is a shirt and not a dress - it's very, very short.",80724,4
80724,I bought her usual size and wish I'd bought the next size or two up.,80724,4
80724,It just fits with the arms very snug.,80724,4
80724,I may lop off the sleeves and turn it into a short-sleeved shirt.,80724,4
80724,My daughter loves it - the deer decal seems ironed on and I'm going to very carefully wash it.,80724,4
80724,"The little flower in the deer's ear is not sewn on, but is a pin that you pin on.",80724,4
80724,"Again, she loves this because she enjoys moving the pin around on the design - but be careful about positioning it on the decal as it will leave holes.",80724,4
80724,I may end up simply sewing the little flower on so she's not tempted to play with it during class.,80724,4
80725,"I love this ring, but it came in bad packaging.",80725,4
80725,should've came with a box.,80725,4
80725,"its very beautiful, and shiny.",80725,4
80725,hope it doesn't rust on me.,80725,4
80726,"I'm 5'6"" and ordered a large, but this was a little more cropped than expected.",80726,4
80726,"The top was a little tighter than the shorts were for some reason, however, it still looks cute.",80726,4
80727,It was very comfortable and looked great but it broke after awhile.,80727,4
80727,It was cheap tho and it was mostly my fault it broke so I don't regret the purchase.,80727,4
80729,"Battery life could be better, but my daughter loves these shoes!",80729,4
80732,For the cost the material is great!,80732,4
80732,It does run small so I ordered a 16-18 when I am typically a 14-16!,80732,4
80733,A little big on me but I also ordered two sizes too big because of the other reviews.,80733,4
80733,Also the skirt is a bit short I'm the back but that could be because I have a bigger booty~,80733,4
80734,"The matierial is a little scratchy, but it looks like it did in the picture and fits nice",80734,4
80735,"The skirt has an elastic waist and a side zipper, so the one size all size works just fine.",80735,4
80735,I'm normally a Medium/Size 8 and it fits perfectly.,80735,4
80735,"The material is a little shinier than I expected, but not horrible.",80735,4
80736,"Pretty, but not worth the 6 week wait.",80736,4
80737,super soft and comfy but is not slim or cut as shown,80737,4
80738,"The wings are nice but the elastic
Is tiny and broke.",80738,4
80738,Be prepared to do some sewing,80738,4
80740,It worked for what I needed it for.,80740,4
80740,It shed quite a bit but after ordering and returning 2 other dresses..,80740,4
80740,I was pleased that it fit!,80740,4
80741,I'd say its a good fit.,80741,4
80741,But I prefer my clothes just a tad larger.,80741,4
80744,"They are very cute, but a little large do to my daughter being so tiny.",80744,4
80745,These boots fit her almost perfectly.,80745,4
80745,They kept her feet dry and toasty.,80745,4
80745,She liked them too.,80745,4
80745,She will not be able to wear them next year.,80745,4
80746,The bag looked very nice and of good quality.,80746,4
80746,I purchased the bag as a gift but he already received another bag so I had to return it.,80746,4
80747,I absolutely loved my ring.,80747,4
80747,The only problem was the sizing.,80747,4
80747,"I always wear a size 7 ring, ordered it.",80747,4
80747,I could not get it on my finger.,80747,4
80748,This watch-winder is easy to use with clear switch markings for the turns per day and direction.,80748,4
80748,When first used it was was near silent but after a few months it is now audible in the living room if there is no background noise.,80748,4
80748,Therefore I would advise it may be too loud for some if used on a nightstand/bedroom.,80748,4
80749,Heavy material bright beautiful colors  Runs really long,80749,4
80750,"nice, but I wish it would be bigger.",80750,4
80750,"other than that, it's real nice",80750,4
80751,These are very good cooling sleeves.,80751,4
80751,"While you may think the black band at the top might be annoying, it's been my experience that after a minute or two, you don't notice them.",80751,4
80751,"I initially ordered the XL and they were a little short on me (I'm 6'2"", 185 lbs), but when I started that on a review, their customer service for in touch with me and allowed me to order another pair.",80751,4
80751,I ordered the XXL and they fit great.,80751,4
80751,I rated them a 4 instead of a 5 because I'm not a fan of the seam.,80751,4
80751,"It's not really annoying, it's just another place where the sleeve could possibly separate.",80751,4
80751,"I would recommend these, but I also recommend you buy a size larger than you think.",80751,4
80751,"BTW, if you're looking for a compression sleeve, that is not what this is.",80751,4
80752,Was good for the price i paid,80752,4
80753,Its a great cap!,80753,4
80753,"I love it,  the size fits perfect even for my over sized head (8).",80753,4
80753,I wear this all the time.,80753,4
80753,The brim is pretty stern so it doesn't bend much.,80753,4
80753,I will say I did not like is the interior of the cap.,80753,4
80753,It looks like it has some form of insulation that is looks kind of weird but it fits great.,80753,4
80753,The color is also more of a dark gray than black.,80753,4
80755,Fits great and is comfortable.,80755,4
80756,Had to return it as it was too tight around the bust.,80756,4
80756,Other than the fit was perfect and I really like the pretty deep red color.,80756,4
80756,"It was a great price ,very affordable and didn't look cheap at all.",80756,4
80756,I usually wear a size 12 and have a 36C bust and it was too tight at the top.,80756,4
80757,sent it back for exchange......very fast/efficient,80757,4
80759,This is as adorable as it looks.,80759,4
80759,Cheap so it won't wear well but really worth it.,80759,4
80760,"Nice apron, fits true to size.",80760,4
80760,"A little thinner than I expected, but still kept my clothes clean while cooking.",80760,4
80761,"They were very soft on my foot, but difficult to get on!",80761,4
80761,Once you did then it became easier the next time!!,80761,4
80761,They do work rather good.,80761,4
80762,So soft and pretty.,80762,4
80763,"Although the quality of this is what you would expect for the low price, it is really cute.",80763,4
80763,I get compliments every time I wear it.,80763,4
80763,"It does twist up a bit, which is annoying, but overall I really like it.",80763,4
80763,Shipping does take a really long time since it is coming from China.,80763,4
80764,"I am 5'7"", 160 lbs postpartum, and normally wear a medium.",80764,4
80764,"Purchased a medium, which is very snug and slightly shorter than I would have preferred.",80764,4
80764,"But the material is comfortable, and it hooks well into my nursing bras.",80764,4
80764,can unhook easily with one hand.,80764,4
80764,Will likely purchase more in the future.,80764,4
80765,"I should have listened to the other reviews and ordered a band size larger than my typical order but I didn't, The band did fit and the cups are the perfect size but the band is tight and there is no wiggle room.",80765,4
80765,"I do feel because of the tightness it does help to hold up ""the girls"" a little better.",80765,4
80765,Being a 32DDD since I got pregnant these swimsuit tops have saved my life.,80765,4
80765,They help to make you feel held in and not spilling over everywhere.,80765,4
80765,I do highly recommend them.,80765,4
80766,Super cute standard legging.,80766,4
80766,Does smell like black dye.,80766,4
80767,The straps were too long and so once we took those out it was perfect.,80767,4
80768,Fits comfortably and is very colorful.,80768,4
80769,"This is soo cute, though it is a little big for my 1 yr old.",80769,4
80769,He can definitely still use it for the next winter,80769,4
80770,"Very cute, but also pretty see through.",80770,4
80770,"Plan on wearing a slip, or something underneath.",80770,4
80770,"I wore a white tank top and shorts, and it worked out great!",80770,4
80771,got these for the water park.,80771,4
80772,These were perfect for our Nina family Halloween!,80772,4
80772,The only downside for me was the bottoms were pantyhose-tights!,80772,4
80772,So I wore my own tight black leggings and got lots of compliments.,80772,4
80772,We looked awesome !,80772,4
80772,InCharacter costumes are ALL I've ever purchased!,80772,4
80772,I will keep that tradition going!,80772,4
80772,Keep the quality going InCharacter!,80772,4
80773,This top is an extremely textbook definition of a crop top.,80773,4
80773,I have 36c's and this top hits at the top of my rib cage.,80773,4
80773,"As with most American Apparel clothing, there is very little room for hiding and body forgiveness.",80773,4
80773,"If you're not concerned about that or do not have any body issues, by all means: go for it!",80773,4
80773,"It is a beautiful color, fabric and great for the summer!",80773,4
80774,I'm having hard time ironing it; otherwise good product for a good price.,80774,4
80775,It does what it claims.,80775,4
80775,Easy on and easy off.,80775,4
80776,Like it but colors off.,80776,4
80778,"Need a very small wrist to wear this, otherwise it is very pretty and looks great on my young Grandaughter.",80778,4
80779,The colors are not as bright as in the picture.,80779,4
80779,The material feels good.,80779,4
80779,It's not a see through one.,80779,4
80779,My measures are: waist 25in and hips 36in.,80779,4
80779,It fits me right.,80779,4
80779,"And I am 5""6' tall.",80779,4
80780,Really loving how this looks and it's very comfortable.,80780,4
80780,Bigger then it thought it would be but honestly that's no biggie.,80780,4
80780,"Been a while that I've had this, the gem has fallen out and the ring has started turning green",80780,4
80781,The straps are a little big for my daughter's ankles but doesn't look bad.,80781,4
80782,"I like the product,  but the size chart is incorrect, This Item is to small!",80782,4
80782,If your ordering you may need to get two sizes larger,80782,4
80784,The dress is really nice but it is Too large.,80784,4
80785,Great piece of jewelry for the price.,80785,4
80785,It's obviously not solid gold but in a dark setting from several feet away it looks close enough that it will leave people wondering if it really is...That's enough for me.,80785,4
80786,"I should probably give this 3 stars as I'm a little worried about it's durability, but so far it has worked great and my daughter loves it.",80786,4
80787,"Not sure if it fot small due to the inner lining or because im ""shaped"" American (African American, to boot).",80787,4
80787,I would suggest getting this item 2 sizes bigger than normal to accomodate a sweater or if not then one size larger for a thin shirt.,80787,4
80789,It runs a size large but great quality,80789,4
80790,"Very nice, fits well.",80790,4
80790,Looks great with a cravat.,80790,4
80791,I am 103 pounds 5'3 so x-small fits me well.,80791,4
80791,"It's not perfect, but I did pay only $11.00 so can't complain.",80791,4
80791,It's sheer so you will have to wear something underneath.,80791,4
80791,I like how it's colorful~ Give a bit of life to a plain colored skirt.,80791,4
80792,It is a ok hat.,80792,4
80793,Perfect in every way!,80793,4
80793,"For some reason the coral color fabric is the most comfortable of all the colors :) but it does have less of the ""sucking in"" power.",80793,4
80793,"The black, burgundy, and gray ones are way tighter than the coral and are a little scratchier on the edges between legs.",80793,4
80793,"All fit great, just some colors are more for a comfort day, some colors are more for a day you need support.",80793,4
80794,"The quality is somewhat great, however one of them ripped alrewady after two days as I was trying to take it off.",80794,4
80795,"not a loose fit ,kinda tight",80795,4
80796,It was a pretty cute wig.,80796,4
80796,"Only bad thing is because of the material, it knotted easily.",80796,4
80796,"All in all, still cute!",80796,4
80797,I wanted a pair of Burgundy leather gloves but didn't want to splurge since I won't be wearing them as often as Black.,80797,4
80797,These gloves are a great value for the price.,80797,4
80797,The leather is soft and the color is vibrant.,80797,4
80797,They have a fleece lining which I was expecting.,80797,4
80797,If you look at the description they state the the available linings are fleece and cashmere and to message them for custom made gloves.,80797,4
80797,I assumed that fleece was the default at that price point.,80797,4
80797,Based on the reviews saying the gloves run small I decided to purchase a Large.,80797,4
80797,The hand fits perfect but I have some extra room at the tips on the fingers.,80797,4
80798,I love the print and it's super brights and cute!,80798,4
80798,I am pear shaped so my thighs and booty are obvs bigger than my waist and chest.,80798,4
80798,"so while it fit perfectly everywhere else, the breast area fit me a bit big but taking out the underwire helped to make the cup fit.",80798,4
80798,"I am 5'4 ,185 lbs 36b.",80798,4
80799,Runs a little on small side for size ....but a nice shirt.,80799,4
80800,"I ordered it in red and it feels good and looks good too, with lots of room, even for my cell phone!.",80800,4
80800,I trust Amazon's products so I hope it does what it's suppose to do and keep the hackers at bay.,80800,4
80801,A little small for a large but otherwise as described.,80801,4
80803,The pins are exactly what I hoped for!,80803,4
80803,I think my SO will love them.,80803,4
80803,The pins are well done and I appreciate the thought that went into this item.,80803,4
80803,I'm very happy in general with this decision.,80803,4
80803,"That being said, they lost a star because the pin box arrived in a soft plastic shipping bag.",80803,4
80803,Which means that the cardboard case that the pins arrived in wasn't well protected.,80803,4
80803,The edges are kinda banged up so it doesn't have a great presentation anymore which is half the fun of a really cool gift.,80803,4
80803,"Overall, love the pins.",80803,4
80803,Wish it had been shipped in better packaging but I believe it is still worth buying.,80803,4
80804,Thin but ok for the price,80804,4
80805,It's cute but very open in the front.,80805,4
80805,You could really benefit from double sided tape or a cute bandeau to wear under.,80805,4
80805,I was worried about being see through but it's surprisingly not.,80805,4
80805,Make sure to check the size chart as I think it runs a little smaller than normal.,80805,4
80807,I love the pajamas but they ran small,80807,4
80808,Just as expected considered a good deal,80808,4
80809,I am amazed at the attention to detail that this pair of glasses has I also bought another pair for a gift and another style that this company offers.,80809,4
80809,Highly recommend for quality and affordable price is a huge factor.,80809,4
80810,well made and cleans up well from active child.,80810,4
80811,These are the best boxers around.,80811,4
80811,I am a power lineman working outside hanging on a pole all day.,80811,4
80811,The work is usually straining so I'm constantly sweating.,80811,4
80811,These are a life savor.,80811,4
80811,I have also ran in a few mud runs and have had no chaffing.,80811,4
80812,"return policy means i begrudgingly kept this piece, it is well made, utilitarian, and looks more expensive and worn in just right",80812,4
80814,They fit ad expected but very uncomfortable and the fabric digs into my toes on the end.,80814,4
80814,But they're super cute and looked like the picture!,80814,4
80815,Yay cold weather running here I come.,80815,4
80816,Cute dress perfect for work.,80816,4
80816,"I'm 5'2"" and it hits me at the knee.",80816,4
80817,This is going to be tough for me to review.,80817,4
80817,I really like the bracelet and being able to have my hair tie handy with out sacrificing my circulation in my wrist.,80817,4
80817,"But for this one, works great if you only use the little or narrow hair ties.",80817,4
80817,None of the wider hair ties will stay on the holder.,80817,4
80817,"I have very VERY long hair, and I normally use the little wider hair ties.",80817,4
80817,But I really like the hair tie holder so I will get use to the littler hair ties.,80817,4
80818,for my elderly mom and she loves it.,80818,4
80819,I really like My belt.,80819,4
80820,I wanted a medium and when it came it is M/L so it is a little too big.,80820,4
80821,I really love this swim bra.,80821,4
80821,It covers well and is comfortable...but it runs really big.,80821,4
80821,"I was able to alter the one I bought, and I took it in several inches to get it to fit right.",80821,4
80821,"Because of that, I had to deduct a star.",80821,4
80821,Consider going down 1-2 full sizes than what you might expect.,80821,4
80821,Remember this is made from a swimsuit fabric so it stretches.,80821,4
80821,"It also has bra cups sewn in which are great, once you get sized right.",80821,4
80821,The bra cups also help with modesty issues (think cold water!).,80821,4
80821,I ordered a 3X based on the size chart (I wear a 24 usually) and was I 'swimming' it -- but not in a good way.,80821,4
80821,It was far too large.,80821,4
80821,"If I were to order again, I'd get a 1X.",80821,4
80822,"Made to fit a women , not men's jeans",80822,4
80826,I actually have a somewhat large sized chest.,80826,4
80826,"I wear size L shirts,sometimes XL depending on the shirt.",80826,4
80826,I wear an XL in binders (such as Underworks/GCB2) most of the time so I was nervous buying the XXL initially even though Asian sizes run small.,80826,4
80826,"It arrived today,after a little help from my girlfriend I finally got it on,and I must say that I am surprised with how comfortable and breathable it is!",80826,4
80826,It doesn't even feel like I'm wearing a binder!,80826,4
80826,It works pretty well!,80826,4
80826,Would definitely recommend one of these for people on a budget.,80826,4
80826,It works just as well as the brand name binders in my opinion!,80826,4
80827,"Im a size 4 and didn't fit , my 10 th year old daugther keep them they are really cute but super smal",80827,4
80828,"I'm 5'7"", 100lbs, B size cup, and normally wear size small or extra small.",80828,4
80828,After reading reviews decided to order Medium size and it fits great.,80828,4
80828,"The quality is not the  best, but once it's on, the print and everything looks pretty nice, the colors and pattern pretty true to the picture, It also feels comfortable.",80828,4
80830,I am really happy I went ahead and bought this.,80830,4
80830,"At 14 weeks pregnant I could still fit in my jeans, but my work pants were a problem.",80830,4
80830,This worked very well to keep my pants in place so I can delay buying maternity work pants since they don't really come in long sizes.,80830,4
80830,"I really like the grippy band at the bottom, prevented the band from rising up.",80830,4
80831,Liked the shirt once is arrived.,80831,4
80831,Ordered this shirt to take on mission trip and paid extra shipping to get it in time but did not arrive as expected.,80831,4
80832,"Good quality, adorable outfit.",80832,4
80832,"Rather large considering it's a small, but not a deal-breaker.",80832,4
80832,Arrived when I expected.,80832,4
80832,I would order from this seller again.,80832,4
80833,I really like them but they are too big for my ears.,80833,4
80833,I ordered the small size and hope that they fit better.,80833,4
80833,These fall off if I move but I still like them and can't wait to get the new ones.,80833,4
80834,The top was super cute and the fabric is soft and lightweight.,80834,4
80834,The only issue I had was that it is TOO small.,80834,4
80834,"I ordered a large just because I know that asian sizing runs really small, but this shirt did not fit at all!",80834,4
80834,I gave it to my 10 year old daughter and it fit her perfectly.,80834,4
80835,Runs a little bit large.,80835,4
80835,Otherwise It will work.,80835,4
80836,I have a long torso.,80836,4
80836,This outfit shows camel toe look and pulls to much at the shoulders.,80836,4
80836,I feels comfy but it keeps riding up the leg.,80836,4
80837,Runs small but I love the design on it.,80837,4
80837,This is a very thin hoodie.,80837,4
80838,"After having my order messed up, i got this clutch that i had previously ordered and found that it was a beautiful handbag.",80838,4
80838,Too bad I will not get to see the  gold tone one i had reordered for this one.,80838,4
80839,fit perfectly and nice lightweight jacket.,80839,4
80839,quality is not great but its decent.,80839,4
80840,Love the look of this tank on my son.,80840,4
80840,"At 41 inches and 37 lbs , this shirt fit my 2.5 yr old well, tiny bit short but width was good in 4t.",80840,4
80840,"The vivid colors didn't hold up 100% in the wash not all the car prints, looks very lived in quickly but I still like it a lot.",80840,4
80841,I liked it just make sure you read size chart runs big,80841,4
80842,"I am 5'8"" , 32"" waist,Size runs smaller , to compensate I purchased XL size and it fits me good , not loose not too tight , comfortable and color is awesome.",80842,4
80842,"One thing you should know the material is synthetic and you will fill even slightest wind blow or change of temperature, it fills like when you shave parts of your body that you never shaved before...",80842,4
80842,I don't thick it would be good idea for keeping you warm as underwear but more as pajamas alternative.,80842,4
80842,I give 4 stars because I don't really like this sensation of filling temperature.,80842,4
80843,and the collar has AWESOME stretchy material so you don't piss off your kiddo putting their shirt on.,80843,4
80843,BUT this outfit is HUUUUGEEE.,80843,4
80843,We'll be holding on to it for quite some time before it will fit.,80843,4
80844,"I'm 5'4, 125 lbs, 34D.",80844,4
80844,I would normally order a small but due to reviews here I ordered a medium.,80844,4
80844,The skirt fit perfect but the top was a little bit tight.,80844,4
80844,I still wore it.,80844,4
80844,It was only slightly tight.,80844,4
80844,But I'd recommend a large if you have a size D bust size.,80844,4
80844,The outfit is cute and the material is soft.,80844,4
80844,"Besides the sizing issue, my other major concern is that it had a slight flaw in the lace on the shirt about 1 inch long.",80844,4
80844,I only noticed it when i was ironing.,80844,4
80844,Probably nobody else even notices.,80844,4
80844,It was like a section got missed during construction of the skirt.,80844,4
80844,I got a lot of compliments on it.,80844,4
80844,It was the dress I wore after my wedding in Vegas...because who wants to wear their wedding dress in a casino?,80844,4
80844,It worked perfectly for what i wanted it for.,80844,4
80844,I would consider another product by this company but be very careful of sizing.,80844,4
80845,"Loved this dress in color and fit; however, my hair kept getting snagged by the chain and was ouch.",80845,4
80845,Wish they used a different gold chain.,80845,4
80846,a little blousy in the chest area but fits otherwise.,80846,4
80846,I like the material and the construction.,80846,4
80846,Also bought the 3x size and have the same things to say about the fit.,80846,4
80847,I loved the blouse but it was snug in my arms.,80847,4
80848,"I ordered a large, usually my size.",80848,4
80848,"After recieving it, I gave it to my wife and ordered a double xl because they run so small.",80848,4
80848,"It fits snugly, but I do like the design!",80848,4
80849,Cute but smaller then expected.,80849,4
80850,Kinda feels like scuba gear.,80850,4
80851,I replaced jump ring with a sturdier jump ring.,80851,4
80852,It is exactly what I expected.,80852,4
80852,I did buy it when it was a bit more expensive and later found it at Sears for a more comfortable price.,80852,4
80852,Overall it works great as a diaper bag for my toddler.,80852,4
80853,Good quality just got the wrong size,80853,4
80854,Love this T-shirt but it does run a half size small.,80854,4
80854,Material is rather thin so its great for hot summer days.,80854,4
80855,"I fit in a XL easily, but I needed a XXXL!",80855,4
80855,"Once I found a size to fit, I was pleased with the performance.",80855,4
80856,Nicer than pictured and very cute.,80856,4
80856,Mine seemed to be well made and study.,80856,4
80856,"However, it is very very large!",80856,4
80856,I gave it as a gift and it barely stayed on my friend's arm.,80856,4
80857,Goes with many things.,80857,4
80857,Comfortable with a somewhat snug fit for the ability to complete computer tasks without the hassle of removing it and remembering to put it back on.,80857,4
80857,Have not worn it enough to suggest the durability however it is lower priced item.,80857,4
80859,"Overall, I like this rain jacket.",80859,4
80859,"I got mine in black, and the color is just as expected.",80859,4
80859,"The waterproof quality is also a nice step up from my old, water ""resistant"" rain coat, so I love that this one keeps me much drier.",80859,4
80859,"There is velcro you can snap closed over the zipper to keep water from leaking in that way - or, if it's just a light rain, I just don't even fool with the zipper and just velcro it when I'm in a rush.",80859,4
80859,I love this feature.,80859,4
80859,There's also velcro around the wrist to be adjusted to keep water out of your sleeves.,80859,4
80859,The one con is the size.,80859,4
80859,It fits me great everywhere but right at the bottom.,80859,4
80859,"When using the zipper, it's a little snug in my hip area.",80859,4
80859,"It wasn't bad enough that I needed to return it, but if you have wide hips, it may be too snug for you.",80859,4
80859,Just be aware of this.,80859,4
80859,"Everywhere else, though, the fit is fine.",80859,4
80859,"Overall, for the price and quality I do like the jacket, so I'm pleased with the purchase.",80859,4
80860,these are tooooo cute,80860,4
80862,For my daughter very comfortable and the length is perfect for her tiny frame.,80862,4
80863,My best dress strap for my Apple watch 2 !,80863,4
80863,"I love the quality , fit and compliments that I get every time I wear it!",80863,4
80864,This romper fit just fine.,80864,4
80864,I would rank it 3 stars based on quality however for the price gave it 4.,80864,4
80864,"It is pretty thin material, almost see through.",80864,4
80864,The lining inside is much shorter than hte lace it almost looks like underwear hanging out.,80864,4
80865,The only negative is the part that goes around your neck does hurt a bit.,80865,4
80865,It is worth the discomfort.,80865,4
80866,"No coverage, completely sheer from top to bottom, but sexy.",80866,4
80866,I'm 5'5 and it grazes my ankles.,80866,4
80867,"We bought a size up, anticipating it would not be true to size and it worked out fine!",80867,4
80867,She won best dressed for superhero night at her youth conference!,80867,4
80868,"After reading reviews, I ordered a small.",80868,4
80868,"I'm 5'5, 137 lbs, & a 36D.",80868,4
80868,I'm a size 6 but hour glass shaped.,80868,4
80868,The dress fits good.,80868,4
80868,You will definitely need a push up bra or something because it's not real piping and is a velour cover more than a bodice.,80868,4
80868,The skirt is short as expected and I will be wearing some type of boy short or something underneath.,80868,4
80868,The belt does not fit at all!,80868,4
80868,It fits my head and is essentially the same length as the head band!,80868,4
80868,The silver arm bands are fairly cheesy.,80868,4
80868,Almost look like they belong to an astronaut costume.,80868,4
80868,I think I may try to make my own if I have time.,80868,4
80868,The boot covers aren't great.,80868,4
80868,They are really long but could be tucked in.,80868,4
80868,"The material is transparent but on top of boots, that wouldn't matter.",80868,4
80868,I don't think they will stay on though as there is no elastic in the toe to keep them in place.,80868,4
80868,"There is a strap that goes underneath, but it was still loose for me.",80868,4
80868,I think I'll end up spray painting a pair of boots I use for costumes anyway.,80868,4
80868,"The cape is made of polyurethane foam, it seems like it all is, but will work fine.",80868,4
80868,I ordered this for my sons 6th birthday as he wanted a Halloween birthday party.,80868,4
80868,All in all I think it's cute & will work for what I need with some minor modifications.,80868,4
80869,"I came fast and it was what I expected for the price, just saber had a small broken part, which prevents the saber out.",80869,4
80869,But for this excellent disguise.,80869,4
80870,I followed the size chart but could have gone a size smaller so that I would have more use of the correct size.,80870,4
80871,Cute for open back tops.,80871,4
80872,Dress is beautiful and fits fine.,80872,4
80872,Only issue is that the zipper is VERY hard to zip up over all the gathered fabric at the bust line.,80872,4
80872,It's a plastic zipper and I'm afraid that it will break every time I pull it up.,80872,4
80872,But so far so good.,80872,4
80872,Just hope it makes it thru prom night!,80872,4
80873,I really like this watch.,80873,4
80873,Is is a good quality for the price and no one else has it !,80873,4
80873,It took a long time to get here but that's ok.,80873,4
80874,Fits somewhat larger....but i love it...i just pin the back with a pin or brooch...,80874,4
80875,I really liked how it looks and feels my only problem is that I had to tight two of the straps on the sides that fit too big but other than that it's perfect and great quality.,80875,4
80876,You have to be careful wearing this piece.,80876,4
80876,The Opel can pop out is not securely placed it every single time you get one.,80876,4
80876,I bought two and 1 the to the opals popped off .,80876,4
80876,Other than that the pieces beautiful well constructed.,80876,4
80876,It is a tad heavy but that should be expected with having a gemstone in it.,80876,4
80879,Fits as I expected it to.,80879,4
80879,Is really good for working out in also and improves my posture,80879,4
80880,"Very comfortable, good quality, soft stretchy denim.",80880,4
80880,"I will be ordering another, maybe in black.",80880,4
80881,Pro's: Good for the price.,80881,4
80881,Con's: But snug around the shoulders and arms could be longer.,80881,4
80881,only fits my weasels feet .,80881,4
80882,Just as the photo.,80882,4
80883,"The bathing suit material was nice, it's not neoprene so you can have the cute design without the heat of neoprene.",80883,4
80883,I got the small and it was too small.,80883,4
80883,The top fit great ( I wear a 32 D) and gave plenty of push up to my girls.,80883,4
80883,The only reason I sent it back was because I didn't know if I could trust the clasp in the back and the leg holes for the bottoms were too small for my legs.,80883,4
80883,"If I had a lower Body Fat Percentage, then it would've been fine, but i'm still working on getting back in shape and being lean.",80883,4
80884,Okay for one I think the picture falsely advertises that you get 2 heart chain necklaces when in fact and just for some FYI you only get 1.,80884,4
80884,And it's the blue one.,80884,4
80884,"However, the blue is a darker color and appears to be more royal blue than sky blue.",80884,4
80884,I'm not complaining about the color swap however because this blue is much more appealing in my opinion.,80884,4
80884,I purchased from LovelyPet and felt like the package took forever to get here.,80884,4
80884,But in fact it wasn't their fought and  it was the shipping companies'.,80884,4
80884,They were very nice to work with because I just filed a complaint and they emailed me right away!,80884,4
80884,And than it came 2 days later!!!!,80884,4
80884,"I mean wow, they offer truly awesome service.",80884,4
80884,Now for the actual product?,80884,4
80884,And I LOVE it... my bad I HEART it!!!!,80884,4
80884,"Haha, lame puns aside...it is a very decent necklace for the cheap and affordable price.",80884,4
80884,"However my Mom won't accept it as a late Christmas gift and had said ""It looks like something you would wear so why don't you keep it, sweetie?""",80884,4
80884,So what do I know about chic!!!???,80884,4
80884,But hey guess what-More for me than!,80884,4
80884,Or however the saying goes.,80884,4
80884,Awesome product.. little iffy on the shipping but it all worked out great.,80884,4
80884,Will buy from LovelyPet again solely on their amazing customer service.,80884,4
80884,I'll add a pic so you can see the color better.,80884,4
80884,Overall I am a happy camper!,80884,4
80884,=D UPDATE: YO LISTEN UP!,80884,4
80884,I GOT 2 NECKLACES!,80884,4
80884,THE OTHER 1 CAME A WEEK LATER AND IT'S A DARK MYSTIFYING PURPLE!,80884,4
80884,THANK-YOU SO MUCH GUY'S.,80884,4
80884,"I AM ONE HAPPY, HAPPY CAMPER!",80884,4
80885,"Overall, I love this shirt.",80885,4
80885,The print is really nice and the fabric is comfortable.,80885,4
80885,My only complaint is the sizing/length.,80885,4
80885,"I usually wear a small, sometimes even an extra small but I ordered this in a medium and it fits pretty comfortably.",80885,4
80885,"But it's EXTREMELY short, shorter than the picture.",80885,4
80885,"It's still really nice, though, so I don't think the length should stop you from getting it.",80885,4
80886,"It's really cute but runs large....if you are a US size large, get a medium",80886,4
80887,I love this product!,80887,4
80887,I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I wish it had a hook and eye closure for restroom breaks.,80887,4
80887,It definitely gives me a subtle lift and I was surprised at how much of a difference that made!,80887,4
80887,The waist cincher is light to moderate and smooths things out.,80887,4
80887,I also have not had any problems with it rolling or poking me anywhere.,80887,4
80890,Need a teddy under.,80890,4
80890,Is pretty with black leggings.,80890,4
80891,Arrived quickly and is as described.,80891,4
80892,Very good for the price,80892,4
80894,However it was extremely short.,80894,4
80895,Good value for price .,80895,4
80895,The top fits great .,80895,4
80895,I jist wish it was a little longer,80895,4
80896,"Nice casual, yet sexy shirt!",80896,4
80897,"Somewhat small, but otherwise very cute.",80897,4
80898,Can't beat the price!,80898,4
80899,The dress itself is adorable and just like the picture.,80899,4
80899,I ordered a Medium and it was too short... (5'9) had to end up giving it to my roommate,80899,4
80900,"I like this bathing suit, but the cups on the top are a bit large.",80900,4
80900,I am going to add a little padding to make the fit more comfortable.,80900,4
80900,"I am 5' 10"" and wear a size 10 and 36C bra.",80900,4
80900,I ordered an XXL.,80900,4
80900,Go by your measurements only; do not focus on the size.,80900,4
80900,I hope this helps.,80900,4
80901,My daughter love it.,80901,4
80901,It looks so cute on her,80901,4
80902,I bought this as an accessory for my son's Kylo Ren costume.,80902,4
80902,"From his point of view,  he thinks it's awesome because it lights up.",80902,4
80902,It does require two AA batteries ( not included).,80902,4
80902,"Also, the ""saber"" portion collapses within itself so that when you swing the saber, the saber extends.",80902,4
80902,An analogy would be like those pill cups that collapses on itself.,80902,4
80902,"It is 35 inches long, but because it's made of plastic, it's not heavy or bulky to carry.",80902,4
80902,"I gave it one fewer star, because the light source is at the bottom.",80902,4
80902,"Therefore, the illumination is not strong throughout the saber.",80902,4
80902,"My son would give it five stars, though.",80902,4
80903,The sizes run small.,80903,4
80904,"for the price, its good.",80904,4
80904,A little big but he can still wear it.,80904,4
80905,I had to choose 1 to get this box.,80905,4
80905,"I gave 4 starts, but I can't figure out how to put it on.",80905,4
80905,"Sorry so dumb, bur there were no instructions.",80905,4
80906,She loves it and she'll grow into it,80906,4
80907,"Fabric is decent, not the best but not thin either, and it didn't shrink.",80907,4
80907,I washed it in warm.,80907,4
80908,The colors are beautiful and the material is soft.,80908,4
80908,I wanted to use them to wrap my hair but they were too small for that.,80908,4
80908,Tgey are really pretty as scarves though so I decided to wear them for their intended use.,80908,4
80909,"I like my
Purchase very much the top is far too short for a top it's a baggy bra.",80909,4
80909,Fits a little large.,80909,4
80910,"Like the way they fit, quite comfortable..... a bit too long, but I can live with it",80910,4
80911,Bought 3 of these for my Grandsons and they seem well made but they are pretty dark; I would call it charcoal and not Brown.,80911,4
80911,The leather does not scratch easy which is a plus.,80911,4
80912,Shrunk in length quite a bit after one wash.,80912,4
80913,This is a great bag if your looking for just a handbag like a tote.,80913,4
80913,Looks exactly like pictures however with the black the inside has cheetah print instead of plain color.,80913,4
80913,The handles don't fold down so can't go for the crossbody look.,80913,4
80913,"Can fit folders, and maybe a binder.",80913,4
80913,"Lots of space, fited my purse, a coin bag, 32oz glass water bottle, hand lotion, hand sanitizer, a little travel note book and still had some room left.",80913,4
80913,But it can be heavy.,80913,4
80913,I tried caring it on my shoulder but with my jacket it seemed impossible and just keep slipping off.,80913,4
80913,But great imitation people leather.,80913,4
80913,Nice and sturdy will hold its shape and have frets on the bottom so there won't be scuff's on the bottom.,80913,4
80914,Look like 1970s but that is what son wanted!,80914,4
80915,Little small but it one of the better ones,80915,4
80916,"Purchased this purse for one of my girlfriends as a Birthday Present, (shes a huge fan of Vampira).",80916,4
80916,The purse came safely packaged in a box with foam peanuts for safe traveling.,80916,4
80916,"The design is very nice and eye catching, unique and the purse itself is lightweight which is a plus.",80916,4
80916,"It has an awesomely detailed bone handle on the roof of the coffin, incase you wanted to just hold it, though it does come with a chain strap.",80916,4
80916,Pictures of Vampira in different poses complete the design of this purse.,80916,4
80916,I would have put 5 stars if it wasn't for a small dent on the roof of the coffin purse.,80916,4
80916,But it's not very noticeable to the eye unless you're looking for it.,80916,4
80916,The design of this purse overall is pretty amazing!,80916,4
80916,A definite must have if you're into coffin purses and Vampira.,80916,4
80916,I've attached numerous photos for the details of this lovely purse.,80916,4
80917,After I got used to wearing them I really like them.,80917,4
80917,The only thing I would change would be darker lens.,80917,4
80917,I am looking forward to being able to read my phone/kindle easier this summer!,80917,4
80918,This is a cute dress for a great price.,80918,4
80918,It is definitely not designed for a large bust though!,80918,4
80918,Really easy transaction with the seller and quick delivery.,80918,4
80919,This is perfect plastic ring sizer .,80919,4
80919,"Contained together, light and functional.",80919,4
80919,"I used it for jewelry making, but great for any need to ring size.",80919,4
80919,"Great price, and the product holds it's shape and value.",80919,4
80919,"I would purchase this item again, and recommend for purchase.",80919,4
80921,Overall the shoes are exactly as expected.,80921,4
80921,The grey color is great!,80921,4
80921,"However, after reading several reviews from purchasers who reported that the shoes run a little small, I ordered a half-size larger, just in case.",80921,4
80921,Turns out I should probably have just ordered my actual size.,80921,4
80921,"The ones I got were a bit ""baggy.""",80921,4
80921,"However, I'm sure that they will shrink a bit once I get them good and wet.",80921,4
80921,All of my previous pairs of canvas Topsiders have done so.,80921,4
80922,Shirt is well made but runs just a tad bit small to size.,80922,4
80924,very happy full floppy and really close to the feel of real fur ball which I own in various colors just not that beautiful cornflower blue color,80924,4
80925,exactly as I expected I am very pleased..I have ALWAYS been pleased with every product I order from AMAZON,80925,4
80926,"These look quite nice, if a little bit small.",80926,4
80926,It takes some fiddling to get the clamps to be tight enough that they won't slide but also loose enough that they won't hurt.,80926,4
80926,"Once you get it on well though, it's a nice touch, my girlfriend seems to like them at least :)",80926,4
80927,Super cute...but extra small.,80927,4
80928,"My 9 years old nephew loved it, he complained later about not having a ""brighter"" light or having sounds... Wich others swords had and I didn't check before buying.l, of course those are more expensive.",80928,4
80930,This dress is very long but I still like it.,80930,4
80930,The back makes your butt look/ appear bigger.!!!,80930,4
80930,So I wore this while being pregnant and got tons of compliments!!!!,80930,4
80930,Bought 2 of these also got the colorful one too.,80930,4
80931,I ended up letting my friend wear it because it was too small for me.,80931,4
80931,It's pretty thick so it got hot quick.,80931,4
80931,But the elf's body looks too perfect with the person's head on top.,80931,4
80932,Very pleased with the quality of the bag for the price I paid.,80932,4
80933,They fit and give me heel support but feels like walking on a big marble.,80933,4
80934,A little smaller than I though but it's cute.,80934,4
80935,She just love them,80935,4
80936,This seems to be made well and is soft.,80936,4
80936,I am 5ft 4 and it is a little longer than I hoped but I still very happy,80936,4
80937,"Fit well, made well, I would like something a little silkier but for the price, it was PERFECT and vibrant too!",80937,4
80939,"The chain and the pendant was very cute, my only dislike was the chain, it was a bit thinner as the picture perceives.",80939,4
80941,"Great for the price, tail end is a little too wide and doesnt tapper off like most ties so sometimes its hard to keep it behind the front of the tie on your chest.",80941,4
80941,love the color and quality for the price though.,80941,4
80943,"Attractive scarf, but the color is not what is pictured.",80943,4
80943,Wanted red/orange but got two shades of pink.,80943,4
80943,Still a really nice scarf and I may buy other colors.,80943,4
80944,Didn't have the belt as described,80944,4
80945,Keeps my ears nice and warm.,80945,4
80946,The link ring that holds the body of the piece to the neck-chain broke the first time I wore it.,80946,4
80946,"Replaced the ring on both ends, just to be safe, and it wears just fine now.",80946,4
80946,I like the piece.,80946,4
80948,Only disappointment was I thought I would be receiving a blue hair tie as was advertisd in photo aide but instead got a red and black one.,80948,4
80948,Seems it's random colors.,80948,4
80948,Have not worn yet but hope it will be comfortable,80948,4
80950,"Good material, but runs small",80950,4
80951,Nice lightweight sun hat.,80951,4
80951,Color should be stated as NEON orange though.,80951,4
80951,My little guy looks like he should be working on a road crew,80951,4
80953,This is a nice wallet.,80953,4
80954,Well made & soft silky material.,80954,4
80954,It's a beautiful color blue also.,80954,4
80954,Make sure & order a couple sizes up because it runs small.,80954,4
80954,"(I generally wear a s/m but ordered a large & it fits perfectly) Some people said it was too short but I like where the hemline hits, it makes for a more flattering look.",80954,4
80954,My biggest issue with it is that it is hard to keep it up on the shoulders.,80954,4
80954,It slips off unless you pin it to your bra straps.,80954,4
80954,"But it does look & feel kinda ""sexy"" & feminine (without being over the top revealing or trashy) with a pretty bralette.",80954,4
80954,"Other than having to pin it to keep it up, I was l pleasantly surprised by this purchase!",80954,4
80955,It is a beautiful gown and I absolutely live it!,80955,4
80956,So this skirt is beautiful and would have been perfect.,80956,4
80956,After reading the reviews I ordered 2 sizes up with the hopes of it fitting perfectly at my waist.,80956,4
80956,I'm about 5'8 and 115lbs and I ordered a 4 I usually order a 0 or 2 in most clothes so I just knew a 4 would fit if not be a bit big.,80956,4
80956,But nope I can't even zip it all the way up.,80956,4
80956,Total bummer and since it came from China I will not be sending it back.,80956,4
80956,I will gift it to someone who is much smaller than I am .,80956,4
80957,"Got here early and I like it I'm 5'5 chunky and I got the large, I should of gotten the medium tho, but it is pretty and long",80957,4
80958,A large fits like a small...,80958,4
80958,It's still very pretty... Lots of complaints on it...,80958,4
80959,These worked out perfectly for our laid back beach vacation...no worries about turning color or any of the other issues you get with some jewelry when you're in the ocean or pool!!,80959,4
80960,I got a size up just in case .,80960,4
80960,I would rather have a big one than too small to fit.,80960,4
80960,"It fits nice the only thing is Masha don't have nose and freckles a on her face on the jacket in front ,  but other than that everything looks good.",80960,4
80960,My daughter loves it already and wanted to try on right away .,80960,4
80961,They did arrive a little earlier than scheduled.,80961,4
80961,They seem to fit well and stay on but I only had them on for about an hour.,80961,4
80961,I think I can get a few uses out of them before the stickiness is gone.,80961,4
80962,Gaps under the armpit.,80962,4
80962,"The front comes also up slightly higher than expected, perhaps due to a small bust.",80962,4
80962,"Straps look good, which is the reason I got it.",80962,4
80962,"It is VERY see through but of course it is, it's cheap and white.",80962,4
80962,I can't remember if this came with pads or if I added my own.,80962,4
80962,"For the price, it keeps up with the fad for strappy bralettes.",80962,4
80963,"I've purchased a small collection of lingerie, and this is my favorite!",80963,4
80963,"I'm about 5'1"", 115 lbs, 34b, and it fits perfectly!",80963,4
80963,It's also super pretty!,80963,4
80963,The reason I gave it four stars is because the lace at the very top is a little scratchy.,80963,4
80964,100% cotton tux shirt.,80964,4
80964,Just wish it was made with a lighter cotton.,80964,4
80965,I love Baltic Amber beads/stones and when I lost my favorite bracelet I opted for this one.,80965,4
80965,Its beautiful and exactly like the picture.,80965,4
80965,I'm considering to buy more for my friends and family as gifts in the future.,80965,4
80965,I'd even wear a necklace of this if it matched.,80965,4
80965,The only con I had is the twist clasp.,80965,4
80965,It's really hard to do by yourself.,80965,4
80965,I couldn't even do it with my teeth!,80965,4
80965,I don't like to shower or bathe with jewelry.,80965,4
80965,"While I'll make an exception for quick showers, I don't recommend allowing it to soak or to swim with it on.",80965,4
80966,I wasn't sure about the fit at first since it's made for a man but it works.,80966,4
80966,It's a bit bulky for a woman's hand so I wear it on my middle finger.,80966,4
80966,Overall it's a nice ring just wished they had rings more suited for female vets.,80966,4
80967,I ordered the same top 2 years ago and got a large... Back then it fit just right.,80967,4
80967,I've gained weight so ordered an XLG and it's really big but I think I'll try to shrink a little.,80967,4
80967,I love the dark blue and cut,80967,4
80968,Good for fun dressing.,80968,4
80968,"Material is not that great but OK, can't complaint for the price it offered.",80968,4
80969,"Wish it bad 2 sleeves one almost laminated, ohter than that pouseey here i come",80969,4
80970,Shoe laces could be longer.,80970,4
80971,Nice but the band is thicker and sits higher than the other ring,80971,4
80972,I liked the size fairly large plenty of room for most of my stuff I'd like maybe a couple more storage pockets well built if you don't pay attention you can put more stuff than you can carry give it a thumbs up,80972,4
80973,Beautiful outfit but it was too small.,80973,4
80973,Planned on returning it but my daughter was able to wear it and she loves it.,80973,4
80974,The dress is somewhat small in the ribcage and waist yet massively huge in the bra region.,80974,4
80974,It wrinkles easy and is not very easy to iron due to the material makeup.,80974,4
80974,"After some alterations and taking it to the drycleaners to get the wrinkles out, it will work nicely.",80974,4
80974,I did get lots of compliments on this dress when I did wear it.,80974,4
80977,Using as a sleep shirt.,80977,4
80978,A bit short for a dress unless worn with leggings or a fitted skirt- nice design!,80978,4
80981,It would be nice if the fabric were a little thicker and more durable.,80981,4
80982,I got this for my boyfriend and I. shipping took a really long time which was very frustrating!,80982,4
80982,But they are really pretty.,80982,4
80982,I have the rose color and my gem fell out already once so it had to be super glued back on but they are a sweet and a little different.,80982,4
80983,I have to get it fixed for me since it is a bit large.,80983,4
80983,Other than that nothing.,80983,4
80983,"Details are just like in the pictures, fabric is good.",80983,4
80983,I think it is a good coat for the price.,80983,4
80984,This is the 2nd time I've bought 1.,80984,4
80984,They last about a year which is not bad as I'm pretty hard on wallets.,80984,4
80985,I bought these sunglasses to replace an expensive pair of polarized sunglasses that broke.,80985,4
80985,"The lens is a little too dark for me at times, if the sun is in your face it can be hard to see out of them.",80985,4
80985,But they're definitely polarized and are very fashionable.,80985,4
80985,I have gotten many complements on this pair.,80985,4
80986,"Not the color of sequin on the top as in the picture, it was a bronze color and wasn't what I was looking for.",80986,4
80986,Return through them was made simple.,80986,4
80986,I appreciate their prompt response on authorizing the return.,80986,4
80987,For the price is not bad,80987,4
80988,Fits perfect I'm 5'5 125 not really curvy got a small have prime so two day shipping I gave four stars because it smelled bad so you will have to wash hope this helps,80988,4
80989,Somewhat small but good quality.,80989,4
80990,A bit smaller than I expected however.,80990,4
80991,I got it in pink and I think I am going to get the green as well!,80991,4
80991,It runs a little bit small.,80991,4
80991,I am a 32C and I ordered a medium and probably should have went with a large.,80991,4
80991,Very nice material and good quality!,80991,4
80994,"Since it's at a very low price point, there is no really big complains here.",80994,4
80994,One problem that I did found to be pretty annoying re the sharp edges.,80994,4
80994,"But, besides that, it's a very nice wallet.",80994,4
80995,"Very nice, but a little snug",80995,4
80996,"I am 5'9, wear a 16 and bought an extra large.",80996,4
80996,The dress goes  down to my knees.,80996,4
80996,I got the flower/bird pattern.,80996,4
80996,"There is a little bleading of ink on the design, hardly noticeable.",80996,4
80996,The material is good quality.,80996,4
80996,You will probably want to use a belt because of the seam on the stomach.,80996,4
80997,This is beautiful and seems well made.,80997,4
80997,"I wear a 7 1/2 "" bracelet and this is about an inch too small.",80997,4
80997,Since I like it so much I will take it to a jeweler to see if they can add some length to it.,80997,4
80998,The necklace is very cute; however it gave me scratches all over my neck.,80998,4
80998,The necklace had a metal that was sticking out at the back of the decoration.,80998,4
80999,"the lenses shade well, little to no distortion.",80999,4
80999,"I wish they had spring hinges, then they would earn 5 stars.",80999,4
81000,"Was a gift to my sister ion law who runs, but overall heard good reviews",81000,4
81001,I expected these shoes to be big on my son but he fir then perfectly with no socks on.,81001,4
81001,When you buy shoes like this you kinda want them to last for awhile!,81001,4
81001,He wears a sz 9 right now and hes 4y/o!,81001,4
81001,"I ordered 10.5, unless he foot grew but i assume not that quick!",81001,4
81001,Also i didn't like the placment of the charging adapter!,81001,4
81001,"Its small but its hard and right in the ankle area, but i found out that you can kind of tuck it into the padded part of the shoes so i am hoping it will be comfortable!",81001,4
81001,Now my son seen these shoes and was super pumped!!,81001,4
81001,They turned all differant colors and also had a strope option on there too!,81001,4
81001,I haven't been able to test the charging or how long they actually last yet as i had to order a new pair!,81001,4
81002,I like these swim shorts.,81002,4
81002,They are good construction and the length is perfect for keeping thigh chaffing down.,81002,4
81002,I would recommend to others.,81002,4
81003,"Nice buuut, you really have to look at the specific spot to use the bifocal.",81003,4
81004,"I am  5'2"" and usually wear a size 6 and ordered a large.",81004,4
81004,"Fit well on top, but the bottoms were still a bit too small, but not enough that I won't wear it.",81004,4
81004,Just feel that the coverage on the backside could be a little more.,81004,4
81005,they last no more than one season but for the price its worth it,81005,4
81006,Keeps my daughters' hands warm and dry!,81006,4
81006,She loves that they change color in the sunlight.,81006,4
81007,Very sexy and somewhat comfortable...,81007,4
81008,"This would be 5 stars if it fit like the other RBX tanks, but it's a bit tighter in the middle for me.",81008,4
81008,"Not a huge deal, but still an adorable top and gets the job done.",81008,4
81008,"I haven't noticed that it shows sweat, so I don't look like a mess after Couch to 5K.",81008,4
81009,I really like the look of this shirt.,81009,4
81009,I'm tall and the sleeves are very long.,81009,4
81009,The material is thin but seems sturdy.,81009,4
81009,I have not washed it yet so not sure how it will weather that.,81009,4
81009,Completely see through but you can tell that by the picture.,81009,4
81009,It runs VERY SMALL.,81009,4
81009,It does not have much stretch.,81009,4
81009,I sized up one size but probably could have gone two.,81009,4
81009,I am normally a small and should have gotten a large because I want to wear it over my swim suit.,81009,4
81009,If your looking for a more fitted look just go up one size.,81009,4
81009,I may order another color.,81009,4
81010,If you have thought about giving a slide belt a try; this one won't cost you a fortune.,81010,4
81010,Don't expect an 80 dollar premium leather belt made from a full piece of leather!,81010,4
81010,The strap is a laminated type of construction.,81010,4
81010,The buckle is a real eye catcher.,81010,4
81010,Looks great on a pair of dress pants.,81010,4
81010,I got numerous favorable comments from people who noticed.,81010,4
81010,Like I said; it is an eye catcher!,81010,4
81010,The slide part works very well; mechanically latches until I release it.,81010,4
81010,As I said; good value!,81010,4
81011,The bust could have been a little bigger and the straps on the skirt could been a little smaller but all in all I still like it,81011,4
81012,Could do with a smother edge along the band but for the price I'm very happy,81012,4
81013,its great but a little short,81013,4
81014,They're not child sizes... before I buy anything online I ALWAYS look at the sizing they have to offer if it's going up to xxxl its probably for us Americans lol so I ordered one for me I loved it.,81014,4
81014,Some of the thread started snagging but for that price what do you expect?,81014,4
81014,I'm constantly having people ask me where I got it and I ordered my mom one as well.,81014,4
81014,I would say go 2-3 sizes up from what you normally where and you'll be set.,81014,4
81015,"I am 112lbs 5""3..",81015,4
81015,I ordered a size up after reading reviews so I got a medium when I ALWAYS wear small.,81015,4
81015,I like the dress but it is very short.,81015,4
81015,Very thin material but you get what you pay for.,81015,4
81016,"I would have given this 5 stars as I love it, however its a bit large, and I have a fat head.",81016,4
81017,Another score with leveret pajamas!,81017,4
81017,"Comfortable, true to size, and didn't shrink in the dryer.",81017,4
81017,Heavier weight material than I expected also.,81017,4
81017,Super comfy and my 4 yr old loves them,81017,4
81018,I really was excited for these and they are really perfect BUT the only downside is (which could just be me and not wearing earrings all that often) putting them in took a while and it hurt since it isn't smaller at a tip like regular earrings but my ears got used to it.,81018,4
81018,So overall perfect and I love them but it hurt to put them in.,81018,4
81019,Worth buying if you need a bag that holds lots of things and can stand up to everyday wear.,81019,4
81019,I would buy this again,81019,4
81020,Held up well and did exactly as I'd hoped for an extended motorcycle trip.,81020,4
81020,"These are snug but not very strong compression, exactly what I wanted for my trip.",81020,4
81022,"Nice stockings, but a bit short.",81022,4
81022,"I'm 5'6"" and they come to just below mid-thigh.",81022,4
81022,"They stay up, but the top elastic band is thin and has a tendency roll.",81022,4
81022,"They are not the same length, but since they come in a four pack, you can find matching lengths.",81022,4
81024,If you are a big chested girl make sure you go up a dress size.,81024,4
81024,My sister ordered this dress and we will be returning because she cant fit into it.,81024,4
81024,Beautiful dress but just isn't going to work for her.,81024,4
81024,I gave it a 4 for how pretty the dress is but not sized correctly.,81024,4
81025,What I was looking for.,81025,4
81026,Nice material and GREAT colors.,81026,4
81026,"However, it was waaaay too short for me to wear.",81026,4
81026,"I'm 5'6"" and 190"".",81026,4
81026,I'm used to the dresses I order having a bit more length to them.,81026,4
81026,If not for the length I would have given it 5 stars.,81026,4
81027,Looks like a seam stitching may be coming loose and when it's fully packed to the top....,81027,4
81027,The top flap won't cover the bag completely.,81027,4
81027,Used weighted to about 70# and worked great for nearly two weeks.,81027,4
81028,"But, they definitely run small, very small.",81028,4
81028,"So, had to send it back.",81028,4
81029,Fabric feels warm and light.,81029,4
81029,Very good for after workouts when u don't want to catch a cold with all the perspiration in an aircon environment.,81029,4
81029,Not sure how it helps as a mid/base layer for winter.,81029,4
81029,Size if just right for an Asian M.,81029,4
81030,I really have enjoyed having this in my wardrobe.,81030,4
81031,the bottoms wear too large i wear a size 4 in the waist and the top was to small i wear a size d cup but not super hard modification and adjustments,81031,4
81032,Nice shirt but material is kind of flimsy,81032,4
81033,Came faster than expected.,81033,4
81033,The material was cheap and snagged easily but it was worth it for the price.,81033,4
81033,I received tons of compliments in this dress,81033,4
81034,This shirt fits really well but there is no care label on it.,81034,4
81034,Also the material is pretty see though.,81034,4
81035,This one was a little tight but I still like it a lot.,81035,4
81035,It is very pretty.,81035,4
81036,"Good quality for the price, but was just a little smaller than expected.",81036,4
81037,Very soft and nice looking T-Shirt.,81037,4
81037,Was very impressed that I received it in a week when the expected arrival date was a month away.,81037,4
81037,"This Tshirt is a loose fit, so if you are looking for a more fitted tee do not size up as I did.",81037,4
81037,It also has a generous length.,81037,4
81037,White is nice bright white.,81037,4
81038,my husband loved it but it is a little small.,81038,4
81038,we used it with a mad hatters costume for Halloween.,81038,4
81038,It definitely finished off the look.,81038,4
81040,very nice fits good,81040,4
81041,THEY ARE SO SMALL!!!!,81041,4
81041,get a size up.,81041,4
81041,They look well made and came quickly.,81041,4
81041,"My feet are small, I wear kid's 2 and 3.",81041,4
81041,"So I thought these as a size 3 would fit me,  but the size 3 is really snug.",81041,4
81041,I can fit my feet inside of them but my toes are getting numb,81041,4
81043,"just a small gripe, but the neck doesn't fold exactly like the product pics.",81043,4
81045,Loved by my 6 year old!,81045,4
81046,Fit as  expected.,81046,4
81047,There's nothing wrong with the hat but it is made in China.,81047,4
81047,I'm not gonna dog the review for something I should have researched but I went and bought an official made in america one after I found out.,81047,4
81049,This dress is really nice but the material is then I would recommend because the detail is gorgeous I wore it with shorts and killed it it was lovely for me,81049,4
81050,I love the dress  only thing is I'm not going to give it a five star because it rips Easley,81050,4
81051,I have to send them back:( they r too small but I own several pair and I love them!,81051,4
81052,Nice quality but not sure why these were priced as high as they are.,81052,4
81052,"Just basic cotton pjs, nothing special.",81052,4
81054,"Super cute, just kind big.",81054,4
81054,Itd be nicer if it fit more snug around the nose.,81054,4
81054,Other than that great,81054,4
81055,The product fit perfectly my daughter wears a 3T I bought a 3 and it fit just fine.,81055,4
81055,It came a day late so she didn't get to take her pictures in it but she did get to wake in Christmas morning in them.,81055,4
81055,She really loved them she got to bake cookies with daddy in them.,81055,4
81055,I will be ordering from this company next year I'll just do it at the start of the month and not rely on 2 day shipping.,81055,4
81056,Great shirt good value !,81056,4
81056,"Compared to many others on line, can' t touch this..",81056,4
81057,Quality of cloth may be a little less than what I expected,81057,4
81058,Pain is beauty for these shoes,81058,4
81059,"I love this dress, it is a classic style and looks very slimming on my curvy figure (I am 5' 3.5"" and have hips and a butt).",81059,4
81059,The only thing I would say is definitely get a size larger and wait to lace it up until you are in the dress.,81059,4
81059,I couldn't get it over my butt with the lace-up back in so I had to have someone lace me in.,81059,4
81059,Slightly constricting in movements and since I'm on the shorter side I had to get it hemmed slightly with heels but it was so worth it!,81059,4
81059,"Also, it came a little later than expected (expected to my house by Mar 9 and came Mar 14) but I also am completely okay with that because it was stormy weather and I had it expedited over here so I had over a month to do any alterations needed.",81059,4
81059,"Overall, great dress and I can't wait for the event to come to show it off!",81059,4
81060,Fits well and keeps me warm.,81060,4
81062,Does run a bit small but nothing to make a huge difference.,81062,4
81064,Fits perfect although I do have smaller hands.,81064,4
81065,It's like other web belts.,81065,4
81065,"It says silver in the title but it's more of a dull gray and is not ""shinny"" or shinable.",81065,4
81066,These legings are super duper comfortable.,81066,4
81066,"In my opinion, they run kind of big.",81066,4
81066,I ordered a large - I'm 5.6ft tall and curvy (I weight 185lbs)  and the large was slightly big.,81066,4
81066,I ordered a black pair of these  in medium and they fit much better.,81066,4
81066,"Note also that these pants are not compression at all, that's the only downside I find in them for working out.",81066,4
81067,"The green is more lime than it shows in the photo, but it's comfortable and fits well.",81067,4
81067,"The fabric is pretty staticky and slightly clingy, so it shows the stretchy waistband of my maternity pants.",81067,4
81067,Unfortunately this means I don't wear this top much.,81067,4
81068,A really nice addition to my closet !,81068,4
81068,"Sexy style , but also subtle & soft.",81068,4
81069,Purchasing a XL due to the fit,81069,4
81070,"Was oo smapp, ub I did fing a good if locally.",81070,4
81071,"Good product, my wife used it everyday.",81071,4
81073,Bigger than I expected it would be but I really like it!,81073,4
81074,Picture was a little un-centered.,81074,4
81075,Great quality boxers and cup.,81075,4
81075,My family loves budweiser so this was a perfect gift.,81075,4
81075,Very satisfied with the quality.,81075,4
81075,"Shorts are more of a thicker material than regular boxers, but it is nice.",81075,4
81076,Not exactly cat eye like i wanted but they will do.,81076,4
81076,They aren't as dark as id hoped but overall a good buy.,81076,4
81076,I really needed these,81076,4
81078,I absolutely love this bikini!!,81078,4
81078,It looks so good on.,81078,4
81078,The only thing is that the bottoms show off a little more butt than what I usually wear that's the only reason it's not 5 stars.,81078,4
81079,"It fit a little small and was a little see through, but still cute.",81079,4
81079,Would look good with nylons and boots.,81079,4
81079,"Knowing this comes from China you should buy, 1-2 sizes up.",81079,4
81079,I bought one size up and I could've bought one moe size up.,81079,4
81079,"Also, the arms don't fit loose like the picture.",81079,4
81079,"The dress also doesn't come off the shoulders, but I also have much bigger breasts than the model and again, I probably should've ordered 2 sizes up",81079,4
81080,"Pretty warm (fleece inside), wind blocking and soft.",81080,4
81080,"The reasons I did not give 5 stars are because they are not touch screen gloves and altough I've purchased the small size, I feel my fingers are tightened by the fleece inside the gloves despite the fact that there are still place left on the outer cloth (you can hold the cloth above the top of the fingers).",81080,4
81080,For women it is a little bit bulky and it is not malleable enough when you try to grab something or to close your hands.,81080,4
81080,"If you are looking for some gloves which keeps your hands warm and is wind blocking, these are awesome!",81080,4
81082,Nice and stylish while not too pricey,81082,4
81083,"Fit good, not too tight or too loose.",81083,4
81083,I hope it really is UV protected.,81083,4
81083,It seems like it is thinner material then most rash guards but I love the design!,81083,4
81083,Easy on and off even in the water.,81083,4
81084,"I ordered a set for my granddaughter and when it arrived one of the rosebuds on the necklace was loose and unraveling, this required stitching on my part.",81084,4
81084,"Before realizing this, I had already ordered two more sets for two granddaughters out-of-state, hope they arrive in better condition.",81084,4
81084,"Most importantly, I am happy to report that all three granddaughters were thrilled with their jewerly sets.",81084,4
81085,"My lover likes it, so it gets 4 stars.",81085,4
81085,MIC or it would get 5.,81085,4
81086,Very thick hot material.,81086,4
81086,U could only wear this in the winter.,81086,4
81086,I am 5'5 and it just bearly goes over my shoulders.,81086,4
81086,It's a little tight getting it over the shoulders but it's good.,81086,4
81087,Arrived 2 days before scheduled to.,81087,4
81087,"At first I didn't like it bc it had no support,  but then realized I could move to the next row of clasps.",81087,4
81087,( I was using the very last row) So I started all over and used the middle row.,81087,4
81087,"And like it so much more...
Pros... came early,  comfortable to wear, his under Simi tight clothing.",81087,4
81087,Con... not long enough for my torso.,81087,4
81087,"Took me about a min to get it on (having to lay down to do it)
So for just getting it & putting it on right away, I'm pretty impressed so far.",81087,4
81088,My daughter looked beautiful in it for her prom.,81088,4
81088,We had to have it altered because it was very long and had an wrist strap added so she wouldn't have to drag the dress all evening.,81088,4
81088,She received so many compliments about this dress,81088,4
81089,These take a little getting used to but they keep my ears warm & don't fall off,81089,4
81091,"The inside top was a bit too small,but it still looks good!",81091,4
81091,It keeps my boobs in and up nice and tight.,81091,4
81091,"The outfit overall i just loooooove, would recommend it if this is your type of clothing.",81091,4
81091,I'm Jamaican so this is perfect for beach parties which are kept on a regular here.,81091,4
81092,It is a birthday gift for a lady who loves dolphins..,81092,4
81092,I love it so Iam hoping she will too!,81092,4
81093,This skirt is very nice and fits as expected.,81093,4
81093,"However when I purchased it, there was a discrepancy in the length which I noticed that they have now fixed.",81093,4
81093,It was originally described as 35 inches in length but the true length is 25 inches.,81093,4
81093,I was looking for a 35 inch straight line black dress skirt and was thrilled when I thought I found one.,81093,4
81093,"If it had been 35 inches, I would not have returned it.",81093,4
81093,Very sharp looking dress skirt.,81093,4
81094,Had to make a couple adjustments to one of the cords that were protruding a little bit we used it for a play and it worked pretty well!,81094,4
81095,This is very pretty and comfortable.,81095,4
81095,Satiny feeling and roomy.,81095,4
81095,"If it does well after being laundered, it will be perfect.",81095,4
81097,Really pretty simple dress.,81097,4
81097,Comes a bit wrinkly so be sure to steam it.,81097,4
81097,The front is very low cut so I wore a tan bralette under it.,81097,4
81097,For a smaller chested gal it should be fine.,81097,4
81097,"Decent quality , wore for a baby shower.",81097,4
81097,Just a fun summer dress.,81097,4
81098,It does the job in terms of holding up unbuttoned pants.,81098,4
81098,"For that, 5 stars.",81098,4
81098,But I found the size 1 to be small and I'm just at 11 weeks... And normally a 6.,81098,4
81098,"Ok when standing but sitting down, starts to get uncomfortable after a while.",81098,4
81098,"For that, 3 stars.",81098,4
81099,Super cute but kinda tight.,81099,4
81099,I would size up unless you like it skin tight.,81099,4
81100,"I like the shirt but it had this funky see through going on ,but i just cut it out and now its super cute !",81100,4
81100,"My measurements are : Height-5'7, Chest-35in , Waist-29in, Hips-35in",81100,4

81102,She can use it next summer.,81102,4
81103,"Extra cute novelty garmet, great transition piece between to wear between  seasons.",81103,4
81104,Can't beat this price,81104,4
81105,I have to say I got the most compliments on the dress it is amazing..however extremely painful the sequins rub against your arms and they poke through in the stomach.,81105,4
81105,I had to sew the front together more to keep my boobs in...I would say this is a wear for a couple hours and done,81105,4
81106,"Wallet is a bit thick, but as its used and warn in we expect it to close better and flatten out.",81106,4
81106,"my husbands last wallet was bursting at the seams, this wallet took some time getting organized, almost everything fit.",81106,4
81107,I love this shirt but GAWDAMN!,81107,4
81107,"I usually wear a large, ordered XL and it is form fitting.",81107,4
81107,"And it seems like the material is kind of stretchy like..maybe if you stretch out the sides a bit it will go back to ""XL""...that's not the case.",81107,4
81107,It bounces back like nothing happened.,81107,4
81107,"If you want it loose or baggy, order 2 - 3 sizes up.",81107,4
81108,They are comfortable light and cute.,81108,4
81108,Be careful as they are see through,81108,4
81109,"Doesn't fit my LO yet as he is 4.5 mos and small, but I expect it will fit in another 1.5 mos or so.",81109,4
81110,I really like the dress but it was did not fit the way I expected.,81110,4
81110,They were very cooperative about my return.,81110,4
81110,I definitely will order again from there.,81110,4
81111,Bought it for My daughter.,81111,4
81111,"However, it fits my granddaughter instead.",81111,4
81111,I would advise buying 1 or 2 sizes bigger than normal.,81111,4
81112,It's a lot bigger then I had anticipated.,81112,4
81112,"I bought this for my mom but she loves it, as big as it is.",81112,4
81113,This is larger than it looks but beautiful.,81113,4
81113,Doesn't  require  upper  ear piercing.,81113,4
81113,I do recommend  great  price  but is larger than it looks.,81113,4
81114,I have long arms so it ran a bit small but I can still work with it,81114,4
81115,"Other than being a touch small, they are great.",81115,4
81115,Might buy another set.,81115,4
81116,"will take a few days to brake in, you may get a blister on your heel if you don't tie them tight.",81116,4
81116,"the blue is not as dark as the picture, but still nice and i would consider it to be a masculine blue.",81116,4
81116,"there is a strap, when i purchased these the picture did not show a strap and i told the seller i received shoes with a strap but they didn't seem to care.",81116,4
81116,"with aggressive use of the shoes, putting them on and off quickly without untying the laces will eventually start to rip the rear rubber flap off so be mindful of that.",81116,4
81116,"awesome shoes though, very sporty, get lots of compliments.",81116,4
81117,Great fit and good material,81117,4
81119,the top was shorter than i expected but i love the swim suit anyway,81119,4
81120,Looks a lot more expensive than it is and I have had a lot of complements.,81120,4
81120,4 stars because it runs VERY small (Asian sizes).,81120,4
81120,I am a USA medium and ordered an XL.,81120,4
81120,The XL fits perfectly,81120,4
81121,Looks good and distributes weight evenly.,81121,4
81121,One of the inner pockets ripped after about 6 months of use.,81121,4
81121,You cant notice from the outside,81121,4
81122,"It is somewhat large, but that is my fault for ordering a sleeve size up from what I usually wear.",81122,4
81122,Also my fault for not noticing that it does not have a true collar to allow for ties.,81122,4
81123,Cannot be worn alone as a dress - but love the material and flow.,81123,4
81123,"I purchased a small - and it is still ""oversized"".",81123,4
81124,Bday present for my girl and she loved it so no complaints from me.,81124,4
81125,Adorable but order up,81125,4
81126,Deliver was later to the APO address?,81126,4
81127,Just a little snug.,81127,4
81129,"The skirt is really cute, its a bit less poffy then I thought it would be but that ok in my book.",81129,4
81129,The waist band is a bit tight but I can just adjust it to make it work.,81129,4
81129,"The craftmanship looks good, the skirt looks great!",81129,4
81131,Very delicate and lovely ear vines.,81131,4
81131,I received many compliments when wearing them.,81131,4
81131,The only wish I have is that they would be a bit larger and stand out more.,81131,4
81131,I had no problem bending them to put them on and take them off.,81131,4
81131,"I say ""received"" many compliments as a friend like them so much - I put them on her and let her have them.",81131,4
81132,"really pretty and ""spectacular.""",81132,4
81132,it is quite heavy so be prepared!,81132,4
81135,I'm usually an 18 so I purchased the largest size just in case.,81135,4
81135,It was a little roomy but comfortable.,81135,4
81135,"One downside, there's absolutely no support in the breast area.",81135,4
81135,I expected some underwire to lift a little bit but it's just elastic under the breasts.,81135,4
81135,Unless you have amazing perky boobs or smaller on top don't expect it to look like the picture.,81135,4
81135,I'm a 44DD and it fit fine just didn't have the lift I had hoped for.,81135,4
81135,It's a bit itchy in the lace areas but that could just be me and my skin.,81135,4
81135,"Overall I was happy with it, it is flattering on and my hubs liked it so that's what counts lol",81135,4
81136,very nice t shirt,81136,4
81137,My great granddaughter loved the sparkle shoes and put them on during her birthday party.,81137,4
81137,they looked so cut with her Princess Ariel dress.,81137,4
81138,I bought this as a gift and it fit true to size except it should be noted that it seems also made as a LONG- as it for long torsos.,81138,4
81138,It was received well and is now beloved.,81138,4
81138,It's pretty true to the picture and if you like armadillos... there's absolutely no reason to hold off on buying this.,81138,4
81139,adorable on my 14 year old daughter.,81139,4
81139,"Shes 5'9"" and 125 lbs.",81139,4
81139,"Lacing up the back was challenging, but we did it.",81139,4
81139,"It could have used another 1/2"" of room in the back.",81139,4
81139,it was short but not TOO short for my tall girl.,81139,4
81140,Super cute and I can't wait to use this on my little girl!,81140,4
81143,Very beautiful and looks just as pictured!!!,81143,4
81143,I am so happy i was not disappointed.,81143,4
81143,an undershirt is needed like a tank or something because you can see through the material.,81143,4
81145,Thank you and my husband likes it,81145,4
81146,"Looks just like the picture, and I love the design.",81146,4
81146,"Would be five stars if it had come with instructions, because just like other reviewers, I had to come back to the picture and puzzle it out for awhile.",81146,4
81146,Definitely don't put this on in a hurry the first time!,81146,4
81146,"But otherwise, it looks great.",81146,4
81148,I gave it 4 stars because I was surprised at the quality.,81148,4
81148,The elephant pendant was small but its size is truly reflected on the image.,81148,4
81148,The elephant pendant is removable as well.,81148,4
81149,Not for busty girls but cute anyway,81149,4
81150,Great pants but a little too small in hips.,81150,4
81150,Didn't want to order larger size for fear of being too loose.,81150,4
81151,"Tight, stretchy material, thin, so you can see the shape of your bra through it.",81151,4
81151,"Not like, lewd and obvious, but you can.",81151,4
81151,"Like a very short dress, but you definitely need leggings or pants with it.",81151,4
81151,I got lots of compliments while wearing it.,81151,4
81151,"I had to put on a little cami to make sure it wasn't too much cleavage, and I did have to adjust the wrap around my breasts a few times a day, because it's not sewed in place.",81151,4
81151,"Holds on to wrinkles a lot, so you'd have to iron or steam it.",81151,4
81151,"Disclaimer, I have not tried ironing it, not sure if that's advisable.",81151,4
81151,Fitted but it doesn't squeeze.,81151,4
81151,"wrinkles around the waist make the waist flattering, and the hanging part covers up any tummy.",81151,4
81151,"I wouldn't recommend if you're trying to cover up any chubby rolls because it IS tight, but if you have just a little stomach, it covers it well.",81151,4
81152,We own a tons of drool bibs since my son drools a LOT and these are far better than using a regular bib.,81152,4
81152,"For one, they are much cuter, but they also sit closer up to the chin so that there isn't a lot of space for drool to run down baby's shirt.",81152,4
81152,"They're thicker than regular bibs as well, and the snap in the back makes them more secure than the velcro versions.",81152,4
81152,We own two packs of Adovely bibs and they've held up fairly well over the last 4-5 months.,81152,4
81152,"These are a little bit bigger than some of the other brands offered, which was noticeable when my son started wearing them at 3 months old, but since then he has grown into them.",81152,4
81152,"The photo does make the bibs appear a little bit brighter in color than they seemed in person, but I didn't mind that so much.",81152,4
81152,"However, the bibs with red are more orangey in color than I expected.",81152,4
81152,"We have both the whimsical and the nautical styles, and I will say that the ones with solid coloring have held up much better than the ones with the white backgrounds.",81152,4
81152,"After wearing them every day for months on end, they do tend to take on a yellowish tint where the drool collects, so just keep that in mind when picking out colors if you plan to be as hard on them as we have been.",81152,4
81152,"Overall, they've really helped cut down on the amount of times we have to change our son's shirts due to drool and we get a lot of comments on them when we're out and about.",81152,4
81154,"I wear a 10.5 shoe order a medium, fit me just great like the feel and the fit,the socks don""t slip of.",81154,4
81155,Just arrived so haven't worn it.,81155,4
81155,"It's a little lower in the neckline than I prefer, for what I think looks best at my age (late 50s).",81155,4
81155,I may be wearing a cammie underneath.,81155,4
81155,"It is cute but the fabric is quite thin, altho very soft.",81155,4
81155,"I will have to treat this with extra care, meaning hand wash only, if I don't want it to shrink or pill or worse.",81155,4
81157,The fit is good; they are warm.,81157,4
81157,If the fabric was a little bit softer they would be even better.,81157,4
81157,"But, for $20 they are a great deal.",81157,4
81158,Very nice but somewhat small for a large sized top,81158,4
81159,Just what it was described to be.,81159,4
81159,Just a tad larger than I expected... My bad!,81159,4
81161,My 4 year old grandson told me I was beautiful in this,81161,4
81162,I'm a plus sized woman with a fashion sense some would consider...eccentric.,81162,4
81162,"I bought these because they're freakin' awesome, and seeing them up close has been nothing short of a ""Squee Moment"".",81162,4
81162,"It should be noted that Goddess Sizes may find these a bit on the narrow side,  so keep that in mind before ordering them (and after wearing them for about 15 minutes, I can confidently say that Goddess sizes WILL have issues with the narrowness of this particular style.",81162,4
81162,"To compensate, order one size up from your normal size, and that may help with the width).",81162,4
81162,"These actually do not look all that costumey up close, and I didn't buy them for a costume; in fact I bought them to wear around the office.",81162,4
81162,"They give a nice pair of wide leg culottes, or a flared pair of black trousers a rather sharp and chic look.",81162,4
81162,"Fashion is all about thinking OUTSIDE of the box, and no one said these HAVE to be costume shoes...did they...so, don't be an automaton.",81162,4
81162,"Step off the conveyer belt of popular thinking, and be the change you want to see.",81162,4
81162,"*soap box moment...concluded*

What I like the most about these shoes is the height of the shoe heel.",81162,4
81162,"These have a steady rise, and are therefore much easier to walk in.",81162,4
81162,"I hope this has helped you make your decision, and I wish you the best of luck as you seek out your new favorite pair of shoes.",81162,4
81163,I absolutely love the style of the shoe and wear them for my gym workout.,81163,4
81163,"The arch support is great so they are extremely comfortable to walk/run on, but they are incredibly narrow.",81163,4
81163,"My feet are narrow, but each shoe rubs against the tops of my big toes - causing discomfort.",81163,4
81163,"While the discomfort is not extreme, it is noticeable.",81163,4
81164,Would have been perfect if it's not too short on me.,81164,4
81164,Also I was expecting it to hug tight on my body.,81164,4
81164,But color and style looked just like the pic.,81164,4
81165,Arrived on time love the color.,81165,4
81166,Keeps your shirttails tucked in and doesn't put holes in your shirt or socks.,81166,4
81166,It may take a while to get used to the feeling of a suspender running up your leg from your sock to your shirt though.,81166,4
81166,If you hate your shirttails rising up and sticking out its definitely worth the clean crisp look you can maintain throughout the day.,81166,4
81167,"Good quality, does the job, but does run somewhat small.",81167,4
81167,"If in doubt, buy bigger.",81167,4
81168,"I'm 5'3"" 123lb I ordered the 34 waist and they where way too big.",81168,4
81168,"I love the denim and I love the cut, but they where huge so I need a smaller size.",81168,4
81169,"It's cute but runs small n style is just to short for me... 5'7""",81169,4
81170,This fits great but one of the straps easily broke after the wash.,81170,4
81170,This is a good product just be gentle when washing.,81170,4
81173,"Quality is not very good, but it is worth the price!",81173,4
81174,Liked enough to buy two more.,81174,4
81176,Its a cute swimsuit.,81176,4
81176,it makes you look stunning.,81176,4
81177,I have these in all my shoes now.,81177,4
81177,If I don't my feet start to hurt as my arch begins to flatten out.,81177,4
81177,Great insoles at a reasonable price.,81177,4
81178,however baby's not here yet so I'm not sure how it will fit.,81178,4
81179,The only reason I gave it four stars and not five is that it could use more space.,81179,4
81180,I really liked this dress but was disappointed once I tried it on.,81180,4
81180,"The sleeves are way too tight and the material doesn't ""give.""",81180,4
81180,"I'm 5'7, weight 135lbs.",81180,4
81180,The dress fit perfectly in the length and everywhere else except for my upper arms.,81180,4
81180,And my arms are not huge for my body by any stretch of the imagination.,81180,4
81180,"If your arms are on the thinner side, this will undoubtedly work for you.",81180,4
81180,The only way you're gong to know is by trying it for yourself.,81180,4
81180,It really is a pretty dress.,81180,4
81181,"This is one f my favorite scarves, the color and length are perfect.",81181,4
81181,Shipping took a bit longer than expected but I didn't mind since it wasn't a gift.,81181,4
81182,I ordered the gray large shirt.,81182,4
81182,I am 57 and above average weight with 38 C bust.,81182,4
81182,The shirt actually ran a bit large on me.,81182,4
81182,Going to exchange for a medium.,81182,4
81183,It was fine she likes for cheap jewelry wears them both colors,81183,4
81184,"I wear them out, not to sleep in.",81184,4
81184,they are comfortable and hopefully long lasting.,81184,4
81184,I've only washed them once but I want another pair.,81184,4
81185,Arrived at scene on the photo.,81185,4
81185,The color and if you notice it does huge the model's torso.,81185,4
81185,I personally like wearing baggy clothes myself.,81185,4
81185,But sometimes it's nice to where fitted shirt like this.,81185,4
81185,The only reason I didn't gI've it a five is because of the material.,81185,4
81185,A bit shinier then I would have liked and a little to polyester filling.,81185,4
81185,"I like it enough, I'm going to buy a second one in a different color.",81185,4
81186,The unit works well and seems to be well built for the price.,81186,4
81186,"It requires more than the minimum number of revolutions per day to keep my watch wound, but it is a lot better than doing it manually.",81186,4
81187,Loved the shirt and it fit as expected.,81187,4
81187,The only reason why it is missing a star is because it seemed as if the color faded after a couple of washes.,81187,4
81187,"Not too noticeable, but I wished that did not happen!",81187,4
81189,The dress is great!,81189,4
81189,I am a huge star wars fan.,81189,4
81189,"I don't know how long it will last once it has been washed a few times,
but the price is fair for the quality that you get.",81189,4
81189,"Since I am not a teenager, I ordered one size larger to make sure it
would be long enough on the bottom.",81189,4
81189,"I also found a really cute ""Star Wars Death Star Battle Scarf""
 to dress it up a little.",81189,4
81189,They look perfect together.,81189,4
81191,"Have ordered these dresses twice for costuming and really like them - the material is fairly thick and drapey and soft for the price, and they seem pretty well-made.",81191,4
81191,Love all the color options as well.,81191,4
81191,"They do run super small (I normally would wear a medium or large but have to order these in 2XL or 3XL) and they are pretty short to wear without leggings unless you're especially brave, but all in all a great buy for the price.",81191,4
81192,I wish it came with a sheet that included ways to tie it.,81192,4
81194,Super cute and arrived on time.,81194,4
81194,To be honest it's not very comfortable though its really long and awkward and gets caught on everything but luckily I only have a few weeks left in my pregnancy before I can go back to regular navel rings.,81194,4
81195,"I'm large chested, so that part rides up occasionally.",81195,4
81196,It's beautiful and looks just like the picture.,81196,4
81196,It arrived on time.,81196,4
81196,The only problem I have with it is its so hard get the bead back onto the hoop.,81196,4
81197,It did get an annoying crease in the very middle of the band within two days of use.,81197,4
81197,"I'm a lean (135 lb before pregnancy, 160 at 40 weeks) and 5'8"" with a long torso.",81197,4
81197,"However, the band is comfortable and easy to use.",81197,4
81197,At three days postpartum I needed my husbands assistance in order to be able to fit in it.,81197,4
81197,The next day I was able to put it on my self.,81197,4
81197,"It works like a charm, this was my second pregnancy and at 5 days postpartum I'm wearing my size 4 stretch jeans.",81197,4
81197,I did not fit into my pre pregnancy clothes after the first child for about 6-8 weeks and I was 8 years younger then (late20's).,81197,4
81197,Now I'm in my mid 30s and this is amazing to me.,81197,4
81197,When I went out for a walk with my newborn my neighbors couldn't believe how great I looked.,81197,4
81197,I don't wear it to sleep I'm happy with the results I'm getting.,81197,4
81199,You will need a slip.,81199,4
81199,It's see through but still got great compliments(:,81199,4
81200,The dress is of very good quality material & stitching is great.,81200,4
81200,The color is definitely pretty and not different from the picture.,81200,4
81200,Definitely worth the $$$ paid.,81200,4
81200,I would buy from this maker again,81200,4
81202,Not my usual style but decided to give these a try and they are really cute!,81202,4
81202,"They stayed put pretty much all day until I took a nap on my side, and they didn't fall out- just shifted.",81202,4
81204,I thought this dress was going to be quite a bit longer than it is.,81204,4
81204,"I'm only 5'2"" and it hits me a bit above the knees.",81204,4
81204,Other than the length it's really pretty.,81204,4
81204,"I thought it might be a wear to work type dress but it is really shiny and is beautiful for a good cocktail party, etc.",81204,4
81205,"The fit varies a bit from shirt to shirt, but I love these so much that I own them in half a dozen colors.",81205,4
81205,Great price for a wardrobe staple!,81205,4
81206,Excellent quality but too small for a mans head.,81206,4
81206,Sized More for a young teen.,81206,4
81206,4 instead of 5 only because of fit.,81206,4
81206,Quality and price get 5 stars.,81206,4
81207,The front is really nice but the back is a little flappy,81207,4
81208,Very cute and easy beach cover-up!,81208,4
81209,The pants are bigger than I expected but it's super cute for the price.,81209,4
81210,"It wasn't as long as I thought it would be, but it is still really cute and looks fabulous either way.",81210,4
81211,"While it still fit my son, this tee runs a little small,",81211,4
81212,Good Quality but thought it was a bit larger,81212,4
81213,This is one of my son's favorite shirts.,81213,4
81213,He's obsessed with Dinosaurs and loves Peppa Pig.,81213,4
81213,It's a very cute fun shirt but runs a little small.,81213,4
81213,I'd size up if you want it to last.,81213,4
81214,"slightly big on me, but I have small wrists.",81214,4
81214,other than that I live it.,81214,4
81214,theres also a word on the reverse side.,81214,4
81214,for scorpio its PASSIONATE,81214,4
81215,"I didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't yet washed it, so I don't know how it will hold up.",81215,4
81216,"Definitely on the larger side of the scale which is a bummer because I have a tiny head, however it engulfing my entire coconut makes for a warm one.",81216,4
81219,I like the product but I wish it was little bit larger .,81219,4
81220,This dress was not the same color shown in the picture ad.,81220,4
81221,Comfortable  and stylish,81221,4
81222,Good quality but was a little smaller than I expected.,81222,4
81223,"They do fit slightly small, which is annoying because I suspect that after a dozen washes, they won't fit at all.",81223,4
81223,"Still, good value for the price, and very nice looking as well.",81223,4
81224,just shorting pants  fit fine.,81224,4
81227,I ordered this shirt for a cruise (I live in Northeastern US) and it shipped & arrived promptly.,81227,4
81227,It is very nice and was exactly what I wanted except for one thing...,81227,4
81227,"The label said 4x but it was smaller by far, maybe a 3x or even less.",81227,4
81227,I'm sure this was a labeling error and not a mere difference in fit.,81227,4
81227,"I didn't contact the company for a return or refund because I'm undergoing weight loss surgery in January 2017, and am happy to have this shirt ready for next summer when it will surely fit.",81227,4
81227,It is a beautiful shirt!,81227,4
81228,"They don't stick as good as the one's I've used in the past, But they still do the job.",81228,4
81229,The only reason I didn't give them five stars was that they were a total different color than the ones shown.,81229,4
81229,"They navy, turquoise, and striped.",81229,4
81230,I bought this product for my 3 month old daughter who is in wearing 3-6month clothing.,81230,4
81230,It was delivered within 2 business days and in perfect condition.,81230,4
81230,The fabric is soft and durable.,81230,4
81230,"The hat is a little on the large side, HOWEVER, there is a drawstring that cinches around the crown of the head to meet the size of the wearer, my daughter didn't mind it but her cousin didn't like it.",81230,4
81230,There is also an adjustable chin strap.,81230,4
81230,This is by far the more durable sun hats and beats the cheaper ones sold at department stores.,81230,4
81232,These are really cute and I get a ton of compliments!,81232,4
81232,"The waistband is a little cheap and sometimes get twisted and ugly, but overall the shorts are very fun!",81232,4
81233,"These are very pretty socks, and seem to be high quality.",81233,4
81233,"However, I think they run small.",81233,4
81233,"Maybe they stretch quite a bit; I hope so, or they may not fir my size nine granddaughter!",81233,4
81233,"Love the socks, but I'm concerned about the size.",81233,4
81236,"I knew it would run a bit small, but even a bit smaller than I expected.",81236,4
81236,Still a nice suit.,81236,4
81236,"Just understand that things are very well ""displayed"" wearing this and you should be OK.",81236,4
81237,Super cute and for the price a no brainer!,81237,4

81241,I'll probably buy again.,81241,4
81243,Nice and  good  quality for  the  price,81243,4
81244,I love the style and colors of this dress.,81244,4
81244,I saw that it runs small.,81244,4
81244,I ordered a large in hopes it would be long enough.,81244,4
81244,"It's loose fitting, but the bottom basically shows everything.",81244,4
81244,I will have to wear it to the pool and beach.,81244,4
81244,"I am only 5'2, so I know it's not my height.",81244,4
81245,Looks cool but somewhat of a tough fit since it wobbles a lot.,81245,4
81245,Sure does make a great costume overall when added to other sets.,81245,4
81247,I really like the stainless steel over the aluminum wallets that I have had in the past,81247,4
81248,"I'm a size 13 and the fit is good, but just a tad small.",81248,4
81248,I'll probably get one size bigger next time.,81248,4
81248,Took 3 weeks to get to the US cause its coming from China.,81248,4
81249,"Product looks like the picture, it is really nice and feels good on.",81249,4
81249,"The quality has some flaws the ribbon on the side came off just from putting it on, but overall and for the price it is worth it.",81249,4
81250,Nice bracelet for what you pay for it..,81250,4
81251,"These shirts are light, cool and comfortable.",81251,4
81251,I like a loose fit so I got the XL even though I'm not really that size (honest).,81251,4
81251,Yet I found the shirts just a little too small when first worn after washing.,81251,4
81251,But they seem OK after they stretch out a little.,81251,4
81251,"One odd thing is every time I rub them with a wash cloth and mild natural soap to remove a small stain, a little of the black dye color comes off on the cloth.",81251,4
81252,"I listened to some of the other reviews and sized down (I'm 5' 8"" 170 pounds/curvy and usually order L/XL) and the medium fits me great!",81252,4
81252,I got the black and it's very flattering.,81252,4
81252,I've gotten a lot of compliments on the skirt- I like wearing the skirt with other tops.,81252,4
81252,"I think the top it came with looks kinda cheap and flimsy, but I'm not saying I would NEVER wear it, I just haven't yet... still, it just looks like a sports bra.",81252,4
81252,"The skirt is great because it's super comfy/stretchy, but still looks tight.",81252,4
81252,Really pleased with this item!,81252,4
81253,"Nice style, they have a colorful effect when direct sunlight hits a surface which gives some unique visuals.",81253,4
81253,The color is great.,81253,4
81253,"Kinda flimsy, or on the thin side, but that's the style.",81253,4
81253,Rating it 4 stars because they scratch easily.,81253,4
81253,Really like them so far.,81253,4
81254,Great suit to be active in.,81254,4
81256,"This suit runs small, I purchased the medium and ended up giving it to my daughter.",81256,4
81256,"Other than that the quality is extremely good, and very cute.",81256,4
81257,"Lovely little bag, but that's exactly the problem...too little.",81257,4
81257,iPhone 6 does not fit.,81257,4
81258,"the package was sealed perfectly , the delivery was before the date
I love this cap it has awesome color and perfectly fit with me and my clothes",81258,4
81259,Not sure how good the material would hold up in salt or chlorinated pool water but I'm not of a swimmer anyway.,81259,4
81259,I'm a 36dd so I ordered a 2xl based on reviews and expected it to be big around the circumference of my chest but it was an easy fix with scissors needle and thread.,81259,4
81259,Smaller and they would be falling out.,81259,4
81259,Bottoms are very flattering.,81259,4
81260,Merchandise was exactly as advertised,81260,4
81261,"While these earrings are beautiful, they are so big!",81261,4
81261,I can't wear this around on a regular day without people wondering what the occasion is.,81261,4
81261,It's definitely beautiful though and well worth the price!,81261,4
81261,Just make sure you understand how big it is.,81261,4
81261,See the measurements they have given?,81261,4
81261,Just take out a ruler and see how big that actually is.,81261,4
81261,Will help you make better decision about any earring....,81261,4
81261,"In the case, you think the size is good for you, go for these earrings.",81261,4
81261,You can't really go wrong for this price!,81261,4
81262,A little too tight but hope they fit perfectly soon.,81262,4
81263,Really cute but very cropped... looks almost like a sports bra more,81263,4
81264,A bit large and long.,81264,4
81265,"This took two weeks to come, but it was great to only play a fraction of the price for this trendy item!",81265,4
81265,I attach this to my wallet and my purse and it's absolutely adorable!,81265,4
81265,I'm definitely thinking about buying more in different colors!,81265,4
81266,Very happy that we got a few gloves in every color.,81266,4
81266,Sort of annoyed that they came in all different sizes.,81266,4
81266,"A few could fit an adult, a few could fit a 10 year old and a few could fit a 4 year old.",81266,4
81266,"But other than that, good quality gloves for the price and appear to be made well.",81266,4
81267,For less than $15 these aren't bad.,81267,4
81267,They are comfy and feel like they will hold together well.,81267,4
81267,There is a small pocket built into the front of the waistband which is a small bonus.,81267,4
81267,The fabric is breathable enough although I can't say how it stacks up to established athletic wear like Adidas or Nike but I don't feel like my legs are wrapped in cling wrap or anything awful.,81267,4
81267,The waistband isn't overly tight like some running/yoga pants.,81267,4
81267,No unflattering muffin top while just standing around and they do a more than decent job while sitting.,81267,4
81267,":)

The pink/peach color looks just like in the photo, but when the pants are on the stretched fabric makes the color look less vibrant.",81267,4
81267,I guess it's just how the fabric is dyed because I am not even close to overstretching these pants.,81267,4
81267,"Also, while on the fabric looks like there is a splotchy grey stain...",81267,4
81267,I only noticed it because I was looking for defects like that and I can only see it when the pants are on me.,81267,4
81267,"I thought maybe I got a bad one so I reordered (still have the first pair here) and the ""stains"" on the second pair are worse!",81267,4
81267,They are not very dark but look like I have a bad bruise that is visible under the light peach fabric.,81267,4
81267,Maybe it will wash out?,81267,4
81267,And despite being very dark grey they are still slightly see through.,81267,4
81267,I'm not sure anyone else would notice my panty outlines but again that was what I was looking for so it was noticeable to me.,81267,4
81267,"These kinda make me feel like a sea-world employee, not really a positive or negative, just kind get that vibe while wearing them.",81267,4
81267,Overall good pants for the price with a nice design and fun colors.,81267,4
81268,Perfect length & light weight.,81268,4
81268,"I bought these to wear under a darling tennis dress that is to short, these fix that!",81268,4
81269,Looks great and is very ajustable to fit a baby or toddler.,81269,4
81271,very nice for the price,81271,4
81272,These were comfortable and I ordered the size in line with what the reviewers we recommending.,81272,4
81272,As these go over your swimsuite no one should be ordering skin tight anyway.,81272,4
81273,Just tried it on to make sure it was ok for Halloween Parties.,81273,4
81273,Quality matches the price and I do not expect to get years of use out of it.,81273,4
81274,Will work for my purpose - keeping sun off my ears.,81274,4
81274,"Won't dare wear it in windy conditions, however.",81274,4
81275,"I got a size small and am 5 ft 8in, about 130-135lbs and it was slightly big in areas.",81275,4
81275,A size smaller probably wouldn't work.,81275,4
81275,I like the mesh on my stomach as it showed my tattoo.,81275,4
81275,I love it though and would suggest it to others!,81275,4

81277,It did its job.,81277,4
81277,Has held together well.,81277,4
81278,Light weight and pretty.,81278,4
81279,"It's not bad, but I wish they had one size larger than the one I ordered.",81279,4
81279,"I normally wear a small/medium in US sizes, and the one I got fits well.",81279,4
81279,"I'm not a big fan of the elastic band at the bottom, but other than that, I knew that this would be in Asian sizing, and ordered a couple sizes larger than i would normally.",81279,4
81279,I like it otherwise!,81279,4
81279,It's cute and easy to wear!,81279,4
81280,If you're hoping for spectacle sized glasses these aren't for you.,81280,4
81280,The lens' are about the circumference of a soda can.,81280,4
81280,"I was hoping for something that could be worn on the tip of my nose, but these will easily cover the whole of your eyes.",81280,4
81280,A few discrepancies are that the polarization is fairly weak.,81280,4
81280,There was also a blemish on one lens and small friction scratches on the other.,81280,4
81280,"For the price I cant complain, and it did arrive nearly 3 weeks ahead of time.",81280,4
81281,"Love this top, so cute and comfortable!",81281,4
81281,nice cotton stretchy fabric.,81281,4
81281,"I ordered another one with short sleeves and that fabric was not stretchy cotton it was a sateen, disappointed in that one.",81281,4
81282,"This fit great, there is not to much compression but it still holds you in.",81282,4
81283,I really like this dress!,81283,4
81283,It looks great on me.,81283,4
81283,"I'm 5'9"", 36C, & 160 lbs, it is just the right length to wear to work (the skirt goes down to my kneecaps).",81283,4
81283,"I originally ordered a large, but ended up exchanging it for a medium.",81283,4
81283,The lace collar is stitched down so you don't have to worry about it curling up after washing it.,81283,4
81283,My only complaint is that the bust area is REALLY big.,81283,4
81283,When I sit down the neckline gapes open.,81283,4
81283,I'm going to have to take it in up top at least 3 inches.,81283,4
81283,"Overall, it's still a great little dress, and I don't mind having to do extra alterations because its SO CUTE!!!!",81283,4
81284,I'm a 32DDD and got the largest size and I can make it work as long as I wear a bra!,81284,4

81291,Bottoms fit kind of odd but they do fit.,81291,4
81291,Has side strings so if you are uncomfortable showing your hips you probably won't like it.,81291,4
81291,Takes a while to come from China,81291,4
81293,This is a very pretty backpack.,81293,4
81293,It has sturdy construction and I just love the colors!,81293,4
81293,It is roomy and the front pocket is quite big.,81293,4
81293,I will be taking this tote to a convention so I can't wait to see how it holds up under the rigors of that event!,81293,4
81294,"Nice for the money, but don't expect them to last very long.",81294,4
81295,Glue does not stick long enough.,81295,4
81295,Started to peel away from my skim in about 11/2 hours after i put it on.,81295,4
81295,Then finialy all came off 3 hours.,81295,4
81295,I had bought the Roll on Body Glue and brought it with me and add it to the underside to keep it on until the party was over.,81295,4
81295,"I still use them, i just keep adding the glue.",81295,4
81296,Love them besides the zipper on all pairs I've gotten break within a couple wears.,81296,4
81297,"A beautiful, inexpensive piece with minor flaws (like dried excess glue peeking out).",81297,4
81298,This is my 4 year old daughter's favorite dress!,81298,4
81299,This is a pretty cute top for the price!,81299,4
81299,VERY see-through though so if you get white you will definitely need to wear a tank underneath.,81299,4
81299,The back is completely sheer.,81299,4
81299,"I was a little nervous when I pulled it out of the package, but it looks cute on.",81299,4
81300,Awesome top for jeans or leggings.,81300,4
81301,Nice for early summer and fall when a light jacket is needed.,81301,4
81302,It worked for our murder mystery party.,81302,4
81302,I would never wear this to any other event though.,81302,4
81303,"This is really a woman's jacket, even thought the description says men.",81303,4
81303,"The jacket is a shiny, satiny fabric.",81303,4
81303,It is really a cute jacket.,81303,4
81303,But my husband wouldn't even consider wearing it once he saw it because it is a women's jacket.,81303,4
81303,"So, had it fit me, I would have kept it.",81303,4
81303,It was too small for me so I returned it.,81303,4
81303,"Really, really cute tho!",81303,4
81305,i give it 4 star because the sizes are inaccurate other than that material and design is very nice.,81305,4
81306,"Though it's a little tight, I love the style.",81306,4
81306,No straps that slip off!,81306,4
81306,High enough in front so that it doesn't feel that the water is pulling it down too far.,81306,4
81306,Just the right amount of padding.,81306,4
81307,It is completely see through so you'll need a slip.,81307,4
81307,"Also, I am 5' 3"" and weigh about 110 lbs.",81307,4
81307,I got a large and it is still kind of short.,81307,4
81307,Buy a lot larger than you need.,81307,4
81307,I usually wear small or medium.,81307,4
81308,"But is too big for a newborn, especially the hat.",81308,4
81309,it bends a bit but it still provides te support I needed.,81309,4
81311,It's very cute but it's very see through.,81311,4
81311,I'm looking for a slip to wear under it and then I think I will love it,81311,4
81313,I like it vut I can't figure out how to use the rectangular shaped dies.,81313,4
81313,I guess I have to check out YOU TUBE,81313,4
81314,"Fit well, but I liked another dress I had ordered better.",81314,4
81315,Nice sweatshirt with front pocket.,81315,4
81316,It fits a little big.,81316,4
81317,My hubs and I was going on a 6 day cruise for our anniversary end of August and I wanted a stylish swimsuit.,81317,4
81317,After reading the reviews about how small the ran I decided to get an 5x also (according to size chart).,81317,4
81317,"I'm 5'4, 200, 38C, I should have ordered a 4x instead.",81317,4
81317,It's a bit loose around the bust.,81317,4
81318,Their really good but their just really see threw and uncomfortable so if you want comfortability these aren't for you but they look like the real thing and I love them,81318,4
81319,The tail was too long for a 5 year old.,81319,4
81319,But the swim suit part fit perfect.,81319,4
81319,Only 4 stars because haven't been in the water yet,81319,4
81320,Very warm with multiple uses.,81320,4
81322,"I like this dress, very pretty.",81322,4
81322,Is a little long as I needed XL but didn't see a petite.,81322,4
81322,I am satisfied with this order.,81322,4
81324,"super comfy, love the tall waistband.",81324,4
81325,Definitely cuts the glare but they are a bit too dark for me at night.,81325,4
81325,Good during the day though.,81325,4
81325,Not crazy about the yellow tint but they do work on cutting out the glare.,81325,4
81326,Love this bathing suit.,81326,4
81326,Fits me a little tight in the thighs but other than that it's great!!,81326,4
81326,"Super cute, comfortable, and conservative!",81326,4
81326,Grateful I found it!,81326,4
81327,"I love the look, feel, color, and overall style of this bag.",81327,4
81327,The versatility of the short straps and cross body strap is great.,81327,4
81327,The color of leather is a rich brown and matches so many things.,81327,4
81327,The reason for 4 stars is the small opening on top.,81327,4
81327,It is just small enough to make it difficult to get your hand in and really find something.,81327,4
81327,An iPad does fit in the purse but squishing it through the opening is difficult.,81327,4
81327,The more you use it and the leather relaxes it does give to a bit more opening.,81327,4
81327,But overall it needs to be wider.,81327,4
81329,I purchased one of these based on the positive reviews.,81329,4
81329,"Generally speaking it hasn't disappointed though with a pre pregnancy size of 0, I do have difficulty with my pants sliding down in the back.",81329,4
81329,I work in an office where I am up and down most of the day between meetings and find I am having to constantly adjust it to keep my tush from showing.,81329,4
81329,"I like that it works for all types of pant despite whether they are button, clasp, or other type of closure.",81329,4
81329,"I do find it a little uncomfortable on certain pants, especially jeans with a large metal button, since the closure gets pushed into your skin.",81329,4
81329,I purchase The Belly Button band recently and find it works better with my jeans and some of my buttoned work pants.,81329,4
81329,I'm glad to have the variety of the two types since I find this one a bit better with most of my work pants.,81329,4
81330,Its fits a little to big..I think its just the material..I should have gotten a large instead of XL.Its ok that was my fault..,81330,4
81331,This is a very nice top but I didn't like the way it looked on me.,81331,4
81331,It was too big and I am returning it.,81331,4
81333,I bought this shirt for my sons second birthday.,81333,4
81333,He loves the design and it came when expected.,81333,4
81333,I ordered a 3t and my son usually is a little bigger then a 2t and this shirt was a little snug on him.,81333,4
81334,This product was very pretty.,81334,4
81334,I had to return it though because it was too small.,81334,4
81334,Very easy return process.,81334,4
81335,I absolutely love these earrings.,81335,4
81335,The only thing is they are a little heavy.,81335,4
81336,it is kinda see through...,81336,4
81337,I like it but the clasp really sucks with this type of bead.,81337,4
81337,It not only makes it hard to take on and off but it also rolls on the neck and will just fall off.,81337,4
81337,Got this for my husband who is a chef and it almost fell into the food.,81337,4
81337,"Since I make jewelry I fixed the issue by restringing it and choosing my own clasp, but I really hate beading so yeah that pissed me off.",81337,4
81337,May I suggest using a crimp bead or some sort of lock spacer in between the bead and the bead and the clasp.,81337,4
81337,"That would prevent rolling if you use a different shape and would allow for some room to grab it and twirl to put it on, making it easier on us.",81337,4
81337,I love the beads but I could have just purchases a string a beads and done it myself since that's what I had to do to fix the clasp.,81337,4
81337,"Really pretty hematite and my husband loved it since he didn't have to fix it, meeeehhh.",81337,4
81337,Please go to youtube and get better ideas or test your jewelry on yourself and see what happens.,81337,4
81337,Would buy again if you changed your technique of the clasp.,81337,4
81338,"Very long, otherwise reasonably well made.",81338,4
81339,"Fit fine, just like I like Em.",81339,4
81339,Wish the elastic band was a little more substantial but they are just fine.,81339,4
81339,My husband bought me some others the other day that were supposed to be 12's but they were way smaller!,81339,4
81339,That's happened a couple of times.,81339,4
81340,Fabric is hot feeling.,81340,4
81340,Other than that it's perfect but for a prego it definitely not comfortable when it's 100 degrees!,81340,4
81341,The high waist ban allows for tummy control while looking fashionable.,81341,4
81341,"The material looks and feels like real leather, without the price tag.",81341,4
81341,The style and fit is perfect to catch your girlfriend or boyfriend attention.,81341,4
81341,"Only concern and stopping me for giving this five stars, is it comes with no tags.",81341,4
81341,"I don't know if this should be hand washed, machine washed or dry cleaned.",81341,4
81341,No return label or information came with it.,81341,4
81341,I was lucky in getting the size that fitted me.,81341,4
81341,If I wanted to order another pair I have to research my order for the size.,81341,4
81342,This dress is Beautiful.,81342,4
81342,I am somewhat endowed and Knew it would fit too small... that was easily fixed though with a talented friend.,81342,4
81342,The only complaints I have are that the dress is not true to size and it is made pretty cheaply.,81342,4
81342,"For the price, it worked!",81342,4
81343,Great design and confrotable,81343,4
81344,"Nice gift, product is as advertised and delivered on time",81344,4
81345,"a little tight, but fit ok",81345,4
81346,"Very nice but the LOGO really takes away from the appearance, I would give it a 5 without the LOGO... and probably paid a little more too.",81346,4
81347,"Cute as can be, but it runs about a size too small.",81347,4
81347,It's no big deal for me since I can just put it away for my younger daughter.,81347,4
81347,"Order the next size, other than that it's perfect",81347,4
81348,some of the stitching is a bit messy but I love the look & fit of this jacket.,81348,4
81348,it looks just like the photos.,81348,4
81348,its also nice and warm.,81348,4
81349,"It fitted very well, but the watch it very delicate, don't let it fall!",81349,4
81350,The cap is very nice for the price.,81350,4
81350,Soft on the inside and overall quite warm.,81350,4
81351,"They're not high quality (obviously) in the sense that they do irritate the ears but, oh well, they're super cute!",81351,4
81351,I just only wear them for a few hours at a time like I do with any cheap earrings.,81351,4
81351,These are definitely some of the cutest earrings I've ever had for such a low price.,81351,4
81351,I've gotten TONS of compliments on them when I wore them out running errands!,81351,4
81351,And mostly from strangers!,81351,4
81351,"They took longer than most things on Amazon- but again, for the price what do you expect?",81351,4
81351,"So, unless you're getting them for a specific event (in which case I would definitely order them at least three weeks ahead to be safe) just do what I did- order them and completely forget about it so that when they arrive in the mail 2 weeks later, it's a really pleasant surprise!!!",81351,4
81351,"The long shipping time is the ONLY reason I can't give five stars, and again, it was totally expected and it did SAY it would take longer too.",81351,4
81351,"Otherwise though, they're exactly as expected, if not even a little bit higher quality than I expected (I'm a realist and have - unfortunately - had to learn the hard way about ordering from Asia lol namely China)... Idk... get em.",81351,4
81351,They're really so cute.,81351,4
81351,And it's way better than having to get like 8 lobe piercings- lobes take forever to heal!,81351,4
81351,"HAHA, enjoy :)  (ps- my inner cartilage on the ear in the pic is pierced- that's not dirt or something hahaha)",81351,4
81356,Good quality shorts at a good price.,81356,4
81356,"Slimmer in the leg than expected, but have a nice look and fit.",81356,4
81357,Very warm and so soft around the neck!,81357,4
81358,As long as you follow the sizing chart you will be fine.,81358,4
81358,Also know what you want to wear this as.,81358,4
81358,"If you want it to be a dress, follow the sizing chart and also go up a size or two.",81358,4
81358,"If you plan on wearing it as a tunic with leggings, follow the sizing chart.",81358,4
81358,"If you have a stomach area that is fluffy and you want to hide, by all means, do not purchase this without going up several sizes as it hugs that area.",81358,4
81358,My alumni collegiate cheerleading squad got these printed and wore these to homecoming.,81358,4
81358,They looked great and were super comfortable.,81358,4
81359,"Very comfortable, would buy again :)",81359,4
81361,"The material is a little thin, so you will need to wear a slip under it.",81361,4
81361,I normally wear a size 12 and the large was a little snug.,81361,4
81362,"Great fit n lovely dress just too short, I'm 5'8 and it was too short for me",81362,4
81363,This was perfect for my daughter's Halloween costume!,81363,4
81363,"She wanted to be a wolf, but had very specific ideas about how it should look so not just any pre-packaged costume would do.",81363,4
81363,"She was thrilled to discover that when you press on the nose, it howls!",81363,4
81363,The only minor issue for us was that it was a big too big for her face (she's 8).,81363,4
81363,"However, it did fit her 10-year-old friend, so I guess it's just something to keep in mind for younger kids.",81363,4
81364,"Still having accidents, but these help",81364,4
81365,"I didn't buy this for me, but for my SO.",81365,4
81365,She loves it and thinks it's hilarious.,81365,4
81365,A fun and simple way to lighten the mood in the bedroom.,81365,4
81366,No tags to show how to waash it,81366,4
81367,A tad bit small but loved it!,81367,4
81368,Awesome polarized sunglasses that have lasted me months.,81368,4
81368,"Unfortunately they are loose now so i'll have to tighten them, but they really helped keep the sun out of my eyes.",81368,4
81369,"Older child was needing new bras, these seem to fit well.",81369,4
81369,Just worried they won't last too long.,81369,4
81371,The coat is a little tight at bust and way to long in length but with alterations it will be wearable.,81371,4
81371,Should have selection of 2Xl short,81371,4
81372,I followed the size chart and it fits perfectly around the chest and shoulders and hips...,81372,4
81372,"But at 5'8"", it's about an inch too short.",81372,4
81372,So long as I don't have to bend over I'll be fine.,81372,4
81373,Fun little pieces of jewelry for the ladder of piercings along the entire outer portion of my right ear.,81373,4
81373,"They really are a pain in the butt to fasten, but it isn't a fault or flaw of the jewelry; rather the awkwardness of keeping the correct angle for screwing on a bead that you can't see.",81373,4
81373,"It's not a big deal if you're only putting a couple in, or if you can directly see it.",81373,4
81373,"Otherwise, recruit a helper.",81373,4
81374,"Fades quick, but I wear it all the time.",81374,4
81374,Also rusting by the clasps onto the rope part.,81374,4
81374,"Again, I wear it all the time including in the water.",81374,4
81374,It also rotates on my wrist and the clasp ends up being the part that shows even on the tightest ring.,81374,4
81374,No fault of the manufacturer I guess.,81374,4
81375,This dress is really beautiful and simple..size was as expected I am usually a 6-8 but I ordered a size up..10..and it fits at the bust perfectly but I adjusted it just a little ...love it really beautiful..didn't give it a 5star because its a bit see through had to get a black under garment for it,81375,4
81376,I think it is cute for the price.,81376,4
81376,It is sheer and this so be aware of that.,81376,4
81376,"The white color was not my favorite, but I ordered other colors that look better such as the blue and the pink.",81376,4
81376,I like it is versatile to wrap around swim wear and cover up.,81376,4
81376,The back of it is a but loose because there is extra material so don't expect a perfect fit like a dress.,81376,4
81377,its looking good.i got best compliments,81377,4
81378,"The fit is a little bigger than expected, but not enough to return it for a smaller size.",81378,4
81378,I have long arms and the sleeves fit just right so I don't want to dry it all the way in the dryer.,81378,4
81378,I like that it's light weight because then I can layer when out riding.,81378,4
81378,I like the ties on the side it gives it a nice feminine touch.,81378,4
81379,Those are two important things to me.,81379,4
81379,I'm 100pounds and I ordered the small.,81379,4
81380,I was a bit disappointed that this looked like and iron decal and I hope it stays on through washings.,81380,4
81381,I got them for a cosplay I'm doing in April and was pleased with how pretty they are.,81381,4
81381,"However, they are a bit tight in the upper arm area -I have rather Skinny arms too, but not skinny enough- and the lace at the top had a little tear -nothing too noticeable-  They'll work for my cosplay.",81381,4
81382,"3 years ago I bought the same boots so I thought will be a good idea to buy them again but this one feel like half size bigger, I just have to wear thick socks.",81382,4
81383,Very good quality and exactly like the picture but too small,81383,4
81384,"They are generally small, little but of a hassle to get them on, but look awesome

I'm 10.5 men's shoe as reference",81384,4
81385,"Update: So here it is, 11 months later and I feel it's necessary to add to my original review (below).",81385,4
81385,The wheels are working great and the handle hasn't come apart or pulled completely off of the bag (both of these areas seem to be an issue with many rolling bags).,81385,4
81385,The zippers normally cooperate although they are starting to stick.,81385,4
81385,The straps are still attached and in working order.,81385,4
81385,Now for the not so good.,81385,4
81385,The entire outer area fabric has frayed at the seams.,81385,4
81385,It's literally falling apart.,81385,4
81385,The lining came apart about 6 months after purchase.,81385,4
81385,"Sad to see this happening, because this is a handy rolling bag that I use for the short trip from my car to my desk at work & back again at the end of the day.",81385,4
81385,It's been extremely convenient to not have to carry multiple bags on my shoulders.,81385,4
81385,"If you use this item for an occasional trip out of town (like maybe 4 times a year) it should last you a good while, but it isn't hardy enough for a 5-day work week.",81385,4
81385,"Original review: I got this (in the zebra pattern) to use for work because I tore my rotator cuff and didn't want to make it worse by lugging around a bag filled with lunch & water bottles, along with a purse too.",81385,4
81385,I can easily fit my insulated lunch bag and my purse inside this rolling bag.,81385,4
81385,"I keep my phone, electronic ID, and sunglasses in the smaller side pocket so they are readily available.",81385,4
81385,The wheels are fairly quiet which is nice when I'm rolling down the hallways at work.,81385,4
81385,"I took one star off because the bag tends to tip when going around tight corners, which then yanks on my arm & shoulder which causes pain where I have my injury.",81385,4
81385,"Takes some getting used to, but I'll eventually get the ""turn radius"" figured out and not have that problem in the future.",81385,4
81389,My only real compliant is that there was no care for instruction included with the garment,81389,4
81390,"Fit as expected, soft shirt",81390,4
81391,I bought this top quite a while ago and I am still very happy with it.,81391,4
81391,I get a lot of compliments on it.,81391,4
81391,"It fits pretty big on me, but that's how I intended to wear it.",81391,4
81391,I just give it a little hand wash every now and then and dry it on a very low setting in the dryer.,81391,4
81391,I wear it often.,81391,4
81392,I was a little apprehensive based on other reviewers.,81392,4
81392,I ordered a size bigger I usually wear small ordered a medium .,81392,4
81392,It fits me well and looks good.,81392,4
81392,It does run small so definitely order a size up.,81392,4
81393,Very beautiful but too small.,81393,4
81393,I normally wear  in another brand ordered xxx here.,81393,4
81393,Couldn't get them past my hips.,81393,4
81393,I was so hopeful and preparing to buy more if the ones I ordered worked out.,81393,4
81393,I ordered 4 pairs to start- really wish I could keep them.,81393,4
81393,Again both colors very pretty and sexy!,81393,4
81394,"I ordered a size up because it said runs small, and it fits just fine!",81394,4
81395,"Nice Sweater, thick and fit great",81395,4
81397,"Nice undershirt, wouldn't call it compression though.",81397,4
81398,I bought these for my twins to wear for their 1st birthday cake smash.,81398,4
81398,The suspenders fit great once I adjusted them to the tightest setting.,81398,4
81398,"However, the bow ties were way too big.",81398,4
81398,I didn't like how shiny the ties are in comparison to the suspenders but that's just a minor complaint.,81398,4
81399,Great fitting boxer brief,81399,4
81400,It fits like a sack.,81400,4
81400,However after some sewing it came together nicely and has a bit more shape.,81400,4
81401,Wanted a blue hat looks good lots of compliments price is right.,81401,4
81402,"Straps aren't super comfy, it isn't impractical, but it held up and fits a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 in it!",81402,4
81402,I would probably go for something else that looks similar but has better and more padded straps.,81402,4
81404,I wear it to my workouts.,81404,4
81404,Light enough and comfy for intense workouts,81404,4
81405,i like the look and fit,81405,4
81406,fit well and arrived on time,81406,4
81407,I love the matching wallet and adore the attention to detail.,81407,4
81407,The color is truly stunning.,81407,4
81408,"I have been wearing hair bands around my wrist for years and I've gotten tired of them being too tight, or staying wet after washing my hands.",81408,4
81408,"This bracelet is super practical and it looks nice, too.",81408,4
81408,Pro-tip: Bracelet is too small to go over your hand.,81408,4
81408,"Slide it on through the opening directly over your wrist, then when you put the elastic on, it will keep the bracelet from falling off.",81408,4
81408,Only thing I think could be improved would be to make the indentation for the elastic a bit deeper.,81408,4
81408,The elastic doesn't nearly lie flush with the edges and the elastic will come out of place on occasion.,81408,4
81409,I ordered this for a vintage summer dress found in a thrift shop.,81409,4
81409,"I also ordered the Theresahay Women's Wide Elastic Stretch belt, wanting to see which one worked better with the dress.",81409,4
81409,"The Theresahay's sleeker style works better, so I will use that with this particular dress, but I am keeping this one as well.",81409,4
81409,It will be fine for other outfits.,81409,4
81409,"Not as sturdy or sleek as the other, but for some things, it will be fine.",81409,4
81409,I am glad to have both in my wardrobe.,81409,4
81409,"For reference, I have a 28-inch waist, and both belts fit fine.",81409,4
81410,It does run small - I ordered the biggest size.,81410,4
81411,I purchased this top as an accompaniment to the Women's Elastic Waist Below Knee Midi Flare Pleated Skirt for a performance I was in.,81411,4
81411,The top fit great according to my vision and the size I ordered.,81411,4
81411,I've gotten quite a few wears out of it and I have no regrets with this purchase.,81411,4
81411,"It's pretty and can be worn for work, date night, and a night out with the girls as well as a casual look.",81411,4
81412,We bought this to augment costumes for a family Halloween event.,81412,4
81412,"If you're looking for Ralph Lauren level quality, this is not for you.",81412,4
81412,"This is a very serviceable hoodie that looks just like its photos, fits fine, and is finely crafted with the world's most synthetic materials.",81412,4
81412,"Hey, its a wolf hoodie.",81412,4
81412,Would buy again and gladly recommend to anyone with realistic expectations.,81412,4
81414,Fabric is nicer than expected,81414,4
81416,"Beautiful, only it is a bit too big and heavy for me until my cartilage piercing is completely healed.",81416,4
81416,My ears are sensitive and take a long time to heal,81416,4
81417,I ordered a size up as advised by other reviewers.,81417,4
81417,A good thing cause a large would definitely not have been able to go on.,81417,4
81417,I'm 160lbs  and 36D.,81417,4
81417,The xl fits though exact across the chest.,81417,4
81417,This is polyester so no stretch at all.,81417,4
81417,All in all a fairly good purchase,81417,4
81418,Love it alot but wish it had few more pockets to keep small items,81418,4
81419,I love the glasses.,81419,4
81419,However they are not straight.,81419,4
81419,But for the price i decided to keep it and just try to straighten it out myself,81419,4
81420,"Being an old hippie, I love giving this gift to young hippy parents!",81420,4
81420,"It always goes over great, and I'm told it gets a lot of smiles and attention.",81420,4
81420,(Along with the babies of course!),81420,4
81421,Too cute for little ones!,81421,4
81422,"OK hat, nothing to brag about.",81422,4
81423,I'm a 38-40 waist.,81423,4
81423,I ordered an XL and a L (for later).,81423,4
81423,"I tried on both and found that I could actually enter the L, but with too much effort and too tight.",81423,4
81423,"The XL is my fit so I'm going with that until I can fit in the L. However, the one downside is the smell.",81423,4
81423,"It's so bad I give it a ""Crikey"" on the Steve Irwin scale.",81423,4
81423,Even before I removed it the smell was like an overwhelmingly dirty diaper.,81423,4
81423,Granted I've only been using it for 2 days.,81423,4
81423,I'll give a bit more time to see if that horrid stench fades.,81423,4
81424,Great looking hat but too small,81424,4
81425,The only drawback to this bag is that the zippers are a little stiff.,81425,4
81425,"Otherwise, it is fabulous!",81425,4
81425,There is a pocket for everything!,81425,4
81425,"The bag itself is lightweight, and seems to be waterproof (after surviving a downpour).",81425,4
81425,It can hold all my stuff plus my Kindle and Netbook.,81425,4
81426,"Great buy, loose and not hot",81426,4
81427,"While this hat is cute, the colours did not match those in the picture.",81427,4
81427,"The goggles are blue instead of silver/grey and the minion was more of a dark, mustard yellow than a bright yellow.",81427,4
81428,Great quality and larger than expected but will work great for my costume.,81428,4
81429,Thought the back would be a bit longer to hide the butt.,81429,4
81429,I'm 5'4 and 145 lbs,81429,4
81430,"Now, just have to test if the color won't bleed.",81430,4
81431,I like the conservative cut at the crouch but the top can be a bit low.,81431,4
81431,It dry easily and the color and lines feature have some slimming effect.,81431,4
81431,"But I have to put it on cautiously, doing one strap at a time as the opening between strap is a bit small.",81431,4
81431,Overall I am satisfied.,81431,4
81432,This item is almost what it appear to be the size do run very small but it live up to it statement and i like it.,81432,4
81433,A little wide for my medium/narrow feet but they are good enough to walk in and they look great!,81433,4
81434,"Love it, every comfortable.",81434,4
81435,"Very pretty, need now to find some way to wear it.",81435,4
81436,"It seems a little short , or maybe I have a fat wrist....",81436,4
81436,Seems like decent value,81436,4
81437,"Beautiful two piece dress, but not quite as illustrated in the photo.",81437,4
81437,"The tutu portion is very thin and transparent, so you see the bottom bortion of the dress.",81437,4
81437,"The seller is very accessible, kind, and responsive though.",81437,4
81438,I am 5'7'' 160lb Xlarge works thanks,81438,4
81439,"I like the C-panty for c-section recovery, it feels good!.",81439,4
81439,"Although, the back side goes up a little too high on me.",81439,4
81440,"Love the print, but it runs very small through the hip and large though the bust.",81440,4
81440,I sent it back for this reason as I will never get a good fit.,81440,4
81441,These are really great!,81441,4
81441,I left one star off because the sleeves don't roll up easily- I had to cut slits to let them roll up.,81441,4
81441,I love the knee pads and roominess of the coveralls.,81441,4
81441,I use them for painting.,81441,4
81442,I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift and he loved it.,81442,4
81442,The only complaint would be the storage amount.,81442,4
81442,One standard size card is meant for a single slot.,81442,4
81442,"You can fit 2 in one slot with no shutting problems, but try doubling on anymore and it won't shut.",81442,4
81442,It works perfect for minimalist so if you're trying to shed some weight be up on it.,81442,4
81442,"Oh and if you fill the wallet with cards, you won't have any space for cash.",81442,4
81442,You would need to carry a money clip or keep it loose in your pocket.,81442,4
81442,But who carries cash anymore?,81442,4
81444,Round dots on the inside are not smooth to the surface so I'm afraid of them coming off.,81444,4
81445,I needed an inexpensive gift and this bracelet fit the bill so well that I wanted to keep it for myself.,81445,4
81445,The bracelet is not for large wrists but women with large wrists usually remedy this by having bracelet/necklace extenders on hand.,81445,4
81445,"In fact, Amazon has a wide selection of extenders.",81445,4
81445,I would point out one down-side: the links aren't gong to withstand a lot of twisting.,81445,4
81445,"The link design is obviously a necessity in order to achieve the lovely ""leaf"" effect.",81445,4
81445,I did not receive any free items or discounts for this review.,81445,4
81445,It is my unbiased opinion of the product.,81445,4
81446,"With essentially any dress I order off of Amazon, I tend to size up.",81446,4
81446,"Cameras are never the most forgiving thing, so I like having the extra wiggle room.",81446,4
81446,"I think sizing up did help to hide my tummy more, still not entirely, but well enough that I'm comfortable wearing this dress on-air.",81446,4
81446,"However, the top is now a little too big, so I'd say this dress fits very true to size that I probably could've done without sizing up.",81446,4
81446,"Overall, this dress is still very flattering, and a nice additional to my work wardrobe.",81446,4
81446,"It's super comfortable, and I feel confident wearing it, so I call it another great find on Amazon for it's price.",81446,4
81446,"The material isn't thin, but not so thick that feels heavy sitting on your body.",81446,4
81446,I would definitely recommend purchasing this!,81446,4
81448,Nice fit and very flattering.,81448,4
81450,bought as a gift,81450,4
81451,Perfect color great quality.,81451,4
81451,One word of advice ....if you have a sensitive hearing ...the tic toc on this watch is as loud as it can be,81451,4
81452,"These are really cute, but a bit smaller than expected.",81452,4
81453,First of all I love the way this product looks.,81453,4
81453,The material is super soft and the color was spot on (I got the purple).,81453,4
81453,"It is a cropped jacket so the length fit as expected, but the sleeves were a little long coming down just past my wrists.",81453,4
81453,Luckily the zippers on the sleeves are functional and help in this case.,81453,4
81453,It is a little tight across the  front but overall a super cute find for the cost.,81453,4
81453,I give it four out of five stars.,81453,4
81454,Straps are a little large but that is okay.,81454,4
81454,I would rather be a little loose and clasp it in the back than too small.,81454,4
81455,"It is a beautiful ""dress"".",81455,4
81455,"Exactly as described, the color as well.",81455,4
81455,4 stars because I waited almost 2 months before I received it and it's about a size too small.,81455,4
81455,The top part fits great but the bottom part barely coveres up.,81455,4
81455,I usually wear a M/L dress size and ordered a L (biggest size available) for this dress,81455,4
81456,"Fit as expected, good quality, fast shipping, no complaints",81456,4
81457,"Super cute, and soft material.",81457,4
81457,"Fit is too short for my body, and I have a short body.",81457,4
81457,I would suggest getting a size larger than normal.,81457,4
81457,"Great color intensity, looks just like the photo provided.",81457,4
81458,I sewed up the two top holes so it fit better.,81458,4
81459,It's fit was too small and tight across the chest more like a junior fit.,81459,4
81459,The fabric and design was perfect.,81459,4
81459,"Overall, I give it for stars for running small even through I bought an XL.",81459,4
81460,"wonderful pair of glasses

thank you",81460,4
81461,"This is a really cute, well made swimsuit.",81461,4
81461,"I am working on my body, but have a pear shape and I am very self conscious of my hip/butt area.",81461,4
81461,Love that the skirt is long enough to cover without looking like an older woman's swimsuit.,81461,4
81461,"My only issue is that since I am pear-shaped, I have to tie the back of the top really tight as my bosom do not fill the lined breast cups and the fact that they are lined and stiff do not help.",81461,4
81461,I think they need to consider including a smaller cup or removing the stiff lining.,81461,4
81462,They are a little short to be called knee length but they are securely above my calves and appear to be quite durable.,81462,4
81462,"There are semitransparent segments along the cuff and ankle, and the heel seam is reasonably on point.",81462,4
81462,"At this point I have not tested their insulative potential, nor for dryness, but I suspect a fully synthetic blend will be serviceable to that effect.",81462,4
81463,I ordered this dress and I thought I would like it.,81463,4
81463,"Its well made, and fit great.",81463,4
81463,I just hated the way that it looked on me.,81463,4
81463,I did not return it though.,81463,4
81463,"One of my friends tried it on and she looked like a rockstar, so it now belongs to her.",81463,4
81463,So all in all it worked out.,81463,4
81463,It was definitely a gorgeous dress!,81463,4
81464,Loved this for my daughter.,81464,4
81464,But know it's not a sweater.,81464,4
81464,It's a long sleeved tee with a hood,81464,4
81465,"Very quick delivery, nice watch for my grandson.",81465,4
81465,I'm sure he'll like it.,81465,4
81466,"These were a gift, she loves them!",81466,4
81467,"Still larger than expected for a newborn gown, but better than some of the other products available.",81467,4
81467,Biggest problem is the disparity in price.,81467,4
81467,One is listed at $ 29.99 and another for $9.99.,81467,4
81467,I would purchase more if they were more reasonably priced.,81467,4
81468,This is a pretty decent coat.,81468,4
81468,"I'm about 5' 10"" and 160 lbs, size L is comfortable even if I wear a hoodie under it.",81468,4
81468,"I wish I had ordered black or grey instead of the navy blue, it's just a different shade of blue than what I expected.",81468,4
81469,"I ordered in hopes that they would fit my small face as some of the reviews said... Nope, they are for a small toddler sized child.",81469,4
81469,Seem to be good quality though!,81469,4
81470,It's a really cute shirt.,81470,4
81470,"The fit is as expected, but it had a funny/weird smell right out of the bag.",81470,4
81470,They shipped it without inner packaging.,81470,4
81470,The shirt was just folded into the mailing packaging.,81470,4
81470,"However, after washing the shirt, because you should wash clothing before first wear anyway, the smell was gone.",81470,4
81470,Over-all a nice/cute shirt.,81470,4
81471,It's beautiful  I was so worried by reviews that I was going to cancel my order.,81471,4
81472,bought for my daughter she loves it,81472,4
81473,Not my grandmothers home made quilt but good for the price.,81473,4
81473,I use them as furniture covers as I have dogs.,81473,4
81473,Minimal padding so easy to machine wash. Material is softer than on some others I have bought in the past.,81473,4
81474,The only thing about this suit that didn't work for me were the plastic cups.,81474,4
81474,My boobs were too full.,81474,4
81474,I ended up deconstructing it and taking them out.,81474,4
81474,I bought it to make into a high-waist 2-pic.,81474,4
81474,"For the price, even if I ruined it, I wouldn't even upset!",81474,4
81474,"The color was just a vibrant as advertised, which is why I bought it.",81474,4
81475,They have an extra piece is the back that gave my son a blister.,81475,4
81475,Hoping wearing then around the house will work,81475,4
81476,I've been looking for something like this for years!,81476,4
81476,"I wish it had a holder for a pen, but otherwise this is a great checkbook!",81476,4
81477,"Skirt is a little big, but very well made!",81477,4
81477,"Ordered a small, and a little big in waist.",81477,4
81477,Overall I like this 2 piece!,81477,4
81479,THIS IS ALL I WEAR.,81479,4
81479,IT SETS A TONE AND AVOIDS POLITICAL ARGUMENTS - and KEEPS THE COPS INFORMED THAT I'M A GOOD GUY.,81479,4
81480,I love the fit.,81480,4
81481,Crown  needs 4 vent holes .,81481,4
81481,Head will be refresh not wet.,81481,4
81482,Color was just as expected.,81482,4
81482,With yellow I was worried about the color since I wanted it to be a bright yellow but not on the neon green side.,81482,4
81483,"Received it yesterday, I'm wearing it today.",81483,4
81483,Fits good just a bit snug.,81483,4
81483,Not a big deal.,81483,4
81483,Just don't put it in the dryer.,81483,4
81484,Chain a little flimsy.,81484,4
81485,Plenty of length without being too loose a fit.,81485,4
81485,I would have like to see a better representation of the color.,81485,4
81486,Great shoe for cheap.,81486,4
81486,"Is a little tight at first, but it DOES loosen up with wear.",81486,4
81486,Good quality for price.,81486,4
81487,4/5 because they are absolutely not breathable.,81487,4
81487,"Of course that's ok mostly in the winter, which is what we got them for.",81487,4
81487,Cute patterns - although the dinosaurs are much larger and blurred IRL.,81487,4
81487,Great for the price though.,81487,4
81489,Was a bit small because my bust I would recommend going a size up if you have a big chest because there is no give on this dress and it's also a tad short for my liking.,81489,4
81489,It is cute though I just wear tight shorts underneath it to be safe!,81489,4
81490,"nice hangers, but the chain itself is not so wow",81490,4
81491,did not contact the seller.,81491,4
81492,This is a nice necklace.,81492,4
81492,I love the bright colors and it hangs nicely when worn.,81492,4
81493,It is a bit tight on the bottom and the material doesnt give at all.,81493,4
81494,This is very pretty and quite long!,81494,4
81494,"It is a gorgeous grey, just like the picture!",81494,4
81494,"However, it came in the package with the ends already fraying.",81494,4
81494,I'll have to figure out something to fix that before it gets worse.,81494,4
81494,I haven't had a chance to wear this yet.,81494,4
81494,"Fixing the ends shouldn't really be a problem, and this was a FANTASTIC price!",81494,4
81495,The product was crammed into a TINY reasealable baggie and when I took them out they were tangled but once I was able to unknot them they fit really nicely and look very sexy on!,81495,4
81496,Bought for my daughter who is a size 10 in kids and very picky about belts.,81496,4
81496,Fits well and she loves them.,81496,4
81496,The material is good quality however the assembly fell short.,81496,4
81496,The red bow was coming undone ever so slightly and some of the bows weren't centered properly.,81496,4
81496,You can hardly tell though.,81496,4
81496,"Even though I received them in plastic wrapping, my white bow arrived dirty.",81496,4
81497,It was the perfect size,81497,4
81498,"My fiance and I used these in Croatia for some cliff diving, and then again to walk around in Venice when the city floods at night.",81498,4
81498,"They are easy to get on, stay in place, and seem to be made fairly well.",81498,4
81498,"I was hoping for a little more sole protection when I ordered them, but it was difficult finding a happy medium of lightweight and sturdy sole.",81498,4
81499,A little small for size ordered.,81499,4
81500,My friends daughter was very happy when she saw picture and happier now that finally got there- took a long time,81500,4
81501,I normally wear a large 5'11 165 lbs.,81501,4
81501,and ordered a XL for a roomy fit but it fits like a large would normally.,81501,4
81502,"My head's a size medium, so maybe it's just me, but it's a little tight.",81502,4
81502,"Otherwise, I like how it fits and I like how it looks.",81502,4
81502,The felt is nice and soft.,81502,4
81502,"Don't rough house with this hat, though.",81502,4
81502,The material makes it so it's not the sturdiest.,81502,4
81502,"But this isn't a hard hat for construction, so that's not a complaint.",81502,4
81502,"As long as it doesn't dent on it's own, I'm fine.",81502,4
81502,"And no, it doesn't.",81502,4
81502,"But if I poke it, it can dent.",81502,4
81502,"I did this on accident grabbing it, but was able to correct said dents.",81502,4
81502,"Again, don't rough house with it.",81502,4
81502,There's not much else to say.,81502,4
81502,It's a good value and the hat is cute.,81502,4
81502,Perfect for a cosplay of Serena from Pokemon X and Y.,81502,4
81503,This is a unique print.,81503,4
81503,"I thought, though, that the fabric had a ""matte silk"" look.",81503,4
81503,"It is more of a ""polyester chiffon"" look.",81503,4
81503,It is still pretty.,81503,4
81503,"Throw it around your neck over a a ""little black dress"" and you have a WOW look !",81503,4
81505,It's very cute but it's a little short in length.,81505,4
81506,Great price nice product good quality,81506,4
81507,"This lasted me the whole summer (June-August), but then the sticky material started to peel off.",81507,4
81507,It did a great job of giving me support and push-up while it was new!,81507,4
81507,"But as it starts to wear out, the stickiness does go away and won't give you as good of a push-up.",81507,4
81507,"It also starts to slowly peel off, but all this is expected for a sticky bra especially in the summer.",81507,4
81509,"Given the price you pay for this product, I say you've found quite a deal.",81509,4
81509,Yes the belt feels flimsy and the H letter gold buckle is thinner than the original but overall it's a good belt.,81509,4
81509,It took quite a while to get here which makes sense given where it's shipped from.,81509,4
81509,You may have to get a belt hole puncher just in case though.,81509,4
81509,But I like it and it met my stylish needs.,81509,4
81510,"Great material not too thin,  I ordered a small and the skirt is still a little loose and I'm not that thin!",81510,4
81510,Overall I really like the outfit!,81510,4
81512,"Size runs slightly small, especially in the shoulders so order one size up.",81512,4
81513,Nice material but small.,81513,4
81514,Wear large but got x-large and it fits very nicely.,81514,4
81515,great shoes really cute but you do have to buy cushion insoles the ones in there aren't great,81515,4
81516,But i got 3t and it fit my son just right.,81516,4
81516,It was good for last minute christmas outfit,81516,4
81517,It is a nice little knit skirt.,81517,4
81517,It will be great for my holiday work party.,81517,4
81518,I get compliments on this dress all the time.,81518,4
81518,It is classy enough to wear to work with a blazer or for a night out.,81518,4
81518,"It's a beautiful dress, and looks like a very high quality item for a lot less money.",81518,4
81518,Four stars because the belt is a bit cheaply made-- I can see it breaking down the line and me needing to find a replacement.,81518,4
81518,The hole for the little nub to go through is already getting larger and wearing out.,81518,4
81520,"I've given this outfit a 4 star as once I'd got the right size for me the outfit was lovely, really well made.",81520,4
81520,But I really should of listened to the reviews about sizing!!!,81520,4
81520,I am a US size 6/8 so I ordered a 38 and a 40 thinking I could return the one not correct (free returns with prime!,81520,4
81520,"), The 38 would no where near zip up, the 40 just about would but I couldn't breath, so I had to order a 42!",81520,4
81520,"This fits fine, and it really is lovely (I have a Octoberfest fancy dress party to go to) and I'm looking forward to wearing it.",81520,4
81520,My advice is go at least 2 sizes up from your usual dress size!!!,81520,4
81521,I would give it 5 starts but I have had the small pin holding the clasp together come out.,81521,4
81521,I simple put it back in but I have to be aware it may come out on occasion.,81521,4
81521,It has only done that on one clasp.,81521,4
81521,"Other than that, they work great.",81521,4
81524,"I like it a lot, but the sizes are too small, I bought the XXL for my boyfriend (1.85 mts tall/ 6' feet) and it's too small for him.",81524,4
81524,But the hoodie is super cool!,81524,4
81524,too bad it did not fit him :(,81524,4
81525,"Ok, so I bought this nightgown after reading all the reviews.",81525,4
81525,I also bought the matching robe.,81525,4
81525,I purchased the bump in the night robe from motherhood maternity as well so I will post a comparison after I receive it.,81525,4
81525,"Most/all of the reviews I read talked about wearing after baby is born, or in the hospital after delivery.",81525,4
81525,"I am 31 weeks pregnant and was hoping to wear this for the rest of my pregnancy, but it is a little snug already, around my bump and rear.",81525,4
81525,Plenty of room in the chest.,81525,4
81525,I am worried as my bump grows it will become too tight.,81525,4
81525,"I am 5' 1"" and currently weigh 180lbs.",81525,4
81525,"I am a size 12 pre-pregnancy,  I am bottom heavy.",81525,4
81525,I am hoping it will stretch and then will fit better once I deliver.,81525,4
81527,The necklace could be longer but great buy!,81527,4
81528,"Fabric is a bit stiff, but may change after washing.",81528,4
81529,"I gave these away as gifts, seem to have went over pretty well.",81529,4
81530,BUT for the price it's great.,81530,4
81531,This actually fit a little loose.,81531,4
81531,"I'm a size 8 and an hourglass figure, and I ordered a medium, which is usually my size.",81531,4
81531,It doesn't fit in a streamlined way.,81531,4
81531,"I will put it in the dryer to shrink it a bit, but I'm surprised because I usually expect these kinds of products to be sized a bit small.",81531,4
81531,"Anyway, don't size up.",81531,4
81531,You may actually need to go down a size.,81531,4
81532,This shirt fulfilled my requirements.,81532,4
81532,Like one of the other raters I bought it to match my daughters halloween costume.,81532,4
81532,I bought a medium and usually wear a small.,81532,4
81532,If I had to buy it again I'd go with a small.,81532,4
81533,"I thought this was several loose bands, but it is one piece.",81533,4
81533,"I had to replace the chain- it broke right away, but it was only a little piece.",81533,4
81533,I have had many comments about how cute this looks.,81533,4
81533,So I bought some more in other colors!,81533,4
81534,Will look beautiful with my daughter's prom dress.,81534,4
81534,She is very happy the piece.,81534,4
81535,I purchased this Om Dog tag for my boyfriend and he loves it.,81535,4
81535,"It is well constructed and hit nicely on his chest, not too high and not too long.",81535,4
81535,"My only disappointment was the OM symbol which was supposed to be black but ended up being a type of brown, now I don't know if that's how they all come or if I misordered, but all in all I am still satisfied and it is lovely.",81535,4
81537,"This is so cute and wonderful the necklace was a little cheap, but the pendant is adorable my daughter lives it",81537,4
81538,"Nice product, but way too small.",81538,4
81540,I purchased in all three colors.,81540,4
81540,My only issue was mine had a strange smell when I opened them.,81540,4
81540,I wash all three on delicate with Woolite.,81540,4
81540,Have to reference the pics to figure out how to wear it.,81540,4
81541,4/5 stars because they are see through.,81541,4
81541,They fit well though.,81541,4

81543,got a lot of compliments on this one!,81543,4
81544,Cute necklace but very flimsy.,81544,4
81545,"Great, was just what I was expecting!!",81545,4
81546,Pretty.. Well made.. Just not what I wanted in style,81546,4

81548,I wish it was a bit longer but perfect for trips to the grocery store or babysitter.,81548,4
81550,Thought there were pockets in all three that I purchased.,81550,4
81550,This brand usually has them and they're important to me.,81550,4
81550,"Otherwise, quite wearable, especially at the price.",81550,4
81551,"Quality is very Good, but its quite short even that Im average height",81551,4
81552,"With some simple adjustments at a local store, it will be perfect.",81552,4
81552,"I ordered a 6 and my daughter is a 7, it was a little large up top.",81552,4
81553,I liked these a lot the only thing I really have to complain about is the fact I am scared they will go straight through my ear because if the flare size but oh well lol.,81553,4
81554,"Ships from China, Made for a smaller women.",81554,4
81555,"Nice jacket, good price, looks great.",81555,4
81555,My only complaint is the inside of the fabric has a weird sticky sort of feel so I don't think I will ever wear it without the lease liner.,81555,4
81556,Okay...would like a tighter fit.,81556,4
81557,Very nice my daughter loves it,81557,4
81558,I like the size of the product  and color.,81558,4
81559,Great panties that are made well!,81559,4
81560,"After going through the wash 2-3 times, the characters start to break down, but a good product for the price.",81560,4
81561,this is nice but i gave it to my daughter,81561,4
81562,"I'm 5'7"" and ordered a small and it was a bit too short though",81562,4
81563,I work at Starbucks and I bought this dress to wear to work.,81563,4
81563,The material is very nice and lightweight and the length of it is only a few inches above the knee which is perfect.,81563,4
81563,I have a bigger bust so I'll have to add another button but that's fine.,81563,4
81563,It's very comfortable and has just enough give to work in.,81563,4
81563,"I am 195lbs, 5'5'' and the XL fit me just right.",81563,4
81563,The only reason this did not get 5 Stars was because I did not receive the belt and my order took almost two months to arrive.,81563,4
81563,"Other than that, I am very satisfied.",81563,4
81563,I might even buy another.,81563,4

81566,looks just like the picture and I agree with other reviews- wearing it with shorts and boots would be the way to go!,81566,4

81567,But great boot still.,81567,4

81572,It fit good but one thing that did kind of bother me was the neck line.,81572,4
81572,It was kind of a weird shape and laid on my chest slightly off.,81572,4
81572,Otherwise it was a cute shirt and I would order it again.,81572,4
81573,Very helpful on my last trip.,81573,4
81575,Love love love the color and materials it's made of.,81575,4

81645,It would be perfect if it were a tad shorter for Petites.,81645,4
81645,The price was a bargain fro such a nice article of clothing.,81645,4
81645,I got many compliments when I wore this to my business casual workday.,81645,4
81646,this is my second time buying this belt....I lost some weight and needed a smaller one...sturdy belt,81646,4
81647,"A bit big to be called a ""compression fit"" may want to order a size smaller if you want the ""stretch fit"".",81647,4
81647,Otherwise is a great work out shirt.,81647,4
81648,These are working decent in my boots...,81648,4
81648,I'm a corrections officer in a county jail and I stay on my feet for hours on end.,81648,4
81648,My arch has been killing me and I was hoping these would be higher and firmer... and stay firm.,81648,4
81648,They feel like they have collapsed a little after a few months of use.,81648,4
81648,"I can still feel them supporting my arch, but not putting nice pressure on it like I hoped.",81648,4
81648,These are still excellent quality and have helped a ton however.,81648,4
81648,I will buy this brand again...,81648,4
81648,"I just may look for the high arch variety, or maybe even something plastic.",81648,4
81650,And will be warm.,81650,4
81650,I bought it for cold days on my scooter.,81650,4
81650,"However, at 3am and a few shots of whiskey(and when I say a few I mean 10 or so) I guess I forgot it is summer and I live in Fla.",81650,4
81650,I'll get back to you in Jan. or Feb.,81650,4
81650,it is what I expected.,81650,4
81650,The price was good.,81650,4
81650,I might buy another.,81650,4
81650,But when I do it won't be 95 degrees outside.,81650,4
81652,Fit better than I expected.,81652,4
81652,Very good buy for the price!,81652,4
81653,I love everything about this suit but the sizing.,81653,4
81653,The bottom is short shorts which makes it great for walking.,81653,4
81653,I needed more coverage on top.,81653,4
81654,A little big up under my arm,81654,4
81655,Cute for 12 yr old girl who loves cats.,81655,4
81656,My daughter loves tights but theres not always a gurantee they will fit.,81656,4
81656,She is a size 11 in pants(US) and 5ft 3in.,81656,4
81656,"They fit her snugly, but she loved them!",81656,4
81656,Will have to buy another pair for her soon since the previous ones got lost.,81656,4
81657,The shoes are very comfortable ....I Like them,81657,4
81658,A little smaller than I thought....But still ok,81658,4
81659,"Beautiful dress, but I had to return it because it was way too long on my daughter.",81659,4
81660,"if you tie the strings on the top, you can make it smaller.",81660,4
81660,the bottom was jus not form fitting at all and a larger.,81660,4
81660,maybe consider making an XS version of this product?,81660,4
81661,Arrived a week before it said it would.,81661,4
81662,Not as vibrant color as the picture.,81662,4
81662,"The braiding is not as deep/rich in color, but still a very pretty ring.",81662,4
81663,"Fits small, so order a size up so you won't have to loosen the shirt too much.",81663,4
81664,"I like this, its very comfortable and flowy.",81664,4
81664,"The quality isn't the greatest, but for now it is good and I'm pleased.",81664,4
81664,I worry that the string around the waist won't last that long though.,81664,4
81664,Its already showing some wear and I've only had it almost two months and worn it about four or five times.,81664,4
81665,"Loved the fabric and color for the price, it was just too small for me.",81665,4
81667,Runs so small you need 2x your regular size....however it is very cute,81667,4
81668,But because of the width I had to return it and order a size up.,81668,4
81668,I received the corrected size ring today.,81668,4
81670,"Decent shoes, unfortunately, at my daughter's age, there aren't many bowling shoes that will even fit her.",81670,4
81670,"She wasn't crazy about these, but they fit and function as expected, so I can't say anything negative about them.",81670,4
81671,It was an okay shirt.,81671,4
81671,Not too thin and not too thick.,81671,4
81671,But the collar looked like stretched out or something.,81671,4
81671,Like a vey old shirt that has been used a lot.,81671,4
81672,Good quality for a price.,81672,4
81672,"But...maybe just in my case, when use it for a long time, I feel little burden to trapezius.",81672,4
81673,Very nice Capri leggings.,81673,4
81673,"Especially if you're a tall girl like me (5'7.5"") they are actual Capri leggings that go about mid calf.",81673,4
81673,"But I ordered a M/L and I have a very small waist but big hips& quads & glutes so it fits everything but my 28"" waist.",81673,4
81674,I really liked this dress but it runs smalland I'm very curvy.,81674,4
81674,The elasticity of the fabric wasn't as stretchy as I thought it would be.,81674,4
81677,"V. Cute, but runs v. Large!",81677,4
81677,"Which is fine if you like that comfy, loose, wearing a man's T look.",81677,4
81678,The coat is very cute but not really for keeping warm.,81678,4
81678,"It really is more of a fashion piece to complete your look, IMO.",81678,4
81678,The fit is a tad boxy.,81678,4
81678,"I am 5'7"" and size 2 - 4.",81678,4
81678,I got like this in a Large based on other comments.,81678,4
81678,"I am glad I did and when wearing garments under the coat, it is a near perfect fit.",81678,4
81678,"It is very soft and I have been wanting a pink coat, so I am very happy with it.",81678,4
81679,I bought a large and my waist is 32'' and it fit well.,81679,4
81679,However my height is 5 ft 2 ins and I find it's too long.,81679,4
81679,I have to take up the hem.,81679,4
81680,The colors are a bit deceiving.,81680,4
81680,The dark color is more of a brownish red color.,81680,4
81680,The chain is black.,81680,4
81680,I thought the pics made it look like it is black and red.,81680,4
81680,It's pretty much something you could find at the Family Dollar store.,81680,4
81680,Good cheaper costume jewelry though.,81680,4
81680,"Ya get what u pay for, I guess!",81680,4
81682,"The top fits just a little big, but definitely not enough to be any issue.",81682,4
81682,"The bottoms however are super cheeky, especially if your butt is bigger than average.",81682,4
81682,"If you don't like cheeky, make sure you have other bottoms.",81682,4
81683,Its cute but the top wrap is tricky.,81683,4
81684,If the cover was glass it would be perfect.,81684,4
81684,Works well but the plastic cover makes it look cheap,81684,4
81685,Not super warm if you live in very cold climates.,81685,4
81685,Best for short jaunts out to play in the snow.,81685,4
81685,Best plus to me is that they are super lightweight!,81685,4
81686,"Nice dress, but too small for me.",81686,4
81686,"I made a mistake and ordered the medium, when I should have gotten a large.",81686,4
81686,It was a struggle to put on.,81686,4
81686,"It looks really nice, and you can't tell how tight it is.",81686,4
81686,I will be reordering it and getting my correct size.,81686,4
81686,I finally got it on and decided I better take pictures before I take it off.,81686,4
81686,"I'm a size 10, so the large should be perfect for me.",81686,4
81687,Purchased pea coat for my boyfriend.,81687,4
81687,"He loved the style, being a husky man, some coats make him look too bulky.",81687,4
81687,"This coat has a slimming effect while being roomy, he can wear thick sweaters comfortably underneath it.",81687,4
81687,"The pockets on the side are nice and deep, the coat keeps him warm these crispy fall days.",81687,4
81687,I don't think it will be warm enough for windy winter days.,81687,4
81688,A great value for a leather purse!,81688,4
81689,"Love the pants,the shirt is smaller than expected!",81689,4
81690,Good a little expensive.,81690,4
81691,everyone who see this outfit likes it.,81691,4
81692,I gave it away because I bought the wrong size.,81692,4
81693,It was a but bigger but I actually like the looseness of the shirt as I think it makes it casual chic and cute,81693,4
81695,"Love it, I'm 5'9/130lbs/34B and I bought a medium.",81695,4
81695,"The only thing is, the top wrinkles easily-- but that's nothing a little steaming or ironing can't fix.",81695,4
81695,I wore with a nude strapless bra and it was not see-through.,81695,4
81695,It feels like it's 100% cotton and so I do not dry after washing because I believe it would shrink right up!,81695,4
81695,"I'd like to think I can dress this up for fall/winter, in addition to how I wore it in the summer (photo)",81695,4
81696,I like the fit and the color - just what I wanted simple and must travel well because it didn't need pressing out of the package.,81696,4
81697,"Really cute, fits well, awesome casual cosplay item.",81697,4
81697,The ears were shorter than I expected though.,81697,4
81698,The only issue I have is the colors as it looks to much like Michigan!,81698,4
81698,"Overall it is a good Pajama, easy to get on my son and does not fit too loose.",81698,4
81699,Looks great and provides great cushioning for my laptop.,81699,4
81699,"The down side is I use a wireless mouse on my laptop(15.6""), and the dongle gets the laptop stuck when trying to take it out.",81699,4
81699,"It is very small and goes in with no issues, but gets hooked on the inside when trying to take it out.",81699,4
81699,I tried placing it in different ways and it rendered the same results.,81699,4
81699,"Still a great bag, just a minor issue.",81699,4
81700,"It was a great deal, since it was last year's ...",81700,4
81701,Cute simple and cheap.,81701,4
81701,Perfect for a quick beach vacay :),81701,4
81703,There was a slight smell to this when it first came in and worn.,81703,4
81703,"But, after letting it air a bit, it was great to use overall.",81703,4
81703,"It's slightly tricky getting the positioning right so that it doesn't jog up my glasses, however.",81703,4
81703,"But if you were to wear a pair of goggles or wear contacts, it shouldn't be a problem.",81703,4
81703,"Be warned, I wore it in Yosemite when it was about 30-40F and it felt pretty toasty in this after a few minutes of playing in the snow.",81703,4
81704,"Fit well and daughter loves it, Nice product.",81704,4
81707,"Purchased this for a cruise, perfect for days off the ship.",81707,4
81709,I had to send this back due to canceled marriage but it was a nice ring,81709,4
81710,It arrived right on time!,81710,4
81710,"I got it and the ""diamond"" was larger than I expected which is great I guess.",81710,4
81710,I got this ring to wear out and about it to wear if we travel.,81710,4
81710,I got a size 6 and I usually wear a size 6 but this ring is loose.. and maybe that's because the stone is large and heavy?,81710,4
81710,But it is loose on my finger so I wish they would've had a size 5 but they don't.,81710,4
81710,I also wish that this ring had bands that go with it because I love matching bands.,81710,4
81710,So I got separate bands in hopes that it would fit under the stone and they don't!,81710,4
81710,I don't think any extra separate band would fit under the stone so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.,81710,4
81711,"The product is good, but it runs very small.",81711,4
81711,"I'm 5'3 and 150lbs, and I purchased the 2XL/3XL because of the waist measurements.",81711,4
81712,This is nice quality.,81712,4
81712,"The only reason I took off a star, is because the bust area seems large.",81712,4
81712,And I don't have a small bust at all... 32 DD...,81712,4
81712,So I have to pin it together in the front so I don't spill out of the loose fabric.,81712,4
81713,"Such a cute mermaid bikini top
But if you have big boobs, maybe one size up & will be fine!",81713,4
81714,"Fit well, I got the biggest sized offered and I usually wear 18/20 size pants and it fit ok.  Good thing I'm not taller than 5'2"" because it's kinda tight up and down ways, but helps me look thinner...",81714,4
81715,The bi-focal line falls at the proper spot,81715,4
81716,"Nice, light, comfortable top.",81716,4
81716,"I have washed it a couple times and the fold lines don't come out, but that may just be the material.",81716,4
81716,"Especially for the price, I don't regret buying it.",81716,4
81717,"Pretty, comfortable, nice cut.",81717,4
81717,After washing no shrinkage but facing wrinkled.,81717,4
81719,Although the material is subject to wrinkles!,81719,4
81720,Good fitting as expected,81720,4
81721,"I love this bag, which it came in an other color as well, for summer.",81721,4
81722,The reviews said they fit small and it was suggested that customers buy one size up.,81722,4
81722,I bought one size up and it was somewhat big.,81722,4
81722,I should have followed my mind and bought L instead of XL,81722,4
81723,Packed all i needed !,81723,4
81724,I love Polo Ralph Lauren but these sweatpants are very expensive and it's 60% cotton and 40% polyester.,81724,4
81724,The quality is just not there with the material.,81724,4
81724,The quality is with the style and that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars.,81724,4
81724,I'm not sure how it's gonna wash so I'm kind of scared that it's going to get all ugly on me.,81724,4
81724,I am 5ft 9in.,81724,4
81724,I usually wear a 10 and the medium fits snug.,81724,4
81725,the color is a little different.,81725,4
81725,"however, it looks nice.",81725,4
81726,I love this purse!!!,81726,4
81726,It fits nearly everything and has a perfect sized pocket for my cell phone.,81726,4
81726,The only thing I didn't like was the small zipper on the side.,81726,4
81726,It gets stuck every time so I don't use the pocket.,81726,4
81728,"You pay the ""stainless steel"" price for this, they're not pretending it's titanium for 20 bucks like most dishonest sellers on here-of which I've bought and returned.",81728,4
81728,"It appears to be a deep black coating, little specks of blue show up inside occasionally.",81728,4
81728,"This is what stainless is worth and properly priced, like I said.",81728,4
81728,"You're not going to get real titanium for under 50 bucks, so don't even waste your time.",81728,4
81729,"Great shirt, and very cute.",81729,4
81730,"It was a good fit, but it was see through (i got white) but it only covered half my torso, but its a crop top.",81730,4
81730,What should i expect :),81730,4
81731,"This is such a cute little dress, but it is too small.",81731,4
81731,"I bought a large, and I'm about a size 8-10.",81731,4
81731,"Fortunately, I'm on a trim down program so I think it will looks great next summer.",81731,4
81732,"Love the dress, the bra inserts are strange though, seem to be placed high, unless it is just me.",81732,4
81732,Love the fit and very true to size I feel.,81732,4
81733,"Comfortable material, and they are slim fit, as expected.",81733,4
81734,"I love the dress but the M was too big for me, but no worries because a little needle a thread fixed it to be comfortable for appearance !",81734,4
81734,I'm 5'6 and weigh 135 lbs.,81734,4
81737,"I like the skirt fine, it's very comfortable and quite casual which is why I bought it.",81737,4
81738,Is very pretty and looks just like shown in the picture.,81738,4
81738,I have the iPhone 6plus and it will fit only if case is removed.,81738,4
81738,"Other than that, great product and happy with my buy.",81738,4
81739,It's really good to wear with a dress or something that you want to be slimmer and not have the lines.,81739,4
81740,Seems flimsy but man is it cute!!!!,81740,4
81740,Got it for my sister in law and wish I had gotten one for me too!,81740,4
81740,Lots of card slots too!,81740,4
81742,Lovely shirt alone or under a blazer.,81742,4
81742,Deep purple color is as shown.,81742,4
81743,I wish the packaging was better or there were directions on how to wash.,81743,4
81743,But they look amazing.,81743,4
81743,They smell bad by the way,81743,4
81744,Love it but u can see through,81744,4
81745,"Cute and lightweight, perfect for a busy toddler.",81745,4
81746,I ordered these shorts for a festival and when I got them they were slightly large.,81746,4
81746,They kept falling off my hips.,81746,4
81746,Im 5'7'' and 215lbs and I ordered a 1x just to make sure they were going to be okay as far as fit wise.,81746,4
81746,"The material however is very soft and stretchy, and the pockets are very handy.",81746,4
81746,"All in all, I couldn't wear them to the festival but they are perfect for lounge around the house shorts.",81746,4
81747,"Very warm and comfortable slippers, only downside is that the very back of the slipper sits too low on the foot, making the slipper, slip off as you walk.",81747,4
81747,"Poorly designed, but seriously warm and comfortable.",81747,4
81747,They're great if you're just lounging around and not walking anywhere!,81747,4
81748,"It is very good and fits exactly as expected ,but the quality of the fabric is not as in the picture",81748,4
81750,Fits as expected and worked perfectly for the event we attended.,81750,4
81751,The sweat gets inside and makes the screen fog.,81751,4
81751,"Then when you get rained on, the water gets in, and somehow screws with the time so you have to reset it all the time.",81751,4
81751,Then it stops working.,81751,4
81752,"It took a long time to get here; it ships from China, which made me skeptical.",81752,4
81752,"Almost anytime I order on Amazon and it is coming from China I have received the wrong product, a knock off product, or I don't receive my item at all.",81752,4
81752,"BUT, this product is great.",81752,4
81752,it is surprisingly good quality.,81752,4
81752,I love the cream and red (which is actually maroon) colors and they are very soft and light weight.,81752,4
81752,I ordered an XL; I am 5'4 and I wear a size 16 and have DDD breasts.,81752,4
81752,"It would zip just fine over my stomach but there was no zipping over my breasts, which I expected honestly.",81752,4
81753,Great shoes for the price.,81753,4
81753,"I ordered a 44 after reading reviews and viewing a sizing chart, they were still a little big but not enough to make me return them.",81753,4
81753,The clips wiggle a little but that is expected with these types of clips/pedals.,81753,4
81753,If you don't like the shoe to have a little movement on the pedal I recommend getting a different style of clip.,81753,4
81753,"All in all, happy with the purchase and functionality of the shoes/clips/pedals.",81753,4
81754,Very warm and kept my hands dry but one of them started splitting at seam after a couple of wears.,81754,4
81754,Not sure if because I washed them or not.,81754,4
81754,I still like them and it is an easy fix.,81754,4
81754,I would still buy them.,81754,4
81755,"Very nice, only looks expensive.",81755,4
81756,The tights where pretty well made and survived a couple parties this weekend (I have a bad track record of drunkenly snagging tights).,81756,4
81756,"The color was not quite as pictured, they a little brighter and more aqua... they are also not as sheer.",81756,4
81756,Down a star for the picture being off but keeping four for the quality.,81756,4
81757,fit well and is comfortable -- love pockets,81757,4
81758,It is bit longer in the length then what's shown on the picture but looks really stylish and fits well.,81758,4
81758,I get lot of compliments on it.,81758,4
81759,This is a cute shirt -fits good.,81759,4
81759,The only thing I'm deducting a star for is the color is  darker pink than what the picture shows,81759,4
81760,The only reason that I did not give this item 5 stars is because I have not washed it yet and I don't know how the material will hold up since it is fairly thin.,81760,4
81760,"That being said, it is light and flowy.",81760,4
81760,I ordered an XL which is my regular US size and I was pleasantly surprised by how flattering the fit was.,81760,4
81760,It is perfect for leggings is stylish enough for a casual work outfit.,81760,4
81761,Gets wet easy with sweat wile working tho.,81761,4
81761,But it's a great windblock for the face an bandana in the summer.,81761,4
81761,It's okay to wash it too just gets a little wrinkly.,81761,4
81762,"Great look, but a little heavy.",81762,4
81763,"Thin, light, true no show, best no shows I've tried so far.",81763,4
81764,"I really like this swimsuit, however, like others have mentioned, it is short in the torso.",81764,4
81764,"I'm 5'8"" and it could use about 2 more inches in the torso length.",81764,4
81764,However it's not so bad that I won't wear it!,81764,4
81765,My son's girlfriend loved the softness and construction of them,81765,4
81766,Kinda tight should be ok,81766,4
81767,i have bought these socks before from another vendor so went with same size.,81767,4
81767,the sizing tends to vary even with the size recommendations.,81767,4
81768,I quite like these sunglasses.,81768,4
81768,"They have a nice heavier feel to them, and I love the shape.",81768,4
81768,I like the coloring of the lenses except that they make my phone screen look really strange.,81768,4
81768,"I dropped a star because even though I like the glasses, I think they're a bit overpriced.",81768,4
81768,I would expect them to be $10-12.,81768,4
81769,I made the mistake to follow up the recommendations in the reviews and ordered a size up.,81769,4
81769,It is not as fitted as I wanted.,81769,4
81769,I am 5'2 and weight 110lbs.,81769,4
81769,Ordered a size M,81769,4
81771,The gold squares on the shoulders look tacky.,81771,4
81771,I'm looking for a way to remove them.,81771,4
81772,They turn long way better once you put it on.,81772,4
81772,Also the price is really good.,81772,4
81774,the tie is a bit clumsy,81774,4
81775,Fit really well and great quality,81775,4
81776,I had a piercing that wouldn't open full and need just a little helping hand opening back up.,81776,4
81776,It's was great for what I needed.,81776,4
81776,I didn't use any of the jewelry it came with.,81776,4
81776,Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the claps they felt cheap but did the job.,81776,4
81777,"Only order one size up, people said to order 2 sizes up and that's was way too much for me.",81777,4
81777,I returned only because of the size and got a size smaller.,81777,4
81778,I was very disappointed that it didn't fit.,81778,4
81778,I'm a true 14/16.,81778,4
81778,"The top fits me, but it's very short.",81778,4
81778,I was expecting it to be loose fitting like it was described.,81778,4
81779,Nice piece but a lot smaller than I expected.,81779,4
81780,Very long like all reviews say,81780,4
81782,It's looks nice but somehow large,81782,4
81783,Good old gag gift,81783,4
81784,The bottoms show more cheek than expected but I do like the fit of both the top and bottoms!,81784,4
81784,The print is vibrant and as pictured!,81784,4
81786,It was a decent price and cute dress.,81786,4
81786,Only thing was that one of the strings to hold the rope in the back unsewed and a couple of jems became loose at the sequence.,81786,4
81786,"No biggie thou, you couldn't tell.",81786,4
81787,I read quite a few reviews before purchasing.,81787,4
81787,A lot of women expressed that they bought a size up so I did too and it fit exactly as my normal size would.,81787,4
81787,I would suggest purchasing one size up.,81787,4
81787,I really like the dress I only wish it wasn't so transparent.,81787,4
81787,It will be good only as a cover-up over my bathing suit.,81787,4
81787,"Certainly not to be worn ""around town"" without a slip.",81787,4
81788,The last watch band I received I gave a 5-star review only to have it start coming apart the next day.,81788,4
81788,"I've used this one a week,and in the meantime I've been traveling, camping and hiking, and it's in good shape after that.",81788,4
81788,"I think it's an attractive band, with a nice pattern to the grain.",81788,4
81788,"It says water resistant, and yes, I was in the rain and splashed by turbulent Great Lake water.",81788,4
81788,"The description says ""spring bars included"", though they are not pictured.",81788,4
81788,"They were not, in fact, included: I had to use my original spring bars.",81788,4
81788,It's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.,81788,4
81788,"I didn't mind, but what's delivered should match the description.",81788,4
81789,"Too small, fabric nice, good quality",81789,4
81791,The product has good quality.,81791,4
81791,A little big with others Pandora Charms.,81791,4
81792,Let me just start by saying that they are very ugly but if you like them that is a personal preference.,81792,4
81792,I got them because they were the closest to flat lenses that I could find.,81792,4
81792,"I want to use them for driving and I find that less the lense is curved the less distortion and ""weird movement"" feeling I get.",81792,4
81792,"They are still a little curved, I wish they were perfectly flat but they do the job.",81792,4
81793,Got here on time.,81793,4
81793,Great shirt for the money,81793,4
81794,"comfy and has stood up to quite a few washings, though some of the threads are coming loose.",81794,4
81794,"totally opaque, but the fabric shows the outlines of my navel jewelry, and anything else I happen to be wearing under it.",81794,4
81795,I wish the top was big enough for me......the bottoms were adorable though.,81795,4
81795,If you wear a 40DD or above this is not the suit for you.,81795,4
81796,"The reviews posted so far look very generic, and don't provide much detail of any kind.",81796,4
81796,Makes me wonder if they even come from real owners.,81796,4
81796,"Anyway, I actually do own this bag.",81796,4
81796,"I've only used it for one weekend, so I can't comment on long term durability, but these are my observations so far...",81796,4
81796,This bag is just a little wider side-to-side and a little narrower front-to-back than an Adidas gym bag that I had been using as a weekend travel bag (overall cubic inches comes out about the same).,81796,4
81796,The big difference (other than appearance) is that the KAKA bag has more pockets than most bags this size.,81796,4
81796,"The item description and images here provide a good overview of the pockets, so I won't bother to repeat it.",81796,4
81796,I will simply say that this bag kept my things much more organized and accessible than they've been in the past.,81796,4
81796,Zippers on the bag are all metal.,81796,4
81796,"The front pocket looks like a buckle closure, but that's mostly for appearance, and it actually closes with magnets.",81796,4
81796,"The stitching throughout the bag looks good, if not necessarily heavy-duty.",81796,4
81796,"As for overall appearance, some people will like it; some will not.",81796,4
81796,My girlfriend says it's ugly.,81796,4
81796,I said it looks like something Theodore Roosevelt might have used (I have the khaki version).,81796,4
81796,"I will say that the bag is a little more ""frumpy"" than what the pictures here show.",81796,4
81796,"When empty, it pretty much slumps over.",81796,4
81796,"And even when packed, it doesn't quite maintain the boxy shape and straight edges you see in the images.",81796,4
81796,I'm including a picture (taken from a cheap phone... sorry) to give some sense of the size and it's general shape when packed.,81796,4
81798,"I just wish it had more cotton, but wears better than I expected.",81798,4
81799,This is the cutest elephant necklace.,81799,4
81799,I gave one as a gift then I had to order myself one because she is so pretty.,81799,4
81799,Very shiny and well made.,81799,4
81799,I received mine two weeks later and the chain had a knot and some of the shine is off my necklace.,81799,4
81799,That's why I took off a star.,81799,4
81800,They feel light and nice.,81800,4
81800,Great for those hot nights... in more ways than one.,81800,4
81800,Just remember to follow washing directions so they don't get damaged and you'll be fine!,81800,4
81801,I love my skirt when it arrived it was very small and only one leg fit but I got fur added and it came out great,81801,4
81802,Also very comfortable and colorful.,81802,4
81802,I love all the colors and the tassels.,81802,4
81802,Happy that I purchased.,81802,4
81803,Very good quality for the price .. definitely not a dress but is perfect with leggings or jeggings and heels,81803,4
81804,"I thought the skirt would stretch, since it's a one size, but it does not.",81804,4
81804,It actually doesn't fit me.,81804,4
81804,"It's beautiful but unfortunately, it only fits skinny girls.",81804,4
81805,Only nursing pregnancy bra that would fit comfortably at the end and great for nursing.,81805,4
81805,I land in the larger breasted women category.,81805,4
81806,"I would give it five stars, but the front shape of the body suit was not in the v neck form as pictured.",81806,4
81806,It was more rounded.,81806,4
81807,This is a great summer hat for our very bald baby.,81807,4
81807,It has a bungee that does not work very well to adjust.,81807,4
81807,"The string is a little cheap that connects to it, but since their are strings too we just tie it around the back.",81807,4
81807,I still feel like it was a good find regardless!,81807,4
81808,Sorta tight on arms i should have gotten one more size up and the fabric feels a little weird but its good,81808,4
81809,Worried about size being too small so I ordered a size up and it fit better than I expected.,81809,4
81809,The corset backing allowed me to tighten it.,81809,4
81810,Fits Very well .. ordered a Large .. forms for the body and I'm 5foot even and 175 solid .. 42D.. you will love this dress ...,81810,4
81812,Perfect for going out comes with a belt and it's a great deal can't pass it up perfect for a party,81812,4
81813,"I am 5'6 150 lbs and I ordered an X-Large, but I could have honestly gone with the large.",81813,4
81813,"I was afraid the shoulders wouldn't fit, but there is so much room in the XL.",81813,4
81813,"But great Jacket, goes with basically everything, but doesn't keep you that warm, unless you're wearing a sweater underneath",81813,4
81814,Wish it was easier to clean,81814,4
81815,I purchased this costume for Halloween 2016.,81815,4
81815,"I'm 5'1"", 120-125 lbs and a Small fit me perfectly.",81815,4
81815,"Pros:
-The material was comfortable, slinky, breathed really well for a body suit and looked very slimming.",81815,4
81815,"-Though the fabric was thin, no undergarments were visible.",81815,4
81815,"-I wore it for about eight hours straight and returned home with zero tears, holes or snags.",81815,4
81815,"-Even when the mask was off, the costume was instantly recognizable.",81815,4
81815,"-Everything foam (with the exception of the belt, which is tied on like a sash) was sewn on and perfectly in place as I zipped myself into the bodysuit.",81815,4
81815,-The cape is attached with Velcro onto the back of the bodysuit.,81815,4
81815,It was light enough to wear for hours at a time and stayed on the whole night.,81815,4
81815,"Cons:
-The shin guard foam piece were sewn on wrong and jutted.",81815,4
81815,I decided to return/reorder the costume.,81815,4
81815,They were perfectly placed the second time around.,81815,4
81815,-The chest piece and belt were painted VERY crudely.,81815,4
81815,I suggest repainting it if you have time or do a quick touch up with a silver Sharpie.,81815,4
81815,"-The mask was pretty bad (little visibility/suffocating), but then again most Halloween masks are.",81815,4
81815,It seemed oddly small compared to the size of the costume on my body so I ended up holding it most of the night.,81815,4
81815,"Overall, I have no regrets about purchasing this costume and would recommend it to others.",81815,4
81815,There were little hiccups here and there but they were easily fixed.,81815,4
81816,The top had little support and was too big which does not happen very often.,81816,4
81816,"Typically that is my trouble area,(I am a 38DDD)but  other than that it was a great purchase!!",81816,4
81817,Bought this as a gag gift for co-worker.,81817,4
81817,It's now hanging behind his desk.,81817,4
81818,runs a little small.very pretty ring,81818,4
81819,"If you are thinking about a large, purchase a medium.",81819,4
81819,The quality of the product is excellent.,81819,4
81820,"The cards fit in a little too tightly, but otherwise it's a perfect wallet!",81820,4
81821,Have bought before Better Quality than the V neck  Recommended,81821,4
81822,Shirt neck tight for a 15 to 15 1/2,81822,4
81823,Really cute and comfy.,81823,4
81823,I ordered a 2X.,81823,4
81823,"My waist is 42 inch, hips 48.",81823,4
81823,I'll keep them but will order a second pair that's smaller.,81823,4
81824,"The bracelet also broke within 5 minutes of wearing, however a pair of needle-nose pliers and it was easily repaired.",81824,4
81824,For the price it could have been better made.,81824,4
81825,"Comfortable for scrub bottoms, hidden cell phone pocket fits my iPhone perfectly.",81825,4
81825,"There is enough pocket for phone, pens, and gloves.",81825,4
81825,I have long legs and these pants didn't fall short.,81825,4
81826,High quality rain boot with a very cute design.,81826,4
81826,If they had some arch support they would earn 10 stars from us!!,81826,4
81829,The earrings are WAY too big but I absolutely LOVE the necklace!,81829,4
81830,Material is very thin but the jacket is cute and makes a great 50's costume for a reasonable price.,81830,4
81831,"The wife looked excellent in this dress great for the price, highly reccomend.",81831,4
81832,"Very nice quality, runs a little smaller than expected but other than that very happy with my purchase and will definitely be looking into more.",81832,4
81833,for the price this looks quite nice!,81833,4
81833,Looks exactly like the photo.,81833,4
81833,It arrived in just a day or two after I ordered it.,81833,4
81833,and was nicely packaged.,81833,4
81835,"I really liked this romper, and I wear a small or medium, but unfortunately my 34D chest did not work with this romper.",81835,4
81835,I would not recommend if you are larger than a C. Will be returning.,81835,4
81836,i got the asian large because that's a US medium even though I'm smaller for where i live so i should'vs gotten the asian medium,81836,4
81837,This bad holds a lot.,81837,4
81837,It has a separate area for shoes or whatever you don't want to pack in with your clothes.,81837,4
81837,It is fine for my needs.,81837,4
81837,The only negative is that it does not stand on its own.,81837,4
81837,I didn't think I would care but I do.,81837,4
81837,It would be easier to travel with if it did.,81837,4
81838,very cute to wear with shorts!,81838,4
81839,the cut outs were higher than i expected but maybe my torso is longer than girl pictured,81839,4
81840,My sister seems to like them.,81840,4
81840,Look soft oand comfortable,81840,4
81841,"Nice quality, and excellent value.",81841,4

81842,very nice a bit larger than expected,81842,4
81843,These were of good quality.,81843,4
81843,"The material was good,  but they looked a bit small on an adults head.",81843,4
81843,They were very cute and completed out costumes well.,81843,4
81844,Like most things these rings aren't made for big (tall) people.,81844,4
81844,So I can only get them all the way down on my pinky but they're midi rings so they fit alright on the other fingers,81844,4
81845,"back is canvas,not wool, but still looks good.",81845,4
81846,"Kind of dry, don't know how long it will last, but works really well.",81846,4
81846,"Easy to quickly give your shoes a shine, and quick drying.",81846,4
81847,"These are exquisite, but I found out from the first set I bought that the chains were quite fragile.",81847,4
81847,"Even so I replaced then because they look so great, but now I know to treat them with care.",81847,4
81848,They are super cool.,81848,4

81865,For the price it is very nice.,81865,4
81866,"I was looking for a statement necklace and thought this was so pretty, when i received it i still thought it was pretty just not the size i was going for which made me a little upset, but over all its still a very nice necklace",81866,4
81867,The shoes are what i expected for the prices and design as shown in the Advert.,81867,4
81867,Unfair to ask about arch support if someone has special needs in shoes....flat feet?,81867,4
81867,"It is a great product and I am looking to get one in grey ...soon

Kevin B
TCI / Provo",81867,4
81868,Does this just 'scream' COLD & delicate wash cycle or what?!,81868,4
81868,"It's extra ROOMY, so be forewarned if you are a small framed woman, & the threading could use some improvement in the stitching department.",81868,4
81868,"Other than that, it makes for a cute hip-style 70's appeal.",81868,4
81869,I had ordered this in black which fit much better than this one and the manufacturer was not the same??,81869,4
81871,"Very nice case, holds glasses very secure, only problem is the glue is coming off the bottom panel slightly, a tiny drop of gorilla glue fixed it.",81871,4
81872,Good price; they fit well with no lines and seem to launder well.,81872,4
81873,I was expecting it to be bigger but it has a beautiful design,81873,4
81874,It is a little large but will do!,81874,4
81874,Like the material and coziness of it!,81874,4
81875,"Fit well, is 100% polyester not cotton tho",81875,4
81876,"I like this cape It has a nice texture to it and is easy to put on, However the hood is a bit too small for my liking but otherwise it fits well and is perfect for a Wizard or mage costume.",81876,4
81877,"I am a 32DD, and when I opened the package I said ""is this a joke..?""",81877,4
81877,I got the largest size possible and it is tooooo small.,81877,4
81877,But honestly really good quality for the money!,81877,4
81878,"A few loose hems, but for the price that I paid, no complaints!",81878,4
81879,Runs small so order a size up.,81879,4
81879,I usually wear a small so I ordered a medium.,81879,4
81879,Nice novelty piece to display your manly goods.,81879,4
81879,I bought a few in different colors.,81879,4
81879,Should last through a few washes.,81879,4
81879,I cut off that stupid logo that's on the front.,81879,4
81879,It took away from the look.,81879,4
81880,"Ordered size small and was very pleased with the product, it took a while to arrive but worth it.",81880,4
81881,"Yeah, this actually worked pretty well.",81881,4
81881,Way better than some others on here.,81881,4
81881,I recommend it if you don't need any kind of support (I don't).,81881,4
81882,It was a better quality than I had expected.,81882,4
81882,I am very happy with my purchase,81882,4
81883,Not as sparkling as in the pictures though.,81883,4
81883,Wish they make smaller sizes.,81883,4
81884,The product is beautiful!!!,81884,4
81884,It was delivered in 3 days as expected.,81884,4
81885,I really love this and wear it all the time; 4 stars because I had to use pliers to make it fit properly.,81885,4
81886,"wife loved it,..its hello kitty nuff said",81886,4
81887,great shirt for the price,81887,4
81888,My 4 year-old son loves these boots because the front zipper opens the boot wide so he can easily put them on and off himself.,81888,4
81888,"Also, they are light enough for him to run around comfortably.",81888,4
81888,We have not yet tested them in snow or ice so I can't speak to that.,81888,4
81889,I have a bad back and slouching makes it worse.,81889,4
81889,This works well at least temporarily to alleviate some of my discomfort.,81889,4
81889,"It does roll up annoying, but I think I'm slightly short-waisted.",81889,4
81891,"Is Beautiful, always check the size, run small, and is short.",81891,4
81891,but the Fabric is Perfect.,81891,4
81892,Nice shirt but fits more like a tight 1x,81892,4
81895,"It is a very cute overall skirt outfit but I was hoping it reached to the knees at least, a little shorter than I prefer.",81895,4
81895,Going to keep it since it is the second one I've ordered.,81895,4
81895,I ordered a size up in hopes the length would be longer but not much difference.,81895,4
81895,I think the skirt part is just meant to be short.,81895,4
81895,I will pair it with leggings and maybe some cute boots.,81895,4
81895,Good quality and the kitten patch is super cute!,81895,4
81895,My daughter really likes it.,81895,4
81895,She is 5 1/2.,81895,4
81895,I ordered a size 7 even though she border line between 6 and 7.,81895,4
81896,"The top is fine, I ordered my size but still a bit too small for the bottom.",81896,4
81896,The bottom is see through so...be careful.,81896,4
81897,Good hat to keep head warm.,81897,4
81900,"From someone who shops at nicer retailers, this is a great bargain for the quality!",81900,4
81900,"Small fit perfect - I am 5'2"" and 110 lbs",81900,4
81901,"Everyone reviewed how large it was
But mine ran a bit small but will work okay
Quality is good",81901,4
81902,The only thing is I thought it would be just a little bigger but luckily I was able to fit everything in it.,81902,4
81903,"I read the reviews and decided to go with one size up, so I went with an XL.",81903,4
81903,Waist flattering when tied to the back or you can cut the straps and replace with a wide belt to give a pop of color.,81903,4
81903,"The V neck didn't cut very low on me, but hey I'm a shorty w/DD's so it worked for me (LOL!).",81903,4
81903,"Shorts not too short, doesn't fit tight.",81903,4
81903,I would definitely buy this item again.,81903,4
81906,Due to the sizing information ordered per the websites instructions.,81906,4
81906,"We expected the dress to be large in the bust area however, it seems that additional material was additionally added in the bust and the waist.",81906,4
81906,My daughter is having a seamstress make the adjustments to reduce it down to her size.,81906,4
81907,nice and don't hurt babies head,81907,4
81908,I really like this little tunic.,81908,4
81908,I wear it over half length tights and it's super comfortable and cute.,81908,4
81909,This skirt is more gorgeous in person very long and flowy a little see through but in a terrible way.,81909,4
81909,One star off because of the miscommunications with the company of when the skirt would actually come.,81909,4
81910,Ordered a small and it fit well.,81910,4
81910,Provides the little bit of extra coverage/distraction I wanted for my tights that have a bit of stretch marks.,81910,4
81910,For reference I wear a size 26/27 in Silver jeans and size 2 in J Crew shorts.,81910,4
81911,I ordered this in XL and they were too big.,81911,4
81911,I could have ordered a Large and they would have fit fine.,81911,4
81911,Right now I'm a size 12-14.,81911,4
81911,They are very comfortable,81911,4
81912,It came really early.,81912,4
81912,"It looks exactly like the quality you pay for, but it passes really well for a simple addition to a casual outfit!",81912,4
81913,This does not need to be stored on a hanger as it will stretch out the shoulders.,81913,4
81914,Seems to be a nicely made product.,81914,4
81914,"The buckle is a little shinier than I expected, but still looks good, and everything works well.",81914,4
81914,I was a little worried when I cut the end and a bit of the stitching unravelled.,81914,4
81914,"Fortunately, I was very conservative, and can cut a lot more.",81914,4
81914,"Next time, I'll use a very sharp knife instead of scissors and see if that works better.",81914,4
81914,I might also add a tiny bit of glue to prevent any unravelling.,81914,4
81914,"I don't know if it would be a problem, but it won't hurt.",81914,4
81914,The buckle seems to be a little too big for the belt size.,81914,4
81914,Maybe it would also work with a 1 1/2 inch belt.,81914,4
81914,"While this isn't really a problem, it makes it a little harder to make sure the buckle is straight on the belt, unless you attach the belt at the very top or bottom.",81914,4
81916,"I like the texture, but a little to thight with shoes.",81916,4
81916,I will order the same brand but the 3/4.,81916,4
81918,I was able to wear these for about three months before they began ripping at the seams.,81918,4
81918,Served it's purpose though for training and my half marathon,81918,4
81920,Lays nicely on a pear shaped body type,81920,4
81921,I like the drape but it is not as long as it is in the picture.,81921,4
81921,I have gotten compliments every time I have worn it.,81921,4
81922,Very cute and flattering style even though slightly small.,81922,4
81923,This tunic dress is soo cute!!!,81923,4
81923,Loved the ruffles at the bottom.,81923,4
81923,As far as sizing...,81923,4
81923,I know it is supposed to be a loose fit but i think it ran a little big.,81923,4
81923,I usually wear an xl in everything so i orderd an xl.,81923,4
81923,It fit but was slighty loose.,81923,4
81923,I wish i would have ordered a large instead.,81923,4
81923,I wanted to do an exchange but the large was out of stock.,81923,4
81923,I ended up returning it only because i did feel it was too loose for an xl.,81923,4
81923,I may purchase again when there is more in stock in large.,81923,4
81924,"It's a good hat, not stiff enough, but it's Okay.",81924,4
81926,My daughter lovers her robe!,81926,4
81926,"The slippers are a bit flimsy, but were easily repaired.",81926,4
81927,I'm using my red one as a cross body purse as there are times I just don't want to drag a big purse around.,81927,4
81927,"When I want to go back to a big one, I could just tuck this inside the big one.",81927,4
81927,The red is perfect with jeans.,81927,4
81927,It appears to be real leather exterior and the lining fabric is better than most.,81927,4
81927,But it smelled horrible!,81927,4
81927,I don't know if the included lavender sachet is meant to cover up the smell?,81927,4
81927,I think it made the smell worse as the sachet pretty much smelled like the purse by this point.,81927,4
81927,"I aired it out 2 days, sprayed it with 2X strong Febreeze; it still has an odor, its just a fraction more manageable now.",81927,4
81927,"With that smell I'll be assured never to lose my purse, just follow the smell!",81927,4
81928,"Little big for my head but for $5, can't complain.",81928,4
81929,Perfect for the costume we needed it for.,81929,4
81929,Like others have said they do run at least a full size small so make sure to order a larger than normal size.,81929,4
81930,"Very unique hoodie, while it's not super thick it does provide some warmth.",81930,4
81930,It's kinda perfect for Florida weather (which is where I live) the material looks high quality and it's stitched beautifully.,81930,4
81930,"The pockets are where the zippers are, the flap with button is just for show.",81930,4
81930,"My only complaint is the zipper, it feels cheap and sometimes snags.",81930,4
81930,I could see this potentially breaking if not too careful.,81930,4
81930,Also being that the pockets are behind the zippers makes for a rough feel if you have your hands in there.,81930,4
81930,Thus why I only gave 4 stars but I would recommend to anyone who doesn't live in the snow.,81930,4
81931,I'm going to use it as a pattern to make it bigger.,81931,4
81932,"Ordered larger thinking they run smaller, but is a little bigger than I like.",81932,4
81934,It is okay for the price.,81934,4
81934,The sea shells were very big.,81934,4
81934,I might have to take some off because it is heavy and bulk.,81934,4
81934,But I will wear it when I got to casual places.,81934,4
81934,I received it very quickly,81934,4
81936,I love them but they are somewhat on the small side.,81936,4
81937,I liked them but they sent me a pair that had been used.,81937,4
81937,Mot new like stated.,81937,4
81937,I was so dissipointed I returned them.,81937,4
81937,It make me nervous to buy them again.,81937,4
81937,Someone tried to remove tom ford from lens.,81937,4
81937,So I could not go for that.,81937,4
81937,But the glasses or beautiful !,81937,4
81938,It looks great just a little tight.,81938,4
81939,"A little smaller than the other ones I bought, but still great quality",81939,4
81940,"Still a nice hat, but it is a little small for my head.",81940,4
81942,"I originally got this top,  in another color,  from a different seller,  and the fit was perfect.",81942,4
81942,When I ordered this top I assumed the fit would be the same...it wasn't.,81942,4
81942,"While it's not bad, it IS a bit smaller than the other brand.",81942,4
81945,Product was as described.,81945,4
81946,The case is great well optics work well if you can keep them on your nose.,81946,4
81947,I used it as a purse for a few days!,81947,4
81947,It held everything I needed it too!,81947,4
81948,"Judging by the stock photos versus the photos posted in another review, I knew before buying that this bag is a replica of the bag shown in the pictures and that those stock photos don't really belong to this seller.",81948,4
81948,I will say though that this is certainly great quality for a replica and a great price!,81948,4
81948,"I received the bag more than a week before the expected delivery date, which was a pleasant surprise, and it just happened to arrive the day before a friend of mine died so it's been very comforting having this big bunny to hold onto while my real life bunny is living back home in another state and can only comfort me through skype.",81948,4
81948,One of the biggest reasons I bought this bag was because it has lots of room to hold things (which most stuffed animal bags really do not) and it definitely does not fail me in that regard.,81948,4
81948,"I can fit my water bottle (which is medium to large), wallet (which is on the large side), keys, makeup, notebook (as in a paper one, not a laptop), and tablet in the main pocket with room left over for a small snack or some pads/tampons and my phone, comb and clipper card fit perfectly into the small pocket in the back (it's also a perfect spot to put something like a condom that you wouldn't want being shown to the world every time you unzip your purse).",81948,4
81948,Everything kind of slides down into the belly of the bunny so you can feel your stuff when you poke the belly.,81948,4
81948,"The cuteness factor is also on point, this bag would definitely fit well with sweet lolita and fairy kei styles and oddly enough, it poses a kind of awesome, ""so off it works"" opposition in punk, goth and cult pary kei styles.",81948,4
81948,"My favorite part, appearance-wise, in the stock photos was the blush on the bunny's cheeks which the actual bag I received did not have so I ended up putting some of my own blush on the cheeks and while it brushes off and I have to reapply it every week or so, worked pretty well and looks very cute.",81948,4
81948,"The material of the bag is very very soft and of pretty good quality, the lining  inside is a little thin/cheap so I would be careful about putting things with sharp edges like a mechanical pencil inside so that the lining doesn't rip.",81948,4
81948,The zipper also seems a tad bit cheap so I would definitely recommend being gentle with it and not over-stuffing the bag.,81948,4
81948,"Overall the bag is so cute that I can't stop taking pictures of it and perfectly bridges my needs for practicality, novelty and style.",81948,4
81948,So many pictures below:,81948,4
81949,Smaller than I expected but very cute and fashionable .,81949,4
81950,"Excellent,  Was fast delivery.",81950,4
81951,"As with all Asian-sized clothing, it is imperative that you take very careful measurements and match them to the sizing chart.",81951,4
81951,"By doing that, we got the perfect fit in the shoulders, arms, and bust.",81951,4
81951,"In spite of the careful measuring, however, this blouse is still too short for typical American length.",81951,4
81951,It does not reach loosely to the hips the way it does on the model.,81951,4
81951,Plan on wearing a a tank or something underneath to keep the midriff covered.,81951,4
81951,"Having said that, this blouse is very pretty with the ruffled neckline and the pleated sleeves.",81951,4
81951,"One bonus is that the  expected date of arrival was about 6 weeks after I ordered it, and it actually came in less than half that time.",81951,4
81952,They fit nice good for water parks mostly,81952,4
81953,This is a nice outfit.,81953,4
81953,The shorts fit nicely.,81953,4
81953,"My one and only complaint is that the clamp on the back of the shirt, which is similar to the bra clasp, is incorrect.",81953,4
81953,The connecting parts are on the same side.,81953,4
81953,For anyone who wears a bra or knows how a bra clamp works (one on the outside and one on the inside of the fabric) would understand that this is a major design flaw.,81953,4
81953,"So every time I wear this top, the back is twisted.",81953,4
81953,"I'm not sure if this is a flaw on all, but it's definitely worth mentioning.",81953,4
81953,"I am 5'5"" 135 pounds and I ordered a Medium.",81953,4
81955,these are acceptable socks for the price; a bit thin for winter wear,81955,4
81956,ONly complaint is the zipper picks my neck when it is zipped up.,81956,4
81956,For that money I feel the zipper could be a bit more wearable.,81956,4
81957,Is nice size soft leather bag.,81957,4
81958,"Not as long as I expected, but it still fits great.",81958,4
81959,Thought I was ordering navy for summer but in the bright sun the tops I ordered appears black print-bummer otherwise the tops fit well when I went up a size from a medium.... ordered a large to accommodate the hips!!!,81959,4
81960,"Good quality, true to size.",81960,4
81961,These are so cute.,81961,4
81961,Love to wear them out with the girls for a night out.,81961,4
81961,Not recommended to wear all the time.,81961,4
81961,They can damage easy and may turn colors on itself or your skin.,81961,4
81963,"Love this bra, but too small.",81963,4
81963,It lifts and shapes in all the right places.,81963,4
81963,"I purchased a 38c, so probably a 40c would have worked.",81963,4
81964,Very nice hat and well packaged when sent to me.,81964,4
81965,Sleeves shorter than as pictured otherwise nice dress.,81965,4
81965,Just a little thin on the black area.,81965,4
81965,Quite stretchy which also means a body shaper is recommended to smooth out any lines.,81965,4
81968,"I got a kids size one for myself and the arms fit perfect
And the only thing was that the legs were short by like an inch and the tale was down really low
But other than that it was adorable",81968,4
81969,This is my second purchase of this band.,81969,4
81969,Wearing it on a daily basis I hand wash it in cool water with woolite and air dry it.,81969,4
81969,"Dries fast, but loses its nap which gives it its grip, then you wind up with it up on the top of your head, and of course you have wig slippage.",81969,4
81969,But I do like it better than another brand that has a large label you have to line up near your right ear!,81969,4
81969,"Its really wide and tends to show at the hairline, for me anyway!",81969,4
81969,Give this a try..you can always return it.,81969,4
81970,It has however continued to stretch quite a bit so that I am now on the last hole.,81970,4
81970,"No biggie, I can always make more holes.",81970,4
81972,"Very beautiful, but they were a little too big for me.",81972,4
81973,They look baggy enough in the picture soak I thought XL would be good.,81973,4
81973,I'm 6 4 175lbs and I was wrong.,81973,4
81974,Way flimsier than I anticipated.,81974,4
81974,"I was expecting some level of support with all those straps, but since they're such light elastic, there wasn't much at all.",81974,4
81974,"Altogether, it fit reasonably well once I took the pads out( which is hard to find-most generic sizes don't accommodate a 32DD).",81974,4
81974,"I'm not sure if I'll be able to wear it out in public, but it's really comfy for around the house.",81974,4
81975,"Really pretty, came like what you see in the picture.",81975,4
81975,But it's a bit tight and it has more of a costume jewelry look.,81975,4
81975,But it's still very cute.,81975,4
81975,Is stretchy so you can slip it over your foot.,81975,4
81975,No clasp which is comfortable.,81975,4
81976,As far as the quality goes- it is as expected.,81976,4
81976,None of mine had loose thread or tearing.,81976,4
81976,"My only complaint is that the green I orders is much darker than the photo, it's almost a forest green.",81976,4
81976,"So be warned that the color isn't quite as cutesy and pastel like the images, but overall I am pleased with the product.",81976,4
81977,It's the the color I was expecting.,81977,4
81977,It says it's a light pink color.,81977,4
81977,But I got a bright pink color instead.,81977,4
81977,"Nonetheless, it still looks cute.",81977,4
81977,And I'm still happy with the purchase.,81977,4
81978,Said 3x but it is a bit tight compared to the Mountain t shirts 3x.,81978,4
81978,But I love that the design is on both sides.,81978,4
81978,I will have to loose a few lbs.,81978,4
81978,before I can wear it.,81978,4
81979,"We had these pants before, so we knew what we were gettting.",81979,4
81979,"My son generally likes looser fitting pants, and these legs are somewhat tighter.",81979,4
81979,"That being said, we bought these becausee we like the quality, fabric and weaarability.",81979,4
81979,They are a good product.,81979,4
81980,I like it but its too small...my daughter threw away all packaging before trying it on so I have no idea how to exchange it.,81980,4
81982,"Nice outfit, the material could be a little bit more quality, but it's still pretty nice.",81982,4
81984,Ordered a 2X and its more like a large or a close to XL fits like a compression T even though its not.,81984,4
81985,difficult to clasp otherwise would have rated 5 of 5,81985,4
81986,good cap for the price,81986,4
81987,"Perfect shape, color - well made & well priced.",81987,4
81988,These sizes run extremely small.,81988,4
81988,"I am 5'3"" 36"" bust, 29"" waist and 36"" hips.",81988,4
81988,My weight is 123 pounds.,81988,4
81988,"I ordered a Large due to comments on small sizing, but need to order an XL.",81988,4
81988,"Good fabric, good color, but just too small.",81988,4
81991,"Did not read carefully that it says ""Florida"" on it.",81991,4
81991,"There are two, and they are cute, average mugs.",81991,4
81992,so cute but scratchy,81992,4
81993,"The silver embellishments on the sleeves are cheap pieces of plastic, could probably break easily if you're not careful but overall I can't complain for 6 bucks.",81993,4
81993,I ordered a size up & it fits.,81993,4
81995,i did like this but the shorts are very thin !,81995,4
81995,and bad material but when i put it on  my daughter it actually looked nice the shirt was a great material n cute fit it was to cold for the shorts that day but the shirt is very cute,81995,4
81996,"Pants are great quality and very nice pants, only negative is that Carhardt must run small because every other pair of 34x30 are loose fitting but these are snug.",81996,4
81996,Yet still a great pair of quality pants,81996,4
81997,Good to go.. thanks,81997,4
81998,"Wish that the bottom two buttons allowed you to place tuxedo stud in, instead of a white button.",81998,4
81998,If you are not wearing a cumber band then the bottom two buttons do not match the rest of the shirt.,81998,4
81999,Overall it's pretty great.,81999,4
81999,Great durability and size for the most part.,81999,4
81999,I wish the pockets on side were just a little bigger.,81999,4
81999,"I cant seem to fit many things in there, but maybe I just stuff the interior too full.",81999,4
82000,these are more so like tights than leggings but still comfy to wear!,82000,4
82002,Was a little bit shorter than I expected but it's still cute to wear with shorts or tights.,82002,4
82002,Great buy for the price,82002,4
82004,I normally would take between a 1X and a 2X I ordered the largest size they have which was a 4X and that's still too small otherwise it's very nice,82004,4
82005,I was 37 in waist right after labor and had to wait a week before it could fit me.,82005,4
82005,I'm now 34 and ordered a small.,82005,4
82005,"Fits great, I'm 5' tall and feel like its the right length for me.",82005,4
82006,Nice anklet jus had it for ah few day so don't no about the fading yet...but for d price it's ok,82006,4
82007,but I it have a few cons.,82007,4
82007,"1:you cant move anything on the gun exept for the trigger
2:it is only for one time use
3:the sound of the blast cuts off at the end.",82007,4
82007,but either then that its great!,82007,4
82008,Like it but it's tangled easily,82008,4
82009,I'll let you know about warmth when I return from Serbia.,82009,4
82010,Great product for the price.,82010,4
82011,"These are very comfortable and fit well, just a little loose in the knees.",82011,4
82011,I think they'd be perfect if I ordered a size down.,82011,4
82011,They look good though!,82011,4
82011,I recommend these to anyone looking for easy and comfortable style.,82011,4
82012,"very cute, seem durable!",82012,4
82012,"have had 2 of them in, one in an ear hole and the other in my nose, and neither has tarnished.",82012,4
82012,i have really sensitive skin and piercings and these rings didn't bother me.,82012,4
82012,they do run big but i was able to bend it in some for a smaller fit.,82012,4
82012,the rings are pretty and i get compliments all the time on the colorful one!,82012,4
82013,I looked at all the reviews before ordering to try to determine the best size.,82013,4
82013,I think a size smaller would have been tight.,82013,4
82013,My suggestion is to order your normal size.,82013,4
82014,This swim suit is amazingly cute!,82014,4
82014,Only reason why it's getting 4 stars is because my bottoms were kind of big.,82014,4
82015,"Pretty but a little bit too big, had to return",82015,4
82016,Like this because the color is neutral so matches with all swimwear.,82016,4
82017,The cuffs are huge.,82017,4
82017,Sleeves fall down over hands.,82017,4
82018,"This dress was adorable, just a bit big on my small 7 year old.",82018,4
82018,I ordered a size 6 in the dress and we still had to tack it up so it didn't fall off her shoulders.,82018,4
82018,"However, my daughter is pretty small.",82018,4
82018,"I loved the color of the dress, the quality was great, just a bit large but I took care of that.",82018,4
82019,"Very cute, but has a slightly pinkish tinge (not off-white like photos) and fits quite a bit tighter than what I expected, and I ordered up a size on instinct.",82019,4
82019,"I wanted more of a loose, thin sweater and this is more like a tightish night-shirt.",82019,4
82019,Arrived several days early!,82019,4
82020,Was a little shorter than I thought but very pretty,82020,4
82021,It's not the product's fault!,82021,4
82022,"Fits as advertised, good product",82022,4
82023,"I liked this product, but I only gave it 4 stars because it was much to big for my wrist, and although it is somewhat adjustable even on the shortest link it was still too big.",82023,4
82024,The bottoms were smaller than I anticipated but over all it fit.,82024,4
82026,Very nice but wish it was a little better quality... As a Vietnam Helicopter Crew Chief/Gunner.it will serve it's purpose.,82026,4
82027,These are pretty but don't stay up all day.,82027,4
82027,"Even though they run small, they have enough elasticity.",82027,4
82027,"The waist isn't big, It fits just right when I put it on, but the material is somewhat too sleek that it rolls down over the cause of time or as you move.",82027,4
82027,The length can be another problem for tall girls,82027,4
82028,4xl is a USA large.,82028,4
82029,"Cute, great price and quality.",82029,4
82029,Medium is a little tight but is probably due to the quilting and style of jacket.,82029,4
82029,Didn't want to spend a lot on a jacket since I only need a jacket occasionally in Southern California.,82029,4
82030,Very small..perfect for second earing hole..or little.girl..sparkle..bright and very.pretty.. Just very tiny..,82030,4
82031,"Nice make up bag, but I wish zipper is better made.",82031,4
82031,Zipper is not smooth.,82031,4
82032,This is a nice vest.,82032,4
82032,Fit for medium was perfect and easily adjustable by using the little fabric belt on the back.,82032,4
82032,I'm discounting one star because of the buttons.,82032,4
82032,"They are cover with fabric, which is nice, but they are a bit too big and heavy fit the stitching used.",82032,4
82033,"I am not a hat wearer, so the hat was bit awkward for me.",82033,4
82033,"That being said, it was easy to wear due to it's light weight and style and it did a great job keeping the sun off me.",82033,4
82033,"The size fit as expected, was easy to pack and kept it's shape.",82033,4
82033,"Came in great condition, and is still in great condition, no loose stitching.",82033,4
82033,I am definitely glad I got it to wear while down in Mexico.,82033,4
82033,Would recommend to friends and family.,82033,4
82034,My son wore this as a ring  bearer at my cousins wedding he was so cute and matched the groom exactly!,82034,4
82034,One thing I did not know though is it is dry clean only we did not realize that and try to iron it which caused it to dapple a little but it still looked good the tie was very convenient and did not bother his neck at all,82034,4
82035,Thick fabric but ran a little small and was a little short waisted for my son.,82035,4
82035,Would have been better for a woman's fit.,82035,4
82036,"Nice design, bright colors.",82036,4
82036,"I wish it was a little longer, but most Hawaiian shirts are cut short.",82036,4
82037,This bra arrived in only a week and a half while Amazon said it would take 4 weeks to get here.,82037,4
82037,I ordered an XL and the strap around the ribcage was TOO small.,82037,4
82037,Fortunately I have some sewing skills and I added an extra 5 inches of lace fabric to the strap so I could actually wear it.,82037,4
82037,It is really comfortable and very sexy.,82037,4
82037,It does offer me nipple protection which I was kind of skeptical of but It hides them!,82037,4
82037,No underwire but the straps do get to hold the girls comfortably!,82037,4
82037,"I thought  this was definitely a steal even though I had to add a little bit of extra fabric, but I will definitely buy another one since it is the most sexiest bra top I own!",82037,4
82037,"For my plus size gals and big chested girls, I do NOT recommend  this since the girls will fall out or the ribcage strap will not be able to clasp.",82037,4
82038,"Overall, a nice looking pirate shirt but a bit thin.",82038,4
82038,You might want to order one size larger than normal.,82038,4
82038,"Pros:
Nice looking pirate shirt

Cons:
Material is a bit thin

Other Thoughts:
The description doesn't mention it but the shirt I received is 65% poly / 35% cotton and is tagged dry clean only.",82038,4
82038,My guess is the manufacturer tagged it dry clean only because the material is a bit thin and the construction won't hold up to too many washings.,82038,4
82038,"That said, I'm planning to wash it at home anyway since it smells a bit stale.",82038,4
82038,I normally wear a medium but I wanted to make sure this shirt wasn't too tight so I ordered a large and it was a good thing I did.,82038,4
82038,The large fits well.,82038,4
82038,A little loose but not too baggy.,82038,4
82039,"Adorable, bought for a Halloween costume, still plays dress up with it today.",82039,4
82039,"The thin plastic eye google part did fall out of one side after 1st use, I had to glue it back on.",82039,4
82040,The scarf is just what I expected and desired.,82040,4
82040,"It could be a bit heavier, but fits the bill.",82040,4
82040,It is soft and comfortable as advertised.,82040,4
82040,The pattern is also just as depicted.,82040,4
82041,My daughter loved it but I wish it came in bigger sizes...had to send back.,82041,4
82041,She is theoretically a 32B but this was way small cup size.,82041,4
82042,It feels as if some is cradling the goods.,82042,4
82042,"They are comfortable, keeping everything in place.",82042,4
82042,"I am unhappy about the delivery being several days late, and I feel maybe if you got two pair this would be worth it.",82042,4
82042,"As is, they are pricey, but when I win the lottery I'll buy the company and reduce the price because these are comfy and I wish I had had them when I deployed overseas.",82042,4
82043,"It reduced 40 percent of my discomfort  heels
That make me got the 2nd pair",82043,4
82044,My wife loves these shirts.,82044,4
82044,They fit well and are a great price.,82044,4
82044,Very soft and don't shrink with waking and drying.,82044,4
82044,My wife was even able to wear it comfortably while pregnant without stretching it out.,82044,4
82045,It just didn't fit right.,82045,4
82045,It made my belly look big.,82045,4
82046,The Mocs are beautiful and well made.,82046,4
82046,"We have a chunky baby with no ankles, so these booties wouldn't strap closed.",82046,4
82047,I'm very pleased with the product.,82047,4
82049,If you love thongs (like I do) you'll love these.,82049,4
82049,"I usually wear sz Small, but Ive tried Med also, not much diff in size.",82049,4
82049,The pouch size can differ from one pr to another so buy more than one pr before you judge them.,82049,4
82049,"Short duration wearing is great but all day wearing you may find, as I have, that your thin ball skin will start pushing through the holes in the fabric : not comfortable, almost painful !",82049,4
82049,I wish the company would make narrow seat bikinis like these !,82049,4
82050,Wow this swimsuit is tiny!,82050,4
82050,I can't believe this is advertised as one-size-fits all!,82050,4
82050,"This is coming from a small woman, so it is only somewhat small for me but would be impossible for an average to large sized person to wear.",82050,4
82050,"The suit technically fits in that I can fit it on my body, but the bottoms are teeny tiny and pretty much fit like a thong bikini.",82050,4
82050,"That being said, I still really like the swimsuit and think it's really cute.",82050,4
82050,I just have to reserve wearing it for times when I'm not self-conscious about people seeing my entire booty!,82050,4
82050,"The craftsmanship is also very good, it seems like a well-made garment.",82050,4
82050,"So, if you're looking for a tiny little swimsuit to really show off your body, I would recommend this.",82050,4
82051,My 5 year old son loves it.,82051,4
82051,It is a bit big for him but he will grow into it.,82051,4
82052,"Great looking, light frames.",82052,4
82052,"the hinge is very durable, but the plastic connection between the temples to the frame is dubious.",82052,4
82052,"It has snapped on me, but some super glue and it's holding up just fine.",82052,4
82052,Just a concern about longevity.,82052,4
82053,I purchased the copper color -- it was exactly as shown and very pretty.,82053,4
82053,"Both the fit and the quality was nice - I am 5'5, 140 pounds and they fit perfectly.",82053,4
82053,"However, I needed a pair of ""leggings"", and these were more like opaque footless tights - you would need to wear a top that reaches your mid-thigh in order to cover your rear.",82053,4
82053,"I definitely am going to order this same brand again in the 'winter' version, which says it has a light fleece lining - I'm hoping they will be somewhat heavier.",82053,4
82053,I am impressed with the wide range of colors available - just waiting for the weather to get a bit cooler before heading into the fleece pair.,82053,4
82054,The material was a lil thin but would be great with leggings or slip underneath.,82054,4
82055,looks and wears as expected,82055,4
82056,The dress fit me perfectly.,82056,4
82056,"I usually buy a medium, but I bought a large since it said that it comes a bit small.",82056,4
82057,I like all the slots for cards and slim design.,82057,4
82059,I am devastated because this was ADORABLE in person and I really wanted it to fit.,82059,4
82059,"I ordered it knowing that the cup size was smaller than what I generally wear, but I thought I'd give it a chance for the price and style.",82059,4
82059,The band fit perfectly and as I said I love the pattern in person.,82059,4
82059,"Unfortunately, my large chest spilled all over and it looked like I was wearing a preteen's swim top.",82059,4
82059,I am going to see if I can find this suit with a larger cup for sure!,82059,4
82060,Glad I sized down based on everyone's comments of it running a size big.,82060,4
82060,I'm an 8-10 on top and 10-12 on bottom.,82060,4
82060,Size Medium fit perfect.,82060,4
82061,They could be slightly larger.,82061,4
82061,But I get lots of complements on them!,82061,4
82062,This thing is so cute and my husband says I look adorable in this style.,82062,4
82062,"In some places the metal attachments don't look too great up close, but otherwise it's a cute outfit and can be worn to a store or casual setting.",82062,4
82063,My daughter likes it for dress up.,82063,4
82063,Seems like it is decent quality.,82063,4
82064,"Purchased M/L for slender, 5'6"" 14-yr-old.",82064,4
82064,She finds them comfortable.,82064,4
82065,The shirt fits well and looks great!,82065,4
82066,"I loved this dress, it had good detail and was good quality.",82066,4
82066,I ordered and xl based off the reviews but it ended up being too large.,82066,4
82066,I think a L would have worked.,82066,4
82066,"I am 5'7"" and I am 175.",82066,4
82066,I gave the dress away instead of dealing with a return.,82066,4
82067,"The thumb hole is slightly small for my hands, and I have normal-sized guy hands.",82067,4
82067,"After a few hours of use, the skin between my thumb and hand hurt, so I had to modify them so that the thumb hole was bigger.",82067,4
82067,"Other than that, they keep my hands warm at work nicely; I have a desk job and I don't move my hands much but I type a lot and these are perfect for that.",82067,4
82068,good value for price,82068,4
82069,"The fabric is not the best quality, but for the price its perfect.",82069,4
82069,I bought XL because was told this clothes came small but it fit me a little bit large.,82069,4
82069,I normally use L.,82069,4
82070,Good material but very small for my 5.,82070,4
82071,"I wear these at home mainly with my slippers, but because they are not to bulky, I was able to wear with shoes.",82071,4
82071,Most of my shoes are snug because I only wear nylon stockings with them.,82071,4
82072,Dress is definitely pretty but xs is actually more like small size :( had to return it,82072,4
82073,"this pattern, a little tight at the top.",82073,4
82073,I have others that fit just fine.,82073,4
82075,Beautiful...Fits just like the picture and I'm so in love,82075,4
82076,The leggings  are not truly opaque but I will wear them anyway with a pair of girlie boxers underneath.,82076,4
82076,Awesome print and super comfy.,82076,4
82077,Very cute but just too big and long for me.,82077,4
82079,seem very good will have to wait for  cold weather to see if they keep warm,82079,4
82080,"Nice quality,fits well, but be aware it is very low cut.",82080,4
82082,Love it..looks like the pic and metal is vibrant,82082,4
82083,We purchased these for our 2 month old.,82083,4
82083,She weighs 11 lbs.,82083,4
82083,These reusable swim diapers fit perfectly.,82083,4
82083,I would recommend this product to others.,82083,4
82084,"The color is not as bright as seen in the photo, but it is still a beautiful shawl.",82084,4
82085,Just a little tight if I wear more than one layer under.,82085,4
82085,Cut the lining in the back to make a bit more room.,82085,4
82085,Coat is very cute and I get many compliments.,82085,4
82086,I like the look but the arms of it are way to small had to alter them,82086,4
82087,"Very comfy shoe, a little longer than expected but probably the shape of the toe adding to this feeling.",82087,4
82087,A thick sock did the job of correcting size.,82087,4
82087,Maybe a little expensive for canvas shoes but comfort is great.,82087,4
82088,Great insoles with excellent arch support that I use in multiple shoes for multiple activities.,82088,4
82088,They lasted me a little under a year before I had to replace them but I work on my feet and am moving around a lot so they might last others longer.,82088,4
82088,You might have to trim them a little depending on the shoe you're wearing them with but that's easy to do with a good pair of scissors.,82088,4
82089,"Cool for the price, the bead looks -looks like a glow in the dark bead like you'd get with a children's bracelet kit but without the hole.",82089,4
82089,But looks nice enough for an adult on a casual day,82089,4
82090,great product but a bit short,82090,4
82091,Sexey style.however they are better under pants.,82091,4
82091,"I woul have to place my hands over my package,if I were to use these on the beach.",82091,4
82092,I like the fact that it stretches with my belly button and doesn't hurt like the metal one does.,82092,4
82092,"But it's a little long and it gets caught on stuff sometimes, I should have found a shorter one.",82092,4
82093,This is a very flattering skirt that hugs the right curves.,82093,4
82093,"If you are like me and have a bit of a 'muffin top"" situation, pair this with a loose fitting top.",82093,4
82093,It still looks very sexy.,82093,4
82094,This was very cute.,82094,4
82094,The top is made of sheer lace with a heavier embroidery throughout.,82094,4
82094,The sleeves are bell sleeves and will not stay up if pushed up and they do seem extra long.,82094,4
82094,The length of the tunic was great for wearing with leggings.,82094,4
82094,"I ordered an XL and could have ordered a L, I usually wear a L top, I am about 5'3"" and about 150lbs.",82094,4
82094,The only thing I didn't like was it was heavier than I expected and I felt too hot in it even though it was a sheer material.,82094,4
82094,I got it cheaper here on Amazon then I saw this same top in a department store for a lot more.,82094,4
82094,I will order another in the cooler weather,82094,4
82095,The sizes are not the same in the different products,82095,4
82096,So cute just doesn't fit a lot.,82096,4
82096,Maybe credit card and lipstick that's about it!,82096,4
82096,Comes with two different length chain straps or you can wear as clutch.,82096,4
82097,I misplaced my wedding ring and bought this as a (hopefully) temporary place holder .,82097,4
82097,"The price was definitely right, and it shines beautifully, much like my mother's white gold wedding band.",82097,4
82097,"The comfort fit is great, very smooth, the band slides on the finger well.",82097,4
82097,"This ring is very heavy however, it really is a substantial piece of jewelry!",82097,4
82097,"So it might not be a good choice for those with more dainty fingers, but especially for men who want a solid feeling band, you will like this ring.",82097,4
82098,Fits well but the transparent material has very little stretch.,82098,4
82099,It doesn't boost my itty bitties very well but I do love the way it fits my body other than that.,82099,4
82100,"I like these sunglasses, even though they are not the most stylish ones out there.",82100,4
82100,They work for my purposes.,82100,4
82102,Nice abs perfect for a gif.,82102,4
82103,Nice material i ordered a medium but they sent a large don't really mind tho still an awesome shirt,82103,4
82104,"Could maybe size up, but still really cute!",82104,4
82105,I always wanted a quilted bag and I got this with a very reasonable price.,82105,4
82105,Not cheap texture and the bags were sewed in so nice no extra clothes or strings left.,82105,4
82105,Just the one u will love to carry wherever you go.,82105,4
82107,"I was satisfied, the dress is beautiful, the yellow was shine.",82107,4
82107,The ladies were cute at my wedding.,82107,4
82107,I think i made a precious choice.,82107,4
82108,I love the sexiness of the top.,82108,4
82108,"My one complaint is that the part that ties, does not come down as far as shown in the picture.",82108,4
82108,"Other than that, the color is perfect.",82108,4
82109,A bit bigger than I wanted; but was able to decrease the width by tightening the side straps.,82109,4
82110,This shipped and received as expected.,82110,4
82110,I purchased a size larger than normal and this fit perfect.,82110,4
82110,I wore it (yesterday out on a boat)for the first time and found it very comfortable.,82110,4
82110,It is a bit thin and there is no liner which wouldn't be a problem if I was wearing this as bike shorts but I purchased it for the beach.,82110,4
82110,Haven't worn it in the water so I can not rate that situation.,82110,4
82111,Pants fit well - true to size/measurements - they do make a swishing noise when you walk though.,82111,4
82111,Like all cellulite creams this one is not miracle - cannot really see much of a result after using up first container.,82111,4
82112,"I have a small foot, woman's size 6; with that said, I was concerned about this sock being far too big, but it does work okay, in fact, they fit snug in the calf which feels great.",82112,4
82112,"When I purchased them I wished they sold them in specifically women's sizes, but I am overall happy after my first wear.",82112,4
82112,I will know better after hiking in them next month.,82112,4
82113,Man these are tiny!,82113,4
82113,"I'm small myself at 5'6"" and 100lbs, they are reeeeally tight!",82113,4
82113,"I'm obviously on the thin side and not very muscular, I imagine they would be near impossible to get on if your legs were on the more muscular side.",82113,4
82113,"That being said, I do love them- they go up high enough to the actual mid thigh not just above the knee.",82113,4
82113,They're not as thick or stretchy as the American apparel ones but not bad for the price!,82113,4
82113,Haven't had the chance to wear them aside from trying on so maybe they will stretch a bit when I do!,82113,4
82114,Looks great on me.,82114,4
82114,It's decently made it looks like it will last.,82114,4
82114,"But it's definitely for the start of the evening, it fails at containment once the engine gets revving.",82114,4
82115,I love it but my little one is chubby she just turned one I ordered 18 months it was tight around her legs ...and the buttons pop off,82115,4
82116,"My husband wanted some ""Walter Sobchak"" from The Big Lebowski style aviators for a Halloween costume.",82116,4
82116,Got these and they worked well.,82116,4
82116,It helped complete the outfit and everyone knew who he was.,82116,4
82117,"It does run a bit small, be prepared, still a great product for the price.",82117,4
82118,The chain was broken when it arrived,82118,4
82119,Cool earrings..didn't really glow though.,82119,4
82121,Really cool but be obviously aware it's a little fragile,82121,4
82122,"My 18 month daughter wore these for several hours a day, over a week while we were at the beach.",82122,4
82122,They were perfect for her to walk around the pool deck without slipping and through the sand.,82122,4
82122,The shoes held up great!,82122,4
82122,She did get tiny red marks on her feet but that is assumed to happen with wet material after a period of time.,82122,4
82122,They weren't blistered and didn't seem to bother her at all.,82122,4
82122,She was excited for us to put her shoes on everyday to head for the beach/pool.,82122,4
82122,They dried within a few hours if they were in the sun.,82122,4
82122,I was worried about sizing and ordered a size 4 and 5.,82122,4
82122,She is a 4.5 a according to stride right and the 4's were perfect and will fit her all summer.,82122,4
82126,"Love my bag, but I didn't check the measurements first so I use it as a purse.",82126,4
82127,"But after only a few times worn, they started to great on the top part.",82127,4
82127,I still wear them though.,82127,4
82127,They look adorable under boots and they actually are really warm!,82127,4
82128,"Very good quality, but not sure if the adhesive tape is strong enough to hold....",82128,4
82128,Expensive shipping and though comes with normal post with no protection.,82128,4
82130,"Is not an official shirt, but this is my favorite album, and shirts of it are no where to be found except for this one.",82130,4
82131,Love the frames of the Reaction line sunglasses..Slighthly smaller than my 1st pair but still like em.,82131,4
82133,thought it would be larger,82133,4
82134,I do like this purse.,82134,4
82134,It's great for carrying just a few items.,82134,4
82134,The strap is very thin and I'm afraid it will break though.,82134,4
82135,Product runs slightly small.,82135,4
82135,This is my second purchase of this bra because i have oversupply and need a bra that can loosen as I engorge.,82135,4
82135,I also use it for pumping,82135,4
82137,"PROS:
The glasses came in pretty quickly.",82137,4
82137,The size fits well for me.,82137,4
82137,"The material and lens are as described, metal and polarized.",82137,4
82137,"CONS:
The glasses were missing a padding on the nose rest.",82137,4
82137,The left one was missing.,82137,4
82137,It kind of doesn't hold on to my head straight and slightly bends a bit on the missing side.,82137,4
82137,"However, it's not noticeable unless you take a closer look.",82137,4
82137,I'm guessing someone accidentally forgot to check it out before shipping or something/someone took it out on accident/purpose.,82137,4
82137,The pads are really stuck on the nose rests.,82137,4
82137,I don't think they could have fallen off on the way.,82137,4
82137,"CONCLUSION:
Great sunglasses from zeroUV for the price.",82137,4
82137,Will buy again in the future as a replacement for more expensive brands like Maui Jim or Ray Bans.,82137,4
82137,I recommend any sunglass from zeroUV to anyone despite missing that small part.,82137,4
82137,"It's a minor thing, but I think it wouldn't be bad next time.",82137,4
82139,loved the top but arms are extremely small.,82139,4
82140,Very nice and soft for my mom's head....,82140,4
82141,Only used it once but it worked as intended.,82141,4
82141,"That said, we didn't have any ""accidents"" to really test this diaper.",82141,4
82142,Tank for my nearly 3 year old daughter perfectly.,82142,4
82142,Shorts were too big and headband was a little snug.,82142,4
82142,My daughter is average size for her age.,82142,4
82143,Nice quality and the material lays well,82143,4
82144,I found this to be a high quality and sturdy product.,82144,4
82144,I don't understand the other reviews about their stretchers falling apart.,82144,4
82144,The reason I give this 4-stars instead of 5 is because the sizing seems a little small.,82144,4
82144,I bought the men's large for shoes 9-12.,82144,4
82144,I wear a size 11.5 and needed to stretch a pair that was snug in the toes (length was OK).,82144,4
82144,This stretcher is just long enough for my 11.5 length shoes with all of the adjustment maxed out - I don't think it is long enough for a size 12.,82144,4
82144,I would prefer to have a little more margin of error for the length and would consider a sizing for 10-13 or 11-13 offered by another seller if I knew this.,82144,4
82144,It will work for what I need but clearly borderline size.,82144,4
82144,Otherwise I am satisfied with the product.,82144,4
82145,Feels like a costume hat.,82145,4
82145,When I wear my natural hair or a wig with this I can feel the hat slowly come of my head.,82145,4
82145,I do have a slightly bigger head than normal.,82145,4
82145,Just can't wear it for long....but I still wear it.,82145,4
82145,"***UPDATE***
Communicated with the seller and they worked very hard to resolve the issue I had with the product.",82145,4
82145,They were very helpful and for that I added an extra star to this review.,82145,4
82145,I will not delete my review because I feel it is important to be honest and important if this is the type of product you are looking for.... And this is an honest review.,82145,4
82146,Great price and love the color!,82146,4
82147,"Well made, heavy and bigger inside than expected.",82147,4
82147,"I had to return it after picking it up and having it snag on the packing material, the table cloth and my shirt.",82147,4
82148,"Good quality, fit as advertised using the size chart and packaging was good.",82148,4
82149,these r sexy the only prob.,82149,4
82149,my husband says is watch the snaps!,82149,4
82150,"Nice but not for me so thin, and stone is small too.",82150,4
82150,Sparkle like real diamond .,82150,4
82150,"Will be looking very nice if your finger long, thin, Size 5-6",82150,4
82151,I received my trainer really fast!,82151,4
82151,The condition was great it was everything I expected!,82151,4
82151,I'm usually an xl in everything so I ordered the xxl to be safe but it was still a little tight even on the last set of hooks.,82151,4
82151,(This waist trainer came with 3 sets of hooks) other then that I was really satisfied would definitely recommend to a friend but as far as sizing ugh idk what to suggest.,82151,4
82152,Nice shirt but the lenth of the sleeves were too long,82152,4
82153,Tighter and smaller then what I expected,82153,4
82154,Necklace is very thin.,82154,4
82154,But i still love it.,82154,4
82154,It was purchased as a temporary chain for a charm but i like it enough to keep wearing it after i get my other one.,82154,4
82156,"Very good product, Saids my wife",82156,4
82157,Purchased these for my daughter who is 12 with a size 10 women's foot.,82157,4
82157,She loves the designs and comfort.,82157,4
82157,She said they were just a little too tight.,82157,4
82157,Could be after washing.,82157,4
82158,Could use a few more pockets/dividers.,82158,4
82158,Also strap could be more comfortable.,82158,4
82158,Perfect size for a carry on bag.,82158,4
82158,And I like that it has one exterior pocket.,82158,4
82159,Beautiful blouse that generates compliments every time I wear it.,82159,4
82159,"4 stars because the material does not breathe, but otherwise is great.",82159,4
82159,I ordered a Small and fit is like an XS.,82159,4
82159,I normally wear an XS so it is perfect for me - but definitely order a size up.,82159,4
82159,"I wash it on the delicate cycle and hang to dry, no problems with wear & tear, it is well made.",82159,4
82160,My Daughter is petite and she is turning 3.,82160,4
82160,I bought size 2 which Im glas but i still have to take the skirt in.,82160,4
82161,It was somewhat large.,82161,4
82161,"I guess I expected it to be form fitting, and I am a small person who usually orders a small, but but even the XS was a bit big.",82161,4
82161,"I like the style though, and the removable hood is nice.",82161,4
82161,"I'm keeping it, but I recommend getting at least one size smaller when you order.",82161,4
82162,I expected better fabric quality,82162,4
82163,It's really nice but awfully big.,82163,4
82163,"Since it's a nonadjustable bangle, it should be offered in a couple of different sizes.",82163,4
82165,I wear large but ordered a size up to be sure.,82165,4
82165,It fit perfectly though a large probably would fit too as I didn't have to stretch much to fit.,82165,4
82165,The material is thicker than I expect and very nice.,82165,4
82166,I would give it 5 stars if it came like it looks now!,82166,4
82166,I cut the tassel and thinned it by unloosing it a couple of times!,82166,4
82166,Otherwise the tassel is way oversized for he size of the purse!,82166,4
82167,"Smaller than I expected it to be, but still cute.",82167,4
82168,what a Christmas gift.,82168,4
82168,My mom is going to be pleased.,82168,4
82169,Is not the typical fit achieved from earlier renditions of this shirt.,82169,4
82170,I got this for my cleaning woman who is short but quite overweight.,82170,4
82170,"Closing it took a lot of energy, but was doable and she was generally pleased.",82170,4
82170,Her complaint was the garment was too short.,82170,4
82171,"I wouldn't be able to fit in it if it had sleeves, but other than that, I like it.",82171,4
82174,"I love this, it is a bit on the shear side fyi.",82174,4
82175,Material felt a bit cheap but still looked cute,82175,4
82176,Too cute of an idea to accentuate a baby's tiny delicate feet.,82176,4
82176,It is a bit snug however.,82176,4
82176,My daughter just turned 6mos.,82176,4
82176,She is not skinny but not that chubby either.,82176,4
82176,I also wish it came in more colors.,82176,4
82177,The shirt fit a little big.,82177,4
82177,"I like my tshirts to be loose, but this was almost too much to the point where it makes me not want to wear it as much.",82177,4
82177,Still an amazing shirt and I don't regret buying at all.,82177,4
82177,Funny little allusion to one of my favorite tv shows out there.,82177,4
82178,"Fit well, makes me look great",82178,4
82179,It was kind of thick and can be uncomfortable but if you stretch it out enough it feels and looks fine.,82179,4
82180,I wish it had some bling on it.,82180,4
82180,My only concern is that it comes in a tiny package so it comes extremely creased.,82180,4
82181,Nice and warm for inside use.,82181,4
82181,"like soft soled moccasins with little rubber ""feet"".",82181,4
82181,"No real left or right though, for those who concern themselves with such.",82181,4
82182,Was a little small,82182,4
82183,It is very elegant.,82183,4
82183,But I wanna know is it real Swarovski?,82183,4
82184,Love this bag awesome color and it big enough for all my stuff I need throughout my work week!!,82184,4
82184,Initially I thought the bag would be too small but it is perfect.,82184,4
82184,My  Vera Bradley tech organizer fits perfectly along with my other stuff!,82184,4
82184,Only issue I have with this bag is the zipper occasionally splits.,82184,4
82185,Somewhat large and bulky.,82185,4
82185,"Wanted support hose, somehow received regular crew sox however decided to keep them for boot sox.",82185,4
82185,High quality material and workmanship.,82185,4
82186,"The ""pouch"" took some getting used to.",82186,4
82186,"I definitely wouldn't recommend for anyone who has grown accustomed to only unzipping their fly, as the ""pouch"" has no outlet.",82186,4
82186,I feel like the overall quality wasn't great for such an expensive pair of underwear.,82186,4
82186,"It didn't hold up as well as my bulk package of Fruit of the Loom or Hanes underwear, which I can honestly say that I prefer.",82186,4
82186,"But, I can see why some guys would like these and I would strongly advocate for giving them a shot.",82186,4
82187,Dress up or down!,82187,4
82189,"very nice dress, the collar is a little small for my head.",82189,4
82191,"Super cute, but classy earrings.",82191,4
82191,Not too big and not too small.,82191,4
82192,"I am 5' 8"" and the length was a little too long but other than that I love it.",82192,4
82193,The hat is very cute.,82193,4
82193,I got a lot of compliments on it and it was very sturdy and convenient when i had bad hair days lol.,82193,4
82193,It wasn't expected to be anything fancy but it was what i expected.,82193,4
82193,Worth what i paid for it.,82193,4
82193,Its worth the buy.,82193,4

82195,"Alright quality, This review is being written a year and a half of using the product, Which only recently was thrown away.",82195,4
82195,Lasted a year and a half of rough use!,82195,4
82196,I am excited to use this product for future travel.,82196,4
82196,The pocket in the scarf is large enough to hold a passport and and tickets.,82196,4
82196,"However, when I tried to carry my phone in the pocket it was too heavy and pulled the scarf down and it was not as functional.",82196,4
82196,"It makes sense to use this for smaller, lighter documents and cash.",82196,4
82196,I would not call this a purse.,82196,4
82196,Ladies carry way more in a purse than you could practical carry in this scarf.,82196,4
82197,"Simple, comfortable, functional, & easy to replace without having a lot invested.",82197,4
82197,Would buy these again!,82197,4
82198,"Super cute hat, but very tough to get the creases out due to the way it was packaged.",82198,4
82198,I've ordered other hats like this before and didn't have issues so they should reconsider how they package this one.,82198,4
82200,Love the color and material.,82200,4
82200,Happy with my purchase!,82200,4
82201,"Nice skirt, but makes some noise when I move and it really bunches at the waist line.",82201,4
82201,Hard to find something that goes with it.,82201,4
82202,Nice bracelet for the price.,82202,4
82202,My 11 year old niece loved it.,82202,4
82203,Beautiful gift for that special little gal.,82203,4
82205,This hat is adorable and the perfect gift if you have a Yoshi lover like myself!,82205,4
82205,I only gave it a 4/5 because it didn't arrive in time for our Christmas in Lake Tahoe (shipped from the U.K. - allow a month +).,82205,4
82205,Thankfully it's roomy enough that he should be able to wear it for years to come.,82205,4
82206,I bought twelve of these bracelets to give to my yoga graduation classmates.,82206,4
82206,I have one with the larger beads which I like better so I gave this four stars.,82206,4
82206,It is a great buy for the money and looks great on.,82206,4
82206,I would recommend this but for myself prefer the one which is a bit more expensive from Amor.,82206,4
82207,Jean jackets are always a mandatory article of clothing one should have.,82207,4
82207,"I recently moved yet I realized my own was still in storage 5 states away, so I ordered this one and it was puurfect!!",82207,4
82207,"Cute, lightweight, and nice denim quality.",82207,4
82208,Comfy but runs a little large.,82208,4
82208,I will try to shrink in the wash!,82208,4
82209,Good little watch for what it is.,82209,4
82209,"However, it's cheaper to buy a new watch than to replace the battery.",82209,4
82210,I used this inexpensive crossbody bag at Disney for our 4-day trip.,82210,4
82210,It held up well and served it purpose.,82210,4
82210,"I can't imagine it would hold up to everyday use for long periods of time, but if you switch your purses out or just need it for a trip, it should do the trick.",82210,4
82211,"I little large in the cup area, but not noticeable.",82211,4
82212,"Its VERY tight and hurts at times on top, but I gather it is suppose to in order to work well!",82212,4
82213,"Shirt was just what was described,and fits perfect,great product for the price",82213,4
82216,I love the item i did get a small the first time  that the top was too small and the bottom was just a little small so i got a large and the top was still to small and the bottom was just right the funny thing is i am a 38 D and that is what the large said it would fit me but it did not I did not want to go any bigger because then the bottom would not fit so i just went out to target and got just a top that would match the bottom.,82216,4
82217,Very awesome slip but I do wish it were slightly longer,82217,4
82218,I started showing early and needed SOMETHING to help keep my pre-pregnancy jeans as part of my wardrobe until I got big enough to justify maternity clothes.,82218,4
82218,I wore my Ingrid & Isabel band almost everyday between months 2-3 and swore by it.,82218,4
82218,"HOWEVER, I started to run into issues as I got bigger and needed to wear the band unfolded.",82218,4
82218,"While it would be snug around my hips and lower belly, it'd be loose at the top of my stomach and would be awkwardly visible (in terms of bulgy fabric) under my tops.",82218,4
82218,"By month 5, I was too big for pre-pregnancy jeans and had to make the switch to maternity clothes.",82218,4
82218,"The band did what I needed it to do though, and I look forward to wearing this again post-baby.",82218,4
82218,I'd definitely recommend for moms trying to get the most out of their existing wardrobe (while it still fits)!,82218,4
82219,my neice loved them,82219,4
82220,they're vans need i say more,82220,4
82222,Love that stays up does not fold..it runs a Lil small so I would order one size up.,82222,4
82223,This gem clip is sorta big for my nose.,82223,4
82223,"However,  it is super cute and has a shine to it.",82223,4
82223,Doesn't look fake at all.,82223,4
82224,The shirt is almost perfect.,82224,4
82224,"It fits great, arrived fast and is in great condition.",82224,4
82224,"It fits me perfectly, I don't know what people are talking about.",82224,4
82224,It's very soft and the alien is stitched into the fabric not printed on.,82224,4
82224,Whenever I wear this shirt I always get compliments.,82224,4
82224,"However; after washing the shirt the alien became a little crinkled, take an iron to it and it's good as new",82224,4
82226,I thought it was cute and was appropriate for the price paid.,82226,4
82228,"I love this bag but the picture made me think the studs where gold, but it still pretty I get lots of compliments on it!",82228,4
82229,Nice colors easy to drape.,82229,4
82230,"super cute, can feel heavy/scratchy on a really hot day.",82230,4
82230,"If you live in a mild climate, it's a great suit",82230,4
82231,Fit pretty good didn't look what I thought it would look like on though,82231,4
82232,Haven't tried them on yet but they appear to be the right size,82232,4
82233,Bought this as a gift for a friend and she loves her little bag.,82233,4
82233,I expected it to be a bit bigger though.,82233,4
82234,I love iHeartRaves clothing.,82234,4
82234,I have many pieces.,82234,4
82234,"I picked this top with hopes to take it to Burning Man, which I still plan to so.",82234,4
82234,The top itself is very pretty and better made than some other iHeartRaves products.,82234,4
82234,However I am not a fan of how this the bra padding is.,82234,4
82234,"I typically wear a size small and sometimes extra small, but i feel this product is a bit tight on it's fit, this could be because I have been working out a bit more, but I don't think I have had that much gains.",82234,4
82235,"Cute, but the padded cups made the bra feel to small.",82235,4
82235,I even ordered a large.,82235,4
82235,I'm a 36 C,82235,4
82236,"Neck strap could have been a little longer but it wasn't an issue and the cups were kind of conelike but overall, I really like this bathing suitt",82236,4
82237,"Comfortable, washes well and did not shrink.",82237,4
82238,Bought this for my daughter who is a big Dr. Who fan for Xmas.,82238,4
82238,"It fits like I hoped it would and has not faded, ripped or separated to date.",82238,4
82238,"She likes them, they're pretty comfy.",82238,4
82238,Would buy pants like this again.,82238,4
82239,I ordered for a 2 year old and these would fit a 6year old,82239,4
82240,"Just didn't have the zipper in the back, other than that, it's a cute jumper..",82240,4
82241,nice bargain for the price.,82241,4
82241,"I bought it for RA and it fits right in ..buttons are brass and a bit jangly, but I can either get used to them or swap them out.",82241,4
82242,I love the fit!,82242,4
82242,looks very cute on!,82242,4
82243,The bottoms fit weird if you're not shaped like the woman in the picture which not many people are but the top is super cute and for that price I decided to keep them,82243,4
82244,I got the lg/x lg cause it says runs small and they are still tight.,82244,4
82244,Not sure what to do now.,82244,4
82244,Love the look and all but tight,82244,4
82245,Very cute size just right but after I washed couple time it's shrinked,82245,4
82246,A really good product.,82246,4
82246,"I was looking for something just a little bit bigger to handle additional ""stuff"" when I'm traveling.",82246,4
82246,"I like the hanging hook, this is an excellent feature.",82246,4
82246,The side pockets help a lot.,82246,4
82247,Absolutely love this swim suit was so sad it was to small but I sent back and reordered with no hassle a larger size.,82247,4
82247,I'm just waiting for it to come in the mail.,82247,4
82247,Great material and quality for the price just as pictured.,82247,4
82247,"Super cute and unique, very cheeky but I like to show off my booty so that's ok with me!",82247,4
82247,I recommend this swim suit to anyone also is a good suit to hide tummy fat and still look sexy.,82247,4
82248,It's beautiful like the pic.,82248,4
82248,...a few loose strands of fabric but nothing major to complain about except they don't put the sizes on the tag and dress runs small.,82248,4
82249,"Comfortable, love the colors, fits well.",82249,4
82249,Only time will tell how it lasts.,82249,4
82249,I've enjoyed wearing it so far.,82249,4
82250,Overall I was happy with this costume.,82250,4
82250,I do not agree with other reviews that the armbands are too small.,82250,4
82250,"They felt fine to me, and Iam average sized.",82250,4
82250,My only real complaint is that the top is kind of short so it rides up as you wear it.,82250,4
82250,I just wore a tank top underneath and it was no big deal.,82250,4
82250,I will agree that the neck gets a little itchy.,82250,4
82250,But you really can't go wrong for the price.,82250,4
82251,"Fashionable dress
I LOVE IT
The material is different than the picture
It is good quality and everything, it is just different than the picture
It is much lighter and needs to be ironed alot",82251,4
82252,I like these pants a lot.,82252,4
82252,They fit perfectly and are comfortable.,82252,4
82252,The pockets are a little weird.,82252,4
82252,They are very baggy and can look strange if your hands aren't in them.,82252,4
82252,Overall a great buy.,82252,4
82253,"I'm 5'3,  160 lbs and 36 DDD size 10..",82253,4
82253,I used size chart and got XXL given that these usually run really small.,82253,4
82253,I probably could have gotten away with an XL but I had no spillage from my top.,82253,4
82253,"This is a tie halter, not shoulder straps.",82253,4
82253,And no clasps in the bavk,82253,4
82254,"Bought for my granddaughter
Very well made and could be dressy or casual",82254,4
82255,"Good product for what I paid for, only downside is the long shoulder strap broke but that might be because of all the stuff in it.",82255,4
82256,"Found them a bit ""darker"" than what I am used to - but good for very bright days.",82256,4
82257,I bought it as a gift for my sister.,82257,4
82257,Its a beautiful color.,82257,4
82258,Very nice glasses but they do not help my stigmatism,82258,4

82260,Had to sew that cut up a bit but other than that LOVE.,82260,4
82260,I ordered the black/peach one,82260,4
82262,Pretty cool necklace will go good with my Steampuck outfit,82262,4
82263,"A bit small and hard to get on, but cute once you do.",82263,4
82264,They're a bit on the big side but I can't complain.,82264,4
82264,I have small hands so...but otherwise they're not too bad.,82264,4
82265,the pants don't stay up like I would like and do not hug you tight like workout pants generally do.,82265,4
82266,I wasn't crazy about the chain .,82266,4
82266,The picture mad it look more clear / see through,82266,4
82267,Looks just like the colors of the Ty Beanie pink owl.,82267,4
82267,My daughter giggled with delight.,82267,4
82267,"The bottom of the slipper is thin, but still worth the purchase for me.",82267,4
82268,It is a great size and the dragonflies really stand out after polishing every month after daily wear.,82268,4
82268,The background is dark like picture shows.,82268,4
82268,Looks great with contrasting charms.,82268,4
82269,These are not sturdy sunglasses.,82269,4
82269,If you're not the kind of person who takes very delicate care of things you will crush them pretty quickly.,82269,4
82269,They look stylish though!,82269,4
82270,"I am usually a small or in some cases a medium,  so i ordered an xl.",82270,4
82270,"When i first saw it thought it was too big, but it fit perfectly.",82270,4
82271,"Really cute, looking forward to the summer.",82271,4
82272,"Text was somewhat uneven and the fit was a little small, but it's what Murica needs right now.",82272,4
82273,It's just a tad snug but works.,82273,4
82273,Do I look like Johnny Depp or what?,82273,4
82275,"Great quality fabric for sure, however these do run a little small in the thigh area.",82275,4
82277,"I am 5'7"", 240 lbs 40DDD-36-47.",82277,4
82277,I ordered an X-Large (black) and it hugs all of my curves the right way.,82277,4
82277,"However, if you have big breasts like myself, some fashion tape or pasties will do you right with this dress.",82277,4
82277,"Overall, I am a happy customer!",82277,4
82278,"this boot stretcher is a classy piece or work--well made, precise, with the little bunion busters you can shape the boot to your perfect fit--the instructions tell you to use some leather stretching spray--the only surprise--i didn't need the spray, but if you are a perfectionist, get some",82278,4
82279,"Good quality, fits well.",82279,4
82280,I like the design and practicality.,82280,4
82280,The date is small,82280,4
82281,So I got this belt along with the Imperial pants and jacket parts of the suit and overall I like it.,82281,4
82281,"It is a little clanky, but not by much.",82281,4
82282,Great price for what you get.,82282,4
82282,"I bought these knowing they weren't going to be actual slouchy beanies, which I like.",82282,4
82282,They have a little room at the top but it definitely doesn't slouch.,82282,4
82282,Keeps your head very warm though.,82282,4
82283,I've been looking for a cute pair of high tops.,82283,4
82285,When I ordered these I was expecting a more thigh high like in the picture but these were a tad small and didn't ride up so high?,82285,4
82285,I kind of had to pull them up and they were suffocating my legs..,82285,4
82285,I'm a small in everything so I was very surprised and disappointed about that:(  Other than that good quality for the price and I love the design!,82285,4
82286,I'm soooo disappointed as the leather is butter soft and well made,82286,4
82287,"Lost a button early on, But has worn well",82287,4
82288,Very nice looking ring.,82288,4
82288,Took one star away cause the ring runs a lil large.,82288,4
82288,I take a size 12 but 12 for this ring is bigger than other size 12 rings i have.,82288,4
82288,This ring would fit nicely a half size smaller.,82288,4
82288,Might attempt to return for smaller size.,82288,4
82288,Outside that it's a very attractive ring.,82288,4
82289,This cardigan draped nicely over my wide shoulders.,82289,4
82290,It's looks gorgeous in my girlfriend body,82290,4
82291,The shoulders fit a little weird on me.,82291,4
82291,but overall very nice.,82291,4
82292,Fits better than expected.,82292,4
82292,I'm a size 12 after having a baby 4 months ago and it fit great and helped my stomach muscles tighten up after cesarean.,82292,4
82293,Thus suit fits me well.,82293,4
82293,"The pads in the bra feel funny, they are hard as rocks.",82293,4
82293,And have a crease right in the middle.,82293,4
82293,The two strap/designs over the breast kept just going where ever it wanted which was frustrating.,82293,4
82293,But overall the suit is nice,82293,4
82294,"I really love this dreso BUT unfortunately I have a  bit of cellulite and let me warnow girls like me, it shows EVERY SINGLE DIMPLE or pantyou line!!",82294,4
82294,There's no escaping it!,82294,4
82294,Also I'm 5'2 150 with 36dd so I got a large it for great with exception to the shoulder straps.,82294,4
82294,They're a little too big amd couldn't be adjusted so maybe I souls have gotten a medium.,82294,4
82294,Length was perfect just with it didn't show every flaw I have,82294,4
82295,I like the colors of it a lot.,82295,4
82295,I'm over 40 (eh hem!),82295,4
82295,and my arms aren't as firm as they used to be.,82295,4
82295,"So in the arms, this fits a little too close for my comfort and is not loose like I imagined.",82295,4
82295,"The rest of it is nice, and hits past the hips which is nice (camouflage!).",82295,4
82295,"I would probably order again, but maybe one size up, especially since it's intended for layering.",82295,4
82296,I'll never run out of tongue rings!,82296,4
82297,"Fits a little big, but I only got it to show off my back tattoo",82297,4
82298,"very see through, but fits properly.",82298,4
82300,"After reading the reviews that these run small, I purchased size 4T for my 2.5 year-old daughter who is wearing size 3T clothing.",82300,4
82300,These fit her perfectly.,82300,4
82300,"Snug, but not too tight.",82300,4
82301,These are super comfy.,82301,4
82301,The sizing is a bit wonky though (for my body type at least).,82301,4
82301,"The waist was really large, to the point of slipping down - but the legs were very tight!",82301,4
82301,I personally felt self conscious trying to pass them off as jeans.,82301,4
82301,"The mister said, ""I don't think I've ever seen jeans quite that... uh.... form fitting"".",82301,4
82301,I might not be able to wear these on all occasions - but I will say these make my ass look FANTASTIC.,82301,4
82302,"I loved the top, but it was incredibly large on me.",82302,4
82302,"I got a large so the sleeves wouldn't be tight on me, but the rest of it was huge.",82302,4
82302,I ended up giving it to my sister.,82302,4
82303,arrives in timely manner so happy to have my rayban again.... thank you,82303,4
82305,I had to purchase the dress twice.,82305,4

82305,"I stand 5'9"" weighing 185.",82305,4
82305,I have a small waist and usually expect altering my dresses.,82305,4
82305,"The 10 came and was huge, however the 8 fits amazing and I only had to take a small portion of the dress in.",82305,4
82305,Very flattering for hour glass shaped women,82305,4
82306,I give 4 stars for the prompt and immidiate response...this seller was so nice and sweet and great about getting me out the right size.,82306,4
82306,No hassel no back and forth,82306,4
82307,Shirt fit great but shorts were way to big so I just had to take in the waist a little bit wasn't too bad though,82307,4
82309,It fits a tad large.,82309,4
82309,I have not washed it yet so that could make a difference.,82309,4
82310,The oiutfit itself is fine.,82310,4
82310,I had in error received the wrong size.,82310,4
82310,I am currently working it out with the vendor to receive a larger size.,82310,4
82310,I will caution that European sizes are different from UK and US sizes.,82310,4
82310,"If you normally take a medium, it may be best to consider a large or x- large as they do run somewhat small....",82310,4
82311,I love this skirt.,82311,4
82311,It's very soft and cute.,82311,4
82311,However it's a little big.,82311,4
82311,I'm only 4'10 and a small is pretty big.,82311,4
82311,It's a good thing you can tighten it though.,82311,4
82312,This is a nice suit.,82312,4
82312,"I just wish the straps were adjustable, so I could make them a bit shorter.",82312,4
82313,Fabric is pretty opaque.,82313,4
82313,"The material stretches but the stiching doesn't stretch, so the fit is a bit odd.",82313,4
82313,I think if I loose ten pounds I may be able to wear them so I'm keeping them.,82313,4
82313,"I bought an XL, I'm 5'8"" and wear a 16/18.",82313,4
82314,My daughter loves these boots but they were a little too big for her even though I bought her actual size.,82314,4
82314,Otherwise they are absolutely adorable.,82314,4
82316,Would be 5 stars but material isn't as good as I would have liked.,82316,4
82316,"My daughter on the other hand would give it a million stars, and really that's what matters.",82316,4
82317,Great but pricey and bendy and clipy,82317,4
82318,I love the artwork but the socks are tight on my size 10 feet.,82318,4
82319,The first time I put this on I had a very hard time opening it but after the first couple times it screws on easily,82319,4
82320,Really cute but size up.,82320,4
82320,Bust was far too small for me.,82320,4
82320,"I am 5'4"", 135 lbs and my bust is 36""",82320,4
82321,"Ordered one size up, still a little small",82321,4
82322,"Was beautiful, now make
Sure to air dry so it doesn't shrink.",82322,4
82322,"More like a medium or large, so if looking for a bigger size I wouldn't recommend",82322,4
82323,I thought it would be a thicker material it's more of a t shirt weight.,82323,4
82323,"I like it but wish it were more ""cozy""",82323,4
82325,Is good product.. for every day occasion.,82325,4
82327,"Very cute for the price, but it ran kind of small, I'm 5'5 155 and I'll usual wear a medium,  but I ordered large, but I was send an XL and that was still a bit snug on my behind,  and I don't have a very big one Lol, but its cute I made it work.",82327,4
82328,This blazer is perfect for warmer weather.,82328,4
82328,The lace weave allowed great circulation without locking in the heat like traditional blazers.,82328,4
82328,The lace is extremely striking and I get compliments every time I wear it!,82328,4
82328,"My only complaint is that because the lace is sort of embroidery-like, the tears can snag on things easily and have a large, fuzzy pilling effect.",82328,4
82328,Snip the fuzz off with a pair of scissors and it's good as new though.,82328,4
82328,I wear this to work but you could easily pair it with a dress or skirt and wear to a wedding or am evening out.,82328,4
82328,Definitely worth the price!,82328,4
82329,Very cute nursing bra.,82329,4
82329,Band could be firmer.,82329,4
82330,These panties are black with a sewn in white liner on the backside.,82330,4
82330,However the liner is paper thin.,82330,4
82330,There is very little difference between these and regular panties.,82330,4
82330,I am very skeptical as to how well they will hold up during a period.,82330,4
82330,I will update my review when I see how well they perform under pressure.,82330,4
82330,"**updated review**
After using these panties for a few months I am happy to update my review and say they exceeded my previous expectations.",82330,4
82330,"My child has had no leaks or break-through bleeding issues, even over-night.",82330,4
82330,These are to be worn in conjunction with sanitary napkins.,82330,4
82330,The one down-side is the size.,82330,4
82330,"I bought the largest size for my eleven year old (she is a tall girl), and they are almost too small.",82330,4
82330,The size in not comparable to USA girls panties sizing.,82330,4
82331,"I am 5'4"" and 145 lbs.",82331,4
82331,"I ordered a size LARGE, but will be ordering it again in XL.",82331,4

82331,"The color is bright, and the print are identical to the picture.",82331,4
82331,The quality is comparable to any expensive swimwear.,82331,4
82332,Love the size and feel of this watch.,82332,4
82333,Like the quality and it fitted just right.,82333,4
82334,"This fez runs large, so if you have smaller head it will slide down on your head.",82334,4
82334,"Great doctor who cosplay item, though :)",82334,4
82335,The top is a lot shorter than expected.,82335,4
82335,I'm a 34b so it fits okay but I do not recommend it for women with larger breast.,82335,4
82335,Also the skirt is bigger than expected.,82335,4
82335,"My waist is 26"" and my hips are 35"" luckly I have extra velcro to tighten the skirt myself.",82335,4
82335,"My boyfriend loves it, I'm planning to wear it to the next rave I go to or maybe for Halloween.",82335,4

82338,Didn't come with the right amount of beads.,82338,4
82339,Beautiful but way too large!!,82339,4
82339,My 5 year old wears a solid 13 but this fits like a 1.5 on her.,82339,4
82339,"I will have to exchange for a whole size smaller than she usually wears, a 12.",82339,4
82340,"The colors are bright, and the design is attractive.",82340,4
82340,"I love the kimono style on babies, and it's nice not having to pull clothing over their heads.",82340,4
82340,"It runs a tad bit small, and I wish they came on larger sizes!",82340,4
82341,Bought these for an '80s costume.,82341,4
82341,"So far, they look nice and feel comfortable.",82341,4
82341,"I followed other reviewers' recommendations and went a half size up, and I found it to be completely unnecessary.",82341,4
82341,"I'm typically a 7.5, bought these in an 8, and they're big on me.",82341,4
82341,Keeping the ones I ordered because I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning.,82341,4
82342,"good price, fits at expected.",82342,4
82344,Good quality and sturdy which is a huge plus.,82344,4
82344,A bit heavy on your ear lobes if you are using long cuff earring for the first time.,82344,4
82344,Doesn't stain...so far but lets see how that last but overall it's cute.,82344,4
82345,Great little necklace for the cost!,82345,4

82347,The ring was very nice looking and seemed quite durable.,82347,4
82347,I did not like how you could barely see the inscription describing the ring on the inside.,82347,4
82349,Good quality dress at excellent price.,82349,4
82349,"I'm 5'4"" and length is perfect if I wear heals, otherwise it's too long.",82349,4
82350,"It fit great, the only issue I had was the lining in the bottom of the skirt was coming out, so it lost the ""frilly"" effect.",82350,4
82351,It fits well and does the job.,82351,4
82351,"Styling is not beautiful or ""sexy,"" but it is as pictured, well made, and looks fine under clothing..",82351,4
82352,"Different color than most of my earrings, so they are unique to me.",82352,4
82352,"I enjoy the size and the weight isn't an issue...although if you're not used to dangly earrings, you won't be used to these.",82352,4
82352,"In my opinion, the earrings match up exactly with the size/weight categories that would be expected for earrings that dangle and are metal.",82352,4

82358,very reveling but then again that is the idea I tried them on for my lady friend and she loved them made her very excited ....As for me there was just barley enough room for the boys to stay contained but once I got erect that was the end of that it pulled them tight and the boys and the boys were free to hang so I guess the pouch could have been a bit bigger but then again they didn't stay on very long anyways all in all im glad I purchased them,82358,4

82360,"I'm not the type to baby my laundry, so they are washed in warm water and tumble dried on normal setting, and so far holding up well.",82360,4
82360,The only thing I don't like is they do seem to attract lint quite a bit.,82360,4
82360,"The length was all the way to my ankle despite being a ""capri"" and I'm 5' 7"", but after a few washing/dryings the length is mid calf, where I like them to be.",82360,4

82362,"Only downside is the mothball smell, needs airing out.",82362,4
82363,"The only issue I had was that it came horribly wrinkled and I had a hard time getting the wrinkles out, other than that it was cute.",82363,4
82364,Great product for an affordable price.,82364,4
82364,"Although,  some stitching came loose when I added cards I into different parts of the wallet.",82364,4
82364,I probably overfilled the wallet.,82364,4
82365,"I like it because it's cotton, and it fits true to size.",82365,4
82365,"However, it being cotton, it turns to fade after a while when washed with certain detergents.",82365,4
82365,I have about 6 of this brand.,82365,4
82366,This set of charms works very well with my wife's Pandora bracelet.,82366,4
82366,It showed up on time and in good shape packaging was a little cheap but relay who cares about that.,82366,4
82366,My wife loves it and the only reason i gave 4 stars and not 5 is the charms do not fit together like they should not a big deal since they will never hang touching but ...all in all good price good product as some of the charms i find don't fit the actual Pandora bracelets.,82366,4
82367,It is a lot of fabric for this dress.,82367,4
82367,"Drape fairly well, but makes me look a bit plump.",82367,4
82368,The dress is pretty but probably a foot too long!,82368,4
82368,"I'm 5'4"" n but still.",82368,4
82368,"I gave it to my daughter since she is taller (5' 7"") than me & won't have to get as much cut off the bottom & hemmed.",82368,4
82369,This item I love the style of it and I was thinking about returning it but I think I will try to get some alterations done on it.,82369,4
82369,The only thing that needs to be fixed is  that it is waaay too long.,82369,4
82369,"No matter what kind of heels I wear and I am 5' 4"".",82369,4
82370,Sleeve length is too small.,82370,4
82371,"it was to small for my kid , i will get some thing else from you, sorry!",82371,4
82372,"The chain is sturdier than it looks, but it's still feminine and delicate.",82372,4
82373,It is excellent items just don't fit well a little small,82373,4
82374,"I love the design, it looked exactly as I expected but I ordered a size larger than I thought he would need and it was to small.",82374,4
82374,Hope it encourages him to lose a few pounds.,82374,4
82374,He kept it anyway.,82374,4
82376,Loved the top for perfect.,82376,4
82376,The bottoms are a little snug.,82376,4
82377,Really appreciated just being able to find a lab coat in sizes and style appropriate to a young child.,82377,4
82377,I was delighted that my nine-year-old grandson asked for a science experiment kit for Christmas and the lab coat was a perfect additional accessory.,82377,4
82378,These bras came in vibrant colors and I was super excited about them but I had to return them because the largest size was too small for my large ladies (40ddd).,82378,4
82378,If only they were just one size bigger they would have been perfect!,82378,4
82380,The flowers are actually bigger than pictured.,82380,4
82380,"I thought it would be a little daintier, but it's still cute and pretty nonetheless.",82380,4
82380,Very hippy looking which is a look I like to pull off often.,82380,4
82380,Great to for spring and summer!,82380,4
82381,"I stand about 4'10, weigh approximately 105 lbs., and bust size is a D cup.",82381,4
82381,"The crop top fit me as expected with a ""medium"" size.",82381,4
82381,It wasn't too tight and stretched quite comfortably.,82381,4
82381,"However, maybe it was because of my cup size, the crop top did not look as fitted as it does in the picture listed; there was a bit of a gap between the top and my midriff.",82381,4
82381,"Other than that, I really do like this crop top!",82381,4
82381,I even got complimented quite a lot when I wore it during an anime convention.,82381,4
82382,I bought this jacket for my son for Christmas and he loves it!,82382,4
82382,It is super reflective which is what he was looking for.,82382,4
82382,It also had a very comfortable fit.,82382,4
82382,I would recommend buying 2 sizes larger than you normally wear.,82382,4
82383,Very nice colors and comfortable.,82383,4
82383,Bought this in a different color and the exact same size and the other one didn't fit.,82383,4
82383,it was too large.,82383,4
82383,This one fit much better.,82383,4
82383,I don't know why they fit differently.,82383,4
82384,great pattern and shine,82384,4
82385,I got the medium.,82385,4
82385,"I have 32DDD breasts, I am 5'6"", weight 115.",82385,4
82385,Medium fit me perfectly.,82385,4
82385,Only issue is you need to be very careful when tying it because the strings are quite thin.,82385,4
82385,Seems like they could rip easily.,82385,4
82386,Super cute but very cheap material,82386,4
82387,Looks super cute with a peacoat!!!,82387,4
82387,Thought the inside would be bigger.,82387,4
82388,"Perfect, casual dress for the summer.",82388,4
82388,I love the pockets!,82388,4
82388,Is a couple inches above the knee but I feel comfortable bending over and not exposing anything!,82388,4
82388,"Overall, great fun little dress!",82388,4
82390,Little too big for my neck but that's bearable.,82390,4
82391,Had to air it out because it had a strong smell of petrol.,82391,4
82392,Looks a lot more expensive than it is.,82392,4
82392,Fits true to the size chart.,82392,4
82394,JUST A LITTLE BIG MIGHT FIT BETTER IF I ORDERED A XS.,82394,4
82394,MORE OF A NAVY COLOR AND MATERIAL IS A LITTLE TOO SHEER.,82394,4
82394,I DO LIKE IT.,82394,4
82394,BUT WISH IT WAS A LITTLE MORE FIRM FITTING.,82394,4
82395,the one thing that surprised me was the fact that the charm face is coverd with clear enamel.,82395,4
82395,This is the first that I have seen this on.,82395,4
82396,It's nice just runs small,82396,4
82397,It is a bit heavier than I expected on my finger.,82397,4
82398,It is comfy and it fits but I expected it to be a bit loser's still cute though,82398,4
82399,"I ordered a medium, i'm 5'3, 36 DD, 140 lbs.",82399,4
82399,It is tight on the chest but obviously I am larger on top!,82399,4
82399,It doesn't fit me like the model(LALA!),82399,4
82399,it hits me right under the boob.,82399,4
82399,I have to wear flip flops with it because it is too short with wedges.,82399,4
82399,"It is super cute and great for a concert, festival, or casual night out!",82399,4
82400,Looks exactly as pictured and fits true to size.,82400,4
82400,If you are big chested there is no support whatsoever.,82400,4
82400,"Even so, it's still very cute,  and seems to be well made.",82400,4
82402,Wish it were a little bit longer but overall a good quality shirt especially for the price,82402,4
82403,looks great and fits my girls pandora charm,82403,4
82404,The shirt is darling and made well.,82404,4
82404,The skirt is cute but kind of see thru.,82404,4
82404,You can just put bloomers on though.,82404,4
82404,My only feedback is that every shirt says big sister avery.,82404,4
82404,I thought this was an example when I ordered it so I can't wear it.,82404,4
82404,They should just make the outfit with no name and it would be perfect and a great price.,82404,4
82405,I'm normally a B/C depending on my size around.,82405,4
82405,But because this is backless I went with the C. I wore it twice on vacation and loved it!,82405,4
82405,It was hard to get used to the feeling of not having any straps holding you in.,82405,4
82405,But once you get passed that it's fine.,82405,4
82405,Ended up returning it though because I feel like a D would be more comfortable for me (I need a little more room on the sides).,82405,4
82405,Hoping I feel a little more comfortable in the D!,82405,4
82406,nice fit nice colors,82406,4
82407,My son loves them,82407,4
82408,Cute dress and a nice price.,82408,4
82408,I see myself wearing these a lot this summer.,82408,4
82408,I bought pink and red.,82408,4
82409,I got the red but it is more like a red-orange.,82409,4
82409,"Other than that, it great",82409,4
82410,Like the top & it fits now perfect.,82410,4
82410,Unsure what washing will do as the material is a  little thin.,82410,4
82411,This is pretty much as described.,82411,4
82411,"They color is spot on, the size is as expected, and is actually well made (i.e.",82411,4
82411,"no weak seams, rips, thick fabric, etc.)",82411,4
82411,My only problem is that it is shorter than I'd prefer but not excessively so.,82411,4
82411,I got the dark blue and it is not see-through at all - just saying because I read some reviews about this as a problem.,82411,4
82411,"Before worrying about the sizes, just know that this is very stretchy material!",82411,4
82411,As long as you pick the closest size to your regular (going by American sizes not Asian) size then there should be no problems.,82411,4
82411,"Also, there is actually plenty of room in the chest area so it is not very low cut or small for larger sized women.",82411,4
82412,"For daughter, she loves them!",82412,4
82414,good karate and kick boxing shoes.,82414,4
82414,good grip on mats,82414,4
82416,Very Nice material and long enough to make different styles!,82416,4
82416,I'll be using it in this winter for sure!,82416,4
82417,"I love this shirt; the fabric is awesome, I can tell it will hold up well.",82417,4
82417,"Lots of color choices, I already ordered another!",82417,4
82417,It is perfect for workouts or just comfortable around-the-house weekend/casual wear.,82417,4
82417,"I would, however, recommend ordering a size up.",82417,4
82417,"I normally wear a size 18/XL, sometimes a 1X.",82417,4
82417,Based on the size chart I ordered a 2X and it fits me like an XL OR 1X.,82417,4
82418,"cool little jacket, keeps dry",82418,4
82419,This isn't what I wanted but it's very nice and seems well made.,82419,4
82419,I'm trying to ditch the purse and I thought I'd be able to carry this in my jeans pocket.,82419,4
82419,It's too big for that.,82419,4
82419,Shouldn't have bought it without getting the dimensions.,82419,4
82420,I ordered 2 sizes up and it fit perfectly.,82420,4
82420,I am usually a med/large so I went with a x large.,82420,4
82420,Cute and a nice material.,82420,4
82421,Great gift for Christmas,82421,4
82422,Purchased this for my wife and she loves it.,82422,4
82423,"The wallet is great and I love it, small but I expected small.",82423,4
82423,I'm a little concerned about the topstitching but so far so good.,82423,4
82423,The reason for only four stars is because of the delivery.,82423,4
82423,Usually I get a survey request for that but since I haven't here's the information.,82423,4
82423,"It was delivered on time, however it wasn't delivered to my house it was delivered to my neighbors.",82423,4
82423,Had they not been home who knows how long it would've been before I got it.,82423,4
82423,"It wasn't one of the normal delivery companies, and my address was correct.",82423,4
82424,It's beautifully made but the legs are a little small if it's plus size most women have full legs,82424,4
82425,"Nice dress, stretchy material.",82425,4
82425,Seams are weak and threads pop easily.,82425,4
82425,"Makes for a nice ""dress up"" outfit not regular use.",82425,4
82425,It worked perfect for our Christmas dress.,82425,4
82426,"Other than the sizing, really warm and fuzzy",82426,4
82427,"they're a little big for me, not overly so, and veeery warm.",82427,4
82427,glad they got here before the weather went to below zero,82427,4
82428,They were a little tight - but showed up quickly and looked great!,82428,4
82429,Liked it so much I bought a second,82429,4
82430,"My bf loves, but wishes he would have ordered 1/2 size smaller",82430,4

82431,I fancy myself as an audiophile.,82431,4
82431,I have a large 45rpm collection.,82431,4
82431,I thought this stabilizer/weight would be just what I was looking for.,82431,4
82431,"I have issues with warped records, more so with vinyl records.",82431,4
82431,This seems to be a much less problem withs styrene.,82431,4
82431,"I would like to elliminate as much of the ""warp wobble"" as possible when playing a record.",82431,4
82431,The sabilizier does a very nice job of this.,82431,4
82431,"Even records with larger warps, it can still help eliminate much of it.",82431,4
82431,I have posted a video of a 45 with a slight/medium warp.,82431,4
82431,"The stabilizer also helps with records that are bowed in the center, where the center is much higher than the outer edge of the record.",82431,4
82431,This causes an angle/slant to the record that would effect play.,82431,4
82431,"Once you place the stabilizer on the record, it would flatten the record, or as near to flat as it can get.",82431,4
82431,"Even if the record was bowed the other way, it would still flatten the outer edge of the record even if it was only slight.",82431,4
82431,I really like the stabilizer and it does a great job.,82431,4
82431,"I thought by the description it would not be heavy enough but now that I have it I can tell you it is plenty heavy enough to do the job is was designed for,  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I thought it was kinda pricey.",82431,4
82431,"But, I would recommend this to anyway.",82431,4
82432,"I'm not crazy about light-up shoes, as they tend to look cheesy and bulky.",82432,4
82432,"But kids love them, so I feel these were a good compromise.",82432,4
82432,"They look decent, are easy to put on (no laces), seems comfortable, and have multiple lighting options (on/off, interganging colors, solid color, blinking color).",82432,4
82432,The choices are endless; fully customizable to fit style/personality/day.,82432,4
82432,Each shoe can be controlled on its own!,82432,4
82432,These shoes have quite a bright light that remains on (unlike most light-up shoes that only light while stepping) until turned off.,82432,4
82432,"The mini USB charge port is located in a discrete pocket on the inside part of the shoe, within the strap.",82432,4
82432,I've seen similar shoes here on Amazon with a huge black velcro pocket that didn't look esthetically  appealing.,82432,4
82432,I've included pics from right out the box!,82432,4
82432,I ordered with Prime and received in 2 days!,82432,4
82432,So no shipping from China and having to wait 4 weeks.,82432,4
82432,"As for price, at $36 I would say is quite fair.",82432,4
82432,Cheap Walmart/Payless shoes run at least $25 easy.,82432,4
82432,My son is soon to be 5 and wears shoe size US11.5/12.,82432,4
82432,"I ordered the US12 in Navy, and they fit perfectly right out of the box.",82432,4
82432,"I usually prefer to buys shoes a 1/2 size bigger for more wiggle room and room to grow, but since these shoes don't have laces to tighten, larger is not quite ideal.",82432,4
82432,"My son loves them, so I was glad to please his desire for light-up shoes.",82432,4
82432,I've even seen similar style shoes for adults so even the bigger kids can still have light-up shoes.,82432,4
82432,Let's see how the hold up.,82432,4
82432,Will update as necessary.,82432,4
82432,"But for now, I would give a thumbs up for sure.",82432,4
82433,"Nicely designed product, but a little too big to keep in my jeans pocket.",82433,4
82434,"im glad a got a size up from what I normally would have, it does come small but its very nice!",82434,4
82435,"Fits but is a little baggy, overall happy with it.",82435,4
82435,Just as described and pictured (:,82435,4
82436,"Very nice, also warm.",82436,4
82437,This shirt is great for work; cute but office friendly.,82437,4
82437,Runs a little large.,82437,4
82437,I'm a size 10/12 or a M/L and the large fits but is a little roomy.,82437,4
82437,"The shipping was very quick, though!",82437,4
82437,The material feels a little cheap but it will be great for summer.,82437,4
82439,The costume fit well...I am 5'7 145 and got a medium.,82439,4
82439,"It is kind of hard to get on by yourself because the zipper in the back, I had to have help.",82439,4
82439,So keep this in mind.,82439,4
82439,It was decently made as far as costumes go.,82439,4
82439,The helmet is pretty much unwearable if you ask me though.,82439,4
82439,"It fits very close to your face and is hard to breathe in, but I didn't plan on really wearing it much anyway, so that was ok.",82439,4
82439,"It looks good on, and I got lots of compliments.",82439,4
82439,It is sexy without being trashy like so many women's costumes these days.,82439,4
82440,There are a bit thinner than I expected but I don't know much about thickness of gauges and all that jazz but overall very good gauges black blue white and red are the best of the bunch I would definitely buy again,82440,4
82441,"The sunglasses fit my face a little strangely, but after nosepiece adjustments, they felt much more comfortable.",82441,4
82441,Cute style and they arrived exactly as described.,82441,4
82442,It's s little tight.,82442,4
82442,I'll work my way into it.,82442,4
82443,This product really flattens my belly.,82443,4
82443,It was very difficult to hook it on.,82443,4
82443,"However, I had left about three open and I guess the more I use it the more it would be easier to hook it.",82443,4
82443,I have read up on waist training .,82443,4
82443,You really have to continue to use in order for it to stretch more.,82443,4
82443,I use it one day and I can tell my posture is very different.,82443,4
82443,I walk more upright and I see more definition in the core area even though my waist instead smaller yet.,82443,4
82443,I may wear this when wearing some of my dresses that I haven't worn in a while.,82443,4
82444,This is suuuuuuper adorable!,82444,4
82444,It fits my daughter good but I expected it to be a little looser on her for her to grow into.,82444,4
82444,My daughter wears 4t but the tops and pants are a little long and the waist has room to grow into.,82444,4
82444,So I thought getting s 4t it would be just a tad looser than what it is.,82444,4
82445,I got both and she looks adorable in them.,82445,4
82445,The snaps aren't the sturdiest but as quick as she grows she won't be in them long anyway.,82445,4
82446,"It seemed like a nice swim suit, but I had to return it since it is not designed for top heavy women.",82446,4
82449,"Fit pretty well when I ordered one size up since it's stretchy, but it's a little short.",82449,4
82449,Super comfy and breathable.,82449,4
82449,A great dress for keeping the dark look on hotter days.,82449,4
82450,I like this suit but it runs way too small.,82450,4
82450,I normally wear a size 14.,82450,4
82450,I got the largest size they offer and it just doesn't fit  like I had hoped.,82450,4
82450,Good material though and I love the design on it.,82450,4
82450,Will be returning for a refund.,82450,4
82450,The seller is really  great and will work with you on returns or exchanges!,82450,4
82451,"I would have like it a little bigger, but my SO loved it.",82451,4
82452,These run a bit big but they look awesome!,82452,4
82452,I would have given 5 stars but the inside of the boots is a bit uncomfortable for my 5yr old to wear without tall socks and the bottoms are SLICK!,82452,4
82452,He fell several times on the hard floor because of the slickness of the sole.,82452,4
82452,"I think it'll be OK after we scuff them up but for the price, I would have thought they would have been a bit better.",82452,4
82453,I have to return because it is too snug on me,82453,4
82455,"It really cute, a bit tight but good!!",82455,4
82456,Earrings seem to be pretty legit.,82456,4
82457,this should work quite well on cruise for accessory.,82457,4
82458,A little on the cheap side but very sparkly and beautiful!,82458,4
82460,"Well padded so your items don't break, lots of compartments and a wall hook.",82460,4
82460,I wish it was an inch or two wider but all in all I love it.,82460,4
82461,I really like this for the price!,82461,4
82461,I intended to wear it as a dress but it works better as a swimsuit cover-up.,82461,4
82461,It cuts pretty low in the armpit area.,82461,4
82461,I ordered a small (usually wear a small) and it's fits fine.,82461,4
82462,"Nice bag, but I haven't even had it for a month and the bag is tearing apart...literally..",82462,4
82463,This bra is beautiful but...the cup sizing is fine but the bra needed extenders to fit the size it advertised.,82463,4
82463,It runs really small around the torso.,82463,4
82463,It is very pretty so I'll just buy the extenders so I can wear it.,82463,4
82464,See through on the boob area,82464,4
82465,same as in the pic.,82465,4
82466,A little small / tight but very cute.,82466,4
82466,"It's made of a ""swimsuit-like"" material.",82466,4
82466,"Colors were bright, but a bit off -olor.",82466,4
82466,The part that should be turquoise is light blue.,82466,4
82466,"I know this is a knock-off product and so I was prepared for the slight variations, but overall it's a very cute skater dress!",82466,4
82467,The skirt is pretty and very warm.,82467,4
82467,It's better to order one size up.,82467,4
82467,The seller is quick to respond email enquiry and is very helpful.,82467,4
82468,Wife liked it good quality,82468,4
82470,I got lots of compliments when I wore this for the first time to a birthday lunch on Saturday.,82470,4
82470,"Flowy, comfy, breezy...so pretty and easy to wear.",82470,4
82471,I put clear Polish on them so they won't turn my fingers green.,82471,4
82473,I wear a size 8 normally and the Large was too small.,82473,4
82473,I ended up keeping it and gave it to a friend who loved it.,82473,4
82474,I bit see through - I had to wear a tank under.,82474,4
82476,"This took some time putting on and when I
I did get it on it was very uncomfortable having a,piece of thin fabric uo my behind if you're used to wearing thongs you won't have any problems wearing this I did however see a difference in the shape of butt from the side and the back see attached photos didn't do much for slimming my stomach area either",82476,4
82477,Beautiful tie for a great price.,82477,4
82477,My only complaint is that they did not place the fabric so you can see a full flower on the front of the tie.,82477,4
82478,I would recommend to get one size bigger than normal.,82478,4
82479,Super cute and worth every penny!,82479,4
82479,Purchased for Santacon/ Birthday celebration.,82479,4
82479,The fit was great and received many compliments.,82479,4
82479,More of a Jacket than a dress.,82479,4
82479,I am 5'11 so fit my arms a little short.,82479,4
82480,it is a nice shirt..i just wish it was longer to cover my behind..thought thats what it was going to be like..,82480,4
82481,Great fabric and stitching.,82481,4
82481,Seems shorter than in the picture.,82481,4
82481,Has more of a shirt-like fit than a kimono or coverup.,82481,4
82481,But still a really pretty piece.,82481,4
82482,"They fit really well and get the job done, but the cotton is super thin.",82482,4
82482,You get what you pay for though.,82482,4
82482,"I definitely like them enough that I would order them again, once these give out...because I wear them all the time.",82482,4
82483,I love the bathing suit just fit a little more snug on my daughter than I'd like.,82483,4
82484,"Cute, roomy weekend bag at a great price!",82484,4
82485,Got these as a gift for some and she loved them!,82485,4
82486,Really cute but too small.,82486,4
82486,I have ordered a couple of things from Asia and they have been too small.,82486,4
82486,Mature women order 1-2 sizes larger.,82486,4
82488,"I've had it on for four days,  looks great.",82488,4
82488,Let's see how it holds up.,82488,4
82489,Nice fit and decent quality,82489,4
82490,Excellent deal on quality product,82490,4
82491,"Just got it today, and it's smaller (the dome part of the necklace is 1.7 in diameter) than expected but it's nice xP",82491,4
82492,Fabric is flowy so the drape is great.,82492,4
82492,"It's very obviously not the greatest quality, but you can't tell unless you look up close.",82492,4
82493,Looks great a little small,82493,4
82494,Great product for the price!,82494,4
82497,They are warm and comfee material and cover my ears for those cold nights.,82497,4
82497,Colors where just as appeared.,82497,4
82498,It's a good shoe,82498,4
82499,I think she likes it but it's a bit of a chore to put on.,82499,4
82499,That's probably to be expected.,82499,4
82500,"A little big, but still love this shirt!",82500,4
82501,The dress is full skirted enough that it still looks vintage without the full slip beneath... the only negative us that the little bow-tie was sewn too far to one side as its supposed to hide the top center button...But because the button IS there there's really no way to center the bowtie....,82501,4
82501,I took it off and the dress is actually a little more comfortable and still looks great!,82501,4
82501,I love a nice shirtwaist dress (emphasizes the bodice - makes waist appear smaller and hides a plump bottom)!,82501,4
82501,Fun dress alot of compliments!,82501,4
82502,"As is sometimes the case, Chinese product sizing is a bit problematical.",82502,4
82502,I wear 33 or 34 waist and ordered these in tag XL.,82502,4
82502,"Of the six pair, four fit quite well but two are undersized slightly in the leg opening resulting in a less than deisrable fit.",82502,4
82502,"I may order again and get the XXL, however this is more a quality control issue that anything else I believe.",82502,4
82502,The ones that are proper fit give you an awesome lift and really make your package very prominent and are quite comfortable.,82502,4
82502,A good value even considering the fit issue.,82502,4
82502,"So, a followup review here based on the results of my second order, in XL again.",82502,4
82502,In both orders two of the six pair are seriously undersized.,82502,4
82502,Interestingly it was the red and yellow pair in both orders.,82502,4
82502,"Not only are they undersized, while the fabric has the same texture as the other colors, it is not the same.",82502,4
82502,The fabric in the red and yellow has significantly less stretch and give than the other colors which makes the under-sizing issue even more of a problem.,82502,4
82502,But again the ones that are sized correctly are great.,82502,4
82503,Good shorts for the price.,82503,4
82504,Nice blouse I ordered 2 sizes up after reading reviews and looking at the size chart but I think 1 size up would have been sufficient.,82504,4
82505,I received the bag todayit is very good quality.,82505,4
82505,But only one default that I didn't receive the wrist  belt of bag.,82505,4
82505,So I give you four stars.,82505,4
82506,but not so small that I can't still wear it.,82506,4
82506,I suggest you buy 2 sizes up.,82506,4
82506,The material is very thin and see through so they are great for hot summer days.,82506,4
82506,they hang just low enough that they make what ever you have on look nice.,82506,4
82506,"I usually wear a Medium, I  am 5'2"" 133 lbs.",82506,4
82506,I think you get your moneys worth.,82506,4
82507,The quality is awesome for the cheap price,82507,4
82509,Really tucks in the right places.,82509,4
82511,Nice fabric but too boxy and large.,82511,4
82511,The medium was too wide.,82511,4
82513,"Not quite what I was expecting, but still like them.",82513,4
82514,The bottom of the but cut outs  kinda hurt but I really like this girdle.,82514,4
82514,It doesn't roll down and I can wear my own bra,82514,4
82515,nice but runs a bit small,82515,4
82516,"It looks great and its pretty comfortable, but the fabric isn't what I expected.",82516,4
82516,"It's also gets a bit hot, but it's still a great hoodie.",82516,4
82517,Super cute on but I followed the size chart and sized up and I think I sized up to much.,82517,4
82517,It's a little big so I'm thinking of exchanging it because I'm currently dieting.,82517,4
82517,"But besides that it's super cute on, and the top I like because it gives you a little push up as well...",82517,4
82518,"I was interested in this dress for a wedding (bridesmaid), and while the length and waist fit nicely, the bust was too large for me.",82518,4
82518,"Because of the style of the bust area, it would have been pretty difficult to have it altered (and probably expensive, too), so I ended up returning it.",82518,4
82518,"The size chart included a range of measurements, so it was difficult to tell if it would fit (my measurements fell on the smaller end/middle).",82518,4
82518,"According to the tag on the dress, the XS is equivalent to a US size 4; had I known that, I would've known it would be too big!",82518,4
82518,"A nice dress, but it might not work if you have a 32A/34A or smaller bra size.",82518,4
82520,Kinda small around the diaper area.,82520,4
82520,Had to order another size because of it,82520,4
82521,He's so cute in this!,82521,4
82521,"The slippers are hard for a kid to keep on, though.",82521,4
82521,Just foam blocks with a shallow toe box.,82521,4
82522,It is cute but I was hoping for more a tourqouise like the picture but it is more baby blue.,82522,4
82522,"Unfortunately the white fringe didn't look good me maybe because I am 5'3"" but it would be great for someone else!",82522,4
82523,These sweaters are really cute and a great bargain.,82523,4
82523,"They are not the best sweaters in the world, but for $7 + shipping they are fantastic!",82523,4
82523,"I got three - blue, purple, and coffee.",82523,4
82523,They are all as pictured and super comfy!,82523,4
82523,I can't wait for it to get cold outside so I can wear them!,82523,4
82525,Very similar/comparable to the extendable bladebuilders lightsaber toys.,82525,4
82525,"The actual ""light beam"" that extended is probably half as thick so more likely to bend but so far my son hasn't broken it.",82525,4
82525,Overall I'd say it's a decent prop.,82525,4
82526,"A little tight, but absolutely cute.",82526,4
82527,Arrived within just a few days of ordering.,82527,4
82527,I am a size 6-8.,82527,4
82527,"This will probaby worj for the one night I need it, but would probably be more comfortable in a large.",82527,4
82527,Especially since the sequence is a bit scratchy.,82527,4
82527,"It's also a little transparent, so plan to wear a solid layer underneath.",82527,4
82528,Im 5'8 160lbs with 38dd.,82528,4
82528,I got a medium and the top barely covers my boobs .,82528,4
82528,Definately wouldnt be able to wear a bra without it sticking out.,82528,4
82528,The skirt is perfect for me because its fitted but also stretchy enough to cover up the muffin top area and pull it in.,82528,4
82528,Skirt a tad bit log but you can fold it and make it shorter,82528,4
82529,One of the screw tunnels broke the first time I wore it.,82529,4
82529,"Other than that, all good.",82529,4
82530,Perfect i love it,82530,4
82531,"I consider myself a true 9.5 in shoes (my size in Keens, for instance).",82531,4
82531,The 9 was too small.,82531,4
82531,"Exchanged for a 10, which mostly fit, but was still tight across the top of foot, above the arch.",82531,4
82531,"So, I used a trick I'd learned when I accidentally let one of my previous Crocs get too hot in a car, and they shrank (don't let Crocs sit in a car or even in the sun on a hot day).",82531,4
82531,"Filled a basin with very hot water (tap plus a boiling kettle), and floated the shoes upside down in them to soften the foam.",82531,4
82531,"Then, put on two pairs of extra thick socks, and put on the warm/softened shoes to stretch them out a bit.",82531,4
82531,They fit much better now.,82531,4
82531,Like the improved grip sole on these (why I picked these).,82531,4
82531,The venting (none) is poor.,82531,4
82531,I will probably cut-out the not-vents in the side as other reviewers have suggested.,82531,4
82535,This was definitely over priced but I loved it!,82535,4
82535,Its very soft and cute.,82535,4
82535,"Although, it got wet and is no longer as soft.",82535,4
82538,My lovely lady loves these.,82538,4
82538,"Cute, easy to wear, stuff in your pocket or handbag when not needed.",82538,4
82539,The product itself is great.,82539,4
82539,My husband loved the fabric.,82539,4
82539,The size may be a little off.,82539,4
82539,I ordered the large which says it fits 36-38 and they were a little tight for my husband's liking.,82539,4
82542,It does run larger than the size I am used to.,82542,4
82542,"But it's fine, maybe this type of dress is suppose to be larger in the middle.",82542,4
82544,"It does not like being outdoor... After 2nd or 3rd wear, I got run... by 4th wear it went into the trash... for one pair...",82544,4
82546,"I really like this dress but I usually wear a medium or small in dresses but got a large because I wanted it a little room but it fit me regularly, which is fine but would recommend for you to get it a size larger then you usually wear.",82546,4
82547,"The 4"" description is incorrect the bows are 3"" and the bands are not all the same size.",82547,4
82547,The bows had some missing sequences on it that wasn't too noticeable.,82547,4
82547,Definitely very cute and Price was very reasonable for the quality,82547,4
82548,"As others have said, these do make things darker than normal sunglasses, but you can still easily see when looking through them.",82548,4
82548,"They are decent quality, but you can't expect perfection when you get a 3 pack for $6 (I purchased them 2 years ago and 2 of the 3 pairs are still going strong).",82548,4
82548,They are also fairly comfortable.,82548,4
82548,Can easily bend the frames without breaking if they get uneven.,82548,4
82551,"personally not the type for me, good backup glasses though.",82551,4
82551,Very comfy to wear.,82551,4
82553,"I normally wear an xl, but I got a large.",82553,4
82553,Even the large is too big on me.,82553,4
82553,But it's quickly becoming my favorite item in my wardrobe and I'll definitely be ordering more colors.,82553,4
82554,"So cute, can't wait to drop about 15-20 pounds to wear it!",82554,4
82555,Love the colors of the blue ones.,82555,4
82555,"I will say that unfortunately, the seat of the pants are see through, which is unfortunate!",82555,4
82555,"They would be fine for a run, but do not pass a squat test!",82555,4
82557,This is a sexy v-neck cut out shoulder top.,82557,4
82557,The material is silky and stretchy.,82557,4
82557,The sleeves are more like cuffs that hug around your arms.,82557,4
82557,The v-neck is adorned with a beautiful white applique that is not flimsy or cheap.,82557,4
82557,I would definitely advise handwashing this delicate piece to avoid damage to the applique.,82557,4
82557,The body of the top is not form fitting.,82557,4
82557,It is loose and a bit flared.,82557,4
82557,I would personally prefer a more figure flattering look but I guess this is the style for this top.,82557,4
82557,So go ahead and eat that extra piece of bread with butter at the dinner table.,82557,4
82557,I chose the red but it looks more like a deep blood red shade.,82557,4
82557,It is bold and beautiful just as the top is.,82557,4
82557,I would recommend ordering your true size.,82557,4
82557,My true size is medium and it fits me well.,82557,4
82558,Somewhat small in the bust.,82558,4
82559,Nice little purse for a great price.,82559,4
82562,It's comfortable and versatile,82562,4
82563,"They are fine, would prefer better waste band, maybe with a loop or draw string would be great to connect keys, or make tighter?",82563,4
82564,CUTE BUT LOOKS A LITTLE CHEAP,82564,4
82565,This was just the right amount of compression after a C-section.,82565,4
82565,I'm petite at 5'1 and 125 lbs when I put this on 4 days after my c-section.,82565,4
82565,I was still pretty tender and had to take it off after an hour.,82565,4
82565,I put it back on at 9 days after my c-section and it felt really good.,82565,4
82565,Any more pressure would have been really irritating.,82565,4
82565,I have a short torso and this fit pretty well.,82565,4
82565,"I didn't, but you could always just fold over the top if it was too long for you.",82565,4
82565,I was hoping that the size small would last a little longer.,82565,4
82565,"It didn't take long before I felt I needed more support, and bought an adjustable, more structured binder.",82565,4
82565,"I continued to use this one on days that I felt more tender, or when going out (as the adjustable binder was bulky under clothes).",82565,4
82565,I had dissolvable stitches and a type of liquid bandage over the incision.,82565,4
82565,The silicone patch on these made the liquid bandage feel kind of soft so I always wore this over a pair of panties to keep it off the liquid bandage.,82565,4
82565,Might be better for a different type of incision closure.,82565,4
82566,I read the reviews so I ordered up 2 sizes and it was still a bit snug but I do like the quality of the material.,82566,4
82566,I would recommend it for the price.,82566,4
82567,I bought these bras for my mother and she likes them.,82567,4
82567,No complaints so far :) .,82567,4
82567,She hinted at getting them and surprised her.,82567,4
82567,I may order a set for myself.,82567,4
82568,I love these headbands and have them in mutiple colors.,82568,4
82569,Great value for the style and material.,82569,4
82569,"The dress fits really well, sexy yet comfortable.",82569,4
82569,The top part wasn't done very precisely.,82569,4
82569,"You will need to spend some time readjust the laces, so it won't show the inner layer of the dress.",82569,4
82572,This is really comfy and the color is exactly what I expected.,82572,4
82572,The material is fairly thin but doesn't feel cheap.,82572,4
82572,"My only complaint is that the sleeves are more narrow than I expected, even though I ordered a size bigger than I usually wear.",82572,4
82572,Aside from the sleeves it fits great!,82572,4
82573,"A bit snug, but seem to be quality shirts",82573,4
82574,Nice glasses that go perfectly with a poodle skirt.,82574,4
82577,I got this hat as a gift and she loved it!,82577,4
82577,If got bent uo in the mail but it was easy to put back into shape.,82577,4
82577,This hat is good quality and very cute for the price.,82577,4
82578,These pants are a nice style.,82578,4
82579,Fit exactly as I wanted.,82579,4
82579,"My 17-year-old said they looked ""okay.""",82579,4
82579,I may need to get more styles/colors.,82579,4
82580,The top is the best!,82580,4
82580,Wore this with Wedge gym shoes!,82580,4
82581,"My son was literally flying as he wanted to be flown by his dad, as he called himself Superman.",82581,4
82581,This summer in the swimming he ll have the best of times ever.,82581,4
82583,This item can easily go as a swim suit cover or as a kimono I like it alike.,82583,4
82584,I am giving this suit 4 stars instead of 5 only because of the fit.,82584,4
82584,I really think I could have gone down a size but the reviews I read said the suit ran small so  whatever.,82584,4
82584,The top I adjusted the straps to make it fit better but I would have liked some adjustability in the band of the top as it seems loose for a swimsuit .,82584,4
82584,I guess that's my only complaint as the suit seems to be good quality and I love the color.,82584,4
82584,I'm a 36 DDD and the girls fit just fine.,82584,4
82584,The light blue is really more greenish teal.,82584,4
82585,"Daughter loves it, just have to have it taken in just a little bit",82585,4
82586,great quality and look for the price,82586,4
82587,These are good value for the price.,82587,4
82587,Light and soft fabric.,82587,4
82587,They run a little short so if your waist is 32 and your inseam is 30 then the medium is perfect.,82587,4
82588,"Arrived with some of the boning poking out, which was incredibly uncomfortable.",82588,4
82588,"I was able to fix it by sewing it closed, but still super annoying to have to fix an item right away.",82588,4
82588,"It's very stretchy, and nice to move around in.",82588,4
82588,"Doesn't smooth out everything the way that most corsets do, but the material is very soft and buttery.",82588,4
82588,Feels nice on the inside as well as the outside.,82588,4
82589,it's cheaply made but that's to be expected from most amazon clothes around this price range.,82589,4
82589,otherwise it's a cute outfit though!,82589,4
82590,Very lightweight and comfortable.,82590,4
82590,Perfect for Florida weather.,82590,4
82591,We ordered this in the 12-18-month size for a wedding for our son who had just turned one.,82591,4
82591,"It was an evening wedding and past his bedtime, so we specifically wanted something that we could just put him straight to bed in when we got back to the hotel.",82591,4
82591,It worked perfectly for what we wanted and looked quite cute.,82591,4
82591,It's as comfortable as any onsie outfit but manages to look like a suit.,82591,4
82591,"Our son is right at the 50th percentile mark for height and weight, and it just barely fit to snap up at the crotch, so I strongly recommend buying a size up for an averaged sized kid.",82591,4
82591,"When he had his 15-month growth spurt he no longer fit in it, and I have seen others mention the size is small.",82591,4
82591,"The pants didn't go to the ankle, but I'm not sure if that's a style thing or just a sizing issue.",82591,4
82591,"He still received many ""cute"" and ""adorable"" comments, so that isn't a big issue to me.",82591,4
82591,"If you do buy a larger size, you'll likely have to roll the sleeves a bit, as they were almost long.",82591,4
82591,The only real problem for us we had was keeping the bow in place.,82591,4
82591,"I'd recommend taking a needle and thread to it to quick-stitch it in place, as it slips out easily.",82591,4
82591,"It went through the washer and dryer a few times without problems or noticeable shrinking (he outgrew it pretty quickly, so we only washed it two or three times).",82591,4
82591,"We ordered it a month in advance, as the possible shipping time was fairly long when we bought it.",82591,4
82591,It came in plenty of time.,82591,4
82591,The price was better than most outfits for kids this age.,82591,4
82591,"In my opinion, absolutely!",82591,4
82591,Will a person wanting something that looks expensive like it?,82591,4
82591,"No, you don't get expensive-looking at this price unless something is on sale.",82591,4
82591,"Yes, but in a larger size and early enough that I don't have to sweat the delivery time.",82591,4
82591,"Overall, I was quite pleased with it and am glad I didn't spend mountains of money on a suit for a wedding.",82591,4
82592,this is a beautiful dress it runs large nothing a belt want fix,82592,4
82593,I maybe should've gotten a large.,82593,4
82593,I typically wear small.,82593,4
82593,I wanted more loose fitting / flowy.,82593,4
82593,But these are comfortable.,82593,4
82593,I got a medium (thought I sized up) and it's relatively fitted.,82593,4
82593,still comfortable and nice to wear to lounge / exercise / run errands.,82593,4
82594,They are a bit smaller than I expect to wear it don't fit my face right.,82594,4
82594,Like it's made for middle schoolers.,82594,4
82594,But they look very cool,82594,4
82595,The size runs larger than expected.,82595,4
82596,Realistic looking except for the fact they have 2 seams and the art doesn't line up.,82596,4
82596,"So at a glace, realistic looking.",82596,4
82596,Look a little closer and the seams are visible.,82596,4
82596,Otherwise I would have gave 5 stars.,82596,4
82596,Works well over my ugly compression sock!,82596,4
82597,I had wanted to get something for all those store/club cards you get from everywhere now a days.,82597,4
82597,They were just taking up to much room in my wallet and I could never find it while in line or my wallet was so full I couldn't close it anymore.,82597,4
82597,I decided on this one because first I love the color and the yellow is bright making it easy to find in even the deepest purse.,82597,4
82597,Another deciding factor was that it could hold 26 cards!,82597,4
82597,"I did discover while filling it that you CAN NOT put 2 cards in the same sleeve, if you do the case doesn't snap closed.",82597,4
82597,However since I was able to fit all the cards I needed to into the case I can live with that.,82597,4
82598,"button holes for hood had to be opened with a razor, but overall costume is very nice.",82598,4
82598,Came with extra buttons.,82598,4
82599,"It's pretty and lightweight, but does run a little small.",82599,4
82599,"I usually wear size 4-6, or small/medium, plus I'm only 5'3"" so I bought a medium.",82599,4
82599,It's short and a little tight.,82599,4
82600,"This top is very pretty, but runs very small.",82600,4
82600,Order 2-3 sizes larger than usual.,82600,4
82600,Washed once and air dried so far and didn't shrink too much.,82600,4
82600,"Shipping took several weeks, but that is what they told me it would be.",82600,4
82601,Material was nice...I think it runs somewhat large...did like the front opening but did not realize there was a larger opening in back...had to return & seller immediately responded...great customer service...and again for the price the material was very good...sad it didn't work for me...I'm 60 & in good shape but I I think it would work better for a younger person...,82601,4
82602,Wash in cold water to retain color and hang dry.,82602,4
82605,"Loved this bracelet, but I only wore it for a few months before the silver turned green and the cross actually broke!",82605,4
82605,"It's cheap, so I'm not too upset, but its definitely not meant to be worn all the time.",82605,4
82607,I have two pair of these slippers.,82607,4
82607,I like that they are soft and warm and easy to put on as I have knee and ankle damage from a car accident.,82607,4
82607,The only thing I don't care for is that they seem to run a little small and after a while my toes feel cramped in them.,82607,4
82607,"If I buy anymore, I will get them in a size larger.",82607,4
82608,"Nice bag, beautiful color.",82608,4
82608,The liner isn't the best but the rest of the purse is really nice.,82608,4
82608,I like the three different compartments and that the whole purse zips.,82608,4
82609,"material is different from the picture, it came in silk but the flower pattern is very pretty",82609,4
82610,Just received the set they are very  beautiful Can't  wait to wear them there are actually  Rhine stone's which I did not notice when purchasing its more beautiful  in person.,82610,4
82611,Let you know how that goes.,82611,4
82612,"We are big fans of crocs in our household, especially for the arch support and ease of putting on/off and cleaning.",82612,4
82612,I wish the kids crocs weren't so wide though.,82612,4
82612,The shoes are a bit loose in width and I'm afraid don't offer the support that I'm looking for.,82612,4
82612,"Even still, crocs are excellent to have around for the kids to slip on/off easily in the summertime and on the go.",82612,4
82613,Super cute and very reasonably priced!,82613,4
82614,This dress is a showstopper.,82614,4
82614,Perfect for my daughter's 6th birthday party!,82614,4
82614,I still don't understand the sizing and had to guess but it worked out.,82614,4
82614,Definitely recommend for the price!,82614,4
82615,Use it to hold my ID and some business cards,82615,4
82616,Super cute hat and a great fit for my average size head.,82616,4
82618,"Fits true to size, light weight and very comfortable.",82618,4
82618,"The shoes came already charged, so my son could wear them right out the box.",82618,4
82618,"Only issue is the USB cord in the shoe moves far down in the shoe, and it's hard to get to when I want to charge the shoes.",82618,4
82618,Still a great buy!,82618,4
82619,GREAT shorts but I got a medium and it still feels a bit small for me.... will order a large next time.,82619,4
82620,"I initially order one hat and loved it, so I ordered two more.",82620,4
82620,"However, the second two were much smaller and one of them barely fits.",82620,4
82620,Would be great if the sizing was consistent for all colors/hats.,82620,4
82622,"I really like the plating and the overall look, just a little smaller than I thought.",82622,4
82623,"Thought the leggings would look just like the Disney characters but they have glasses and mustaches, I guess for copyright purposes.",82623,4
82623,Other than that their great.,82623,4
82624,Buy your normal size.,82624,4
82624,True to size and very cute.,82624,4
82625,A bit big on me which makes a me look a lot bigger then I am being that it's not fitted.,82625,4
82625,"Other then that it is very comfortable, nice material.",82625,4
82626,Keeping in mind the low cost of entry this really is a nice watch.,82626,4
82626,Lots of details on the face and keeps time well so far.,82626,4
82626,I'd buy another one if I found a different color combo.,82626,4
82627,a little fragile but they all are ... comfy,82627,4
82628,"Cute and fun, and they feel very nice on.",82628,4
82628,"But, I guess my booty isn't big enough for them.",82628,4
82628,They were a little loose around the leg and ended up looking like boyshorts on me instead.,82628,4
82628,"Which is fine, except I thought they'd look more like the picture on me.",82628,4
82628,"They did fit everywhere else though, which is why I said they fit as they should.",82628,4
82628,I ordered the correct size.,82628,4
82628,Returned simply because I didn't need another pair of boyshorts.,82628,4
82628,Arrived in time and packaged really well so they wouldn't get crushed.,82628,4
82628,Returning was easy too.,82628,4
82628,"I didn't have my return email slip with me at the post office, but with one phone to Yandy.com, they gave me an RA number and off the panty went in the mailbox!",82628,4
82628,Awesome company to deal with!,82628,4
82629,"The pants run way too small and are see through, however when making the return the company was very nice and accommodating that's why I'm giving it a higher rating.",82629,4
82630,"Nice socks, the flip over design for the hand warmers works pretty good.",82630,4
82631,I used the measurements and it fit me well.,82631,4
82631,Gave it 4 starts because it is missing a button.,82631,4
82632,Great looking a Lil tight,82632,4
82633,Grandson loves theses shoes.,82633,4
82633,Strap broke but Crocs made good on it.,82633,4
82633,Crocs is a great company!,82633,4
82634,tney were too large or me but the fabric looks beautiful and as if it would wash and wear beautifully,82634,4
82635,Not well made but is very cute and my nephew was complimented all day on his cute little outfit.,82635,4
82636,Great colors and fit!,82636,4
82637,"I only gave these four stars because I can't wear them daily, due to minor nipple irritation.",82637,4
82637,"I was hoping to wear them everyday, but I have to take a break after a few days.",82637,4
82637,"They do the job, however, and they don't budge until you peel them off.",82637,4
82637,They are definitely sweat proof.,82637,4
82637,"Under very thin knits, like a ""liquid knit"", be sure to press down around the entire cover or you may see the outline.",82637,4
82638,"I'm a size medium, but I wanted it to be loose, so I got a large.",82638,4
82638,"It was nice, as I expected.",82638,4
82638,"The cardigan was sort of thin, which I need for the summer, and the color was the same as the picture.",82638,4
82638,What I didn't like was how short the sleeves were.,82638,4
82638,It ended above my wrist.,82638,4
82638,"The length of the cardigan was also alright (ended at my butt), yet I wanted it to be a little lower.",82638,4
82640,Great fit and warm!,82640,4
82640,But you have to string it yourself which was annoying.,82640,4
82640,Overall its a great color and fit.,82640,4
82640,I ordered a Large and my bust size is a 38DD,82640,4
82641,"Good quality, could use a thick chain as shown in the movie.",82641,4
82641,"But this one will do for now, does the job.",82641,4
82642,"Fit well, light weight.",82642,4
82643,"Cute bag, inside edges are khaki and white striped.",82643,4
82643,I thought it was black/white striped.,82643,4
82644,Came later than expected and the box is slightly damaged.,82644,4
82644,"I am thrilled with the size of the box, it will make transportation easier and I love how the pins are secured in place.",82644,4
82644,Each pin is surprisingly better quality than I expected.,82644,4
82644,"I recently bought the Black and Red badge sets for myself, although the red set is taking much longer to deliver, and plan on getting the rest later on for conventions.",82644,4
82645,I was thrilled to get this dress!,82645,4
82645,It fits like a glove & is so bright & playful.,82645,4
82645,"It is airy & delicate, a beautiful color & i will buy another dress soon!",82645,4
82646,Cute for a summer dress..,82646,4
82647,Wore for Cisco de mayo.,82647,4
82647,"Since it was shipped from China it took awhile and was a bit flattened, but I was able to fluff up the roses.",82647,4
82648,Nice and somewhat fashionable hat.,82648,4
82648,It will keep your head warm.,82648,4
82650,Good fit nice material little stretch but not a lot.,82650,4
82651,I bought the 3XL/4XL and was still a little small (I usually wear XL).,82651,4
82651,These are SUPER COMFY!!!,82651,4
82651,"Beware: first time wear, you will have black fuzzies EVERYWHERE from these pants.",82651,4
82651,One wash and they will be fine.,82651,4
82651,"My boyfriend loves the way they look on me, so I'm happy with them :)",82651,4
82652,The are the right color.,82652,4
82652,They were a little tight going over the feet but comfortable.,82652,4
82653,"Sheer, but Love the fun patterns and colors, fit pretty well.",82653,4
82654,Purchased to go with under my son's tuxedo for prom.,82654,4
82654,He looked so handsome!,82654,4
82657,I bought these to make them into a pair of tye die shoes.,82657,4
82657,The shoes and the shoe box came in unharmed.,82657,4
82657,When I tried on the shoes it turned out I couldn't really wear them with socks.,82657,4
82657,But since I plan to use these for the summer I saw no problem with that at all.,82657,4
82658,The only problem I'm having with it is the spacing.,82658,4
82658,I've tried to close it a little so that it actually stays on but it's either so tight that I can't get it on properly or the spacing is too wide that it kinda just falls out.,82658,4
82658,Other than that I love it!,82658,4
82658,It's looks just like the picture and definitely worth the price!,82658,4
82659,Love the dress and got excellent comments on it,82659,4
82660,"This is a great bag, with lots of room and several separate compartments that make good use of available space.",82660,4
82660,"The fabric is sturdy enough to withstand a light rain, and the padded pocket for a laptop is great.",82660,4
82660,"My minor complaints are: 1) the pad on the shoulder strap is not sewn into position but rather is just a loop that encircles the shoulder strap-- this means that the shoulder pad ""migrates"" quite a bit, and can cause the shoulder strap to slip easily.",82660,4
82660,2) the skimpy handle.,82660,4
82660,"Everything else is sturdy on this bag, but the carrying handle is a ribbon-thin piece that is located off the ""peak"" of the bag, so it leaves everything askew if you want to pick up the bag before slinging onto your shoulder.",82660,4
82660,A padded handle in a more balanced position would make it easier to pick up or position the bag.,82660,4
82660,"Finally, it's nice that the clasps are located underneath the flap for security reasons, but they do take some getting used to at first (you have to get used to digging up and under the flap, rather than with most packs being able to pop open the clasps easily).",82660,4
82661,It can be really difficult to see though.,82661,4
82661,So try not to run or do anything risky with this on.,82661,4
82662,Suit runs a little small.,82662,4
82662,"It is a nice coverup type of suit, but the top part of it gets a bit heavy in water.",82662,4
82663,I am usually a medium and I ordered a large.,82663,4
82663,I am 5'10 and 140 lbs.,82663,4
82663,"I was nervous that this would be too short, and while it is definitely short, the flowy bottom half helps the romper remain in place and appear longer.",82663,4
82663,"I ordered the brown, and while it looks like an olive color in the photo, it is definitely a light brown material instead.",82663,4
82663,"It does look a little cheap, but overall I'm happy with the purchase and am considering getting it in another color!",82663,4
82664,"I have been looking for a ""bull"" necklace for a while now, and as soon as I saw this necklace I had to have it.",82664,4
82664,"The bull is a good size, and the necklace is light weight.",82664,4
82664,"The material does not bother my skin (I have sensitive skin), and it is durable.",82664,4
82664,"I also liked the packaging, especially the little summary of what the necklace means.",82664,4
82664,"I wish I ordered the 18"" because I like my necklaces to be a little bit longer, but the 16"" still looks cute!",82664,4
82665,Make sure you look at the dimensions this is an above average sized toiletry bag,82665,4
82666,Great play shoes for my son.,82666,4
82667,"The belt is the right color, width but it was a bit too long for my taste.",82667,4
82667,"I cut off about 6 inches, which was easy to do and now it fits just fine.",82667,4
82668,"I had to return them bc they were damaged when I received them, but they fit great and looking forward to the new pair!",82668,4
82669,Nice and useful with the UV-protection.,82669,4
82670,"Sizes aren't uniform, but I guess that's expected with stone.",82670,4
82671,"Super soft,  very comfortable",82671,4
82672,When I opened the package I was appalled at how small these leggings were.,82672,4
82672,Then I was amazed to find when I tried them on that one size fits most was exactly correct!,82672,4
82672,Thanks for the great leggings at a great price.,82672,4
82673,"Super cute, but they did take a while to get here.",82673,4
82673,They keep feet warm and dry.,82673,4
82674,"Took two sizes up, fits perfectly (I am M, took an XL).",82674,4
82674,"Wore it three times, and it already has fluff on it.",82674,4
82674,Have to pull the sleeves down all the time.,82674,4
82675,This Product work very well and is kind to my skin...,82675,4
82676,My son wears a 5 comfortably but with these his toes r all the way at the end.,82676,4
82676,They r super cute and easy to wash.,82676,4
82677,"Just FYI on this top: the buttons are not functional, they are just decorative.",82677,4
82677,"They are also quite bright silver, which is not captured in any of the photographs of the product.",82677,4
82677,"I love it, it makes a classy little cardigan for temperamental Pacific Northwest days that swing between cool and warm.",82677,4
82677,I can wear it with a cami or a plain long sleeve shirt.,82677,4
82677,"I'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs, petite/athletic build, and the small fits like a glove.",82677,4
82678,"Good fanny, looks like the pic and sits flat and not bulky unless packed.",82678,4
82679,These aren't bad for the price.,82679,4
82679,I usually purchase Nike Elite for my son but thought I would check these out for him to wear just for Basketball practice and use the Nike Elite for the games.,82679,4
82679,Anyway these are not bad to beat around in .No where that I read in product description do these mention the word Nike Elite.,82679,4
82679,So of course I wasn't expecting that especially for this price.,82679,4
82679,If I wanted Nike Elite I know where to go.,82679,4
82679,That said yes Nike Elite are great quality but I'm not reviewing them .These are on the thin side but so far I haven't saw an issue with these sliding down as of yet anyway.,82679,4
82679,They seem to wash well without shrinking and maintain the color.,82679,4
82679,For the price I personally think they are pretty good and most likely purchase more for his Basketball Practices.,82679,4
82679,Seller was great shipping and delivery was fast and they arrived packaged perfect!,82679,4
82680,I was happy that they didn't have that awful chemical smell like the other shoes I ordered had.,82680,4
82681,I purchased this for my Pebble Time Steel.,82681,4
82681,"I had to adjust the band a little to attach to the watch, but it looks great.",82681,4
82681,Good purchase for the price,82681,4
82682,"It works well, especially for the first couple of days after surgery.",82682,4
82682,The only problem was that I should have gone with the bigger size.,82682,4
82682,"This pair made it a little difficult to breathe because they are designed to compress your abdomen and waist while recovering, but I was between sizes all the way through my pregnancy and the same has gone for post partum.",82682,4
82683,"I ordered a size large (5'2"" 130 lbs) and it is a litter too large.",82683,4
82683,I would order true-to-size.,82683,4
82683,"However, even though it is a little big, I love it.",82683,4
82683,"Shipping was very fast as well, even though this is not a Prime item.",82683,4
82685,The V sets a bit low.,82685,4
82685,Pairing this with leggings and flip flops or a nice pair of sandals and you have yourself a nice little summer outfit.,82685,4
82686,fit was ok for my daughter,82686,4
82687,These look like they will work - slightly smaller than expected but nice material and construction.,82687,4
82687,If they don't shrink in the wash they should be fine.,82687,4
82688,"Nice, light and stylish.",82688,4
82688,I pick them for the unusual style of frame.,82688,4
82688,Happy with my choice,82688,4
82690,Really warm and soft lovely for the fall,82690,4
82691,"Feel good in my dress shoes, no seams to make them hurt my feet",82691,4
82693,Super comfortable but on the expensive side.,82693,4
82694,Cute and just as pictured.,82694,4
82695,Cute but COMPLETELY see-through!,82695,4
82697,The material is very nice and comfortable.,82697,4
82697,Be sure to use the size chart if you want a perfect fit.,82697,4
82697,"The color on these are vibrant, very stylish.",82697,4
82697,The crotch area is made to fit comfortably as well.,82697,4
82698,Loved the dress and feel but it was a bit too small in the top,82698,4
82701,This is the helmet to buy if you want to be protected.,82701,4
82701,I like that it conforms to my head and is more and more comfortable the more I wear it.,82701,4
82701,It also has extra feature like earbud holes.,82701,4
82702,"Really cute and good quality but unfortunately a little too small for me :(
Sellers were great and very helpful",82702,4
82703,Love the shirt but the xlarge is more like a large,82703,4
82704,"These wool socks are well made and warm, however, they are rather small.",82704,4
82704,I wear a size 12 (US) shoe size and they are too small for me.,82704,4
82704,I gave them to a woman I know and they fit her fine.,82704,4
82704,"These are good quality wool socks, but if you have big feet you may want to consider another choice.",82704,4
82705,It was all I expected it to be.,82705,4
82706,Perfect for what we needed but fits a little smaller than expected,82706,4
82707,The suit laid pretty well and had easily removable pads to give a little more flexibility.,82707,4
82707,The material is very light and flows in the water perfectly without feeling like you are weighed down with wet fabric.,82707,4
82708,I loved it very sexy looking !,82708,4
82708,I hate a bit of strings coming off not that bad you can fit if by hand sowing (: but fits to the size.,82708,4
82709,My daughter loves it,82709,4
82710,XL fit a 5 foot 10 inch 34C who usually wears a size 6 bottom but the tummy material was a bit too long when not reclining or standing straight up.,82710,4
82710,"Overall, positive feedback though.",82710,4
82711,"The bottoms fit perfectly, but the top is too small.",82711,4
82712,sizing on this shirt is really wonky...,82712,4
82713,I am an athletic size 6-8 34 C bra size and the medium size fits snug.,82713,4
82713,"It is a good fit and i will wear them, but mediums usually are a bit looser on my frame.",82713,4
82714,I like this blazer but it was somewhat small.,82714,4
82714,I wouldn't fully close and I'm usually a large up top.,82714,4
82714,My daughter who is a small was able to wear it.,82714,4
82715,I wish this was 100% cotton instead of polyester.,82715,4
82716,The padding is removable.,82716,4
82716,You can find tiny holes at top right and left corners inside to remove or add more padding.,82716,4
82716,"The material is pretty stretch and comfortable, but I don't think it looks the same as the pictures.",82716,4
82716,(I feel like those are different designs and materials in the pictures.),82716,4
82716,"I've washed it twice so far (machine wash cold), still holds well, so I think it'll last.",82716,4
82716,"It's sort of sheer so I won't recommend wearing it alone, I just use it when wearing an open-back top.",82716,4
82717,"Nice although not my style,my granddaughter will love them!",82717,4
82719,"At first glance thought they were to large, but they fit.",82719,4
82719,I haven't tried working out in them yet.,82719,4
82719,You would pay a lot more if you bought them from Target.,82719,4
82721,"Sturdy and well made, you will not be able to tell that this comb is cheap.",82721,4
82721,It is comparable to the combs and accessories that you can purchase at Davids Bridal but at a more affordable price.,82721,4
82721,The simulated pearls looked okay and did not look like plastic and no glues were visible.,82721,4
82721,"If you are planning to give this as a present, make sure you change the box and pouch it came with since they were cheap imitations of Tiffany and Co.",82721,4
82721,I would suggest repackaging it and it will look pricey and more presentable.,82721,4
82721,I end up not using this for my wedding since the stylist had a different accessory recommendation however I would have not hesitated using this for my wedding day.,82721,4
82722,we made some ajustments and change the necklace.,82722,4
82722,Great option for bridesmaids,82722,4
82723,"If you like your sweats baggy, this is it!",82723,4
82723,"Need to see how it is after some washes, though.",82723,4
82726,Cute and well made.,82726,4
82727,"I wear a 38 jean, followed  mfg instructions and measured my waist,  40"" foolish pride told me to go with a 38 but I ordered  the 40 and it fit perfect!",82727,4
82727,"Like the quality, and material is 100% cotton.",82727,4
82727,"I washed in hot to test shrinkage and it only shrunk a little, still fits fine.",82727,4
82727,"This was my first kilt, always wanted one and I work  in a hot dirty environment so we will see how it holds up to severe abuse, but I'd guess it will do fine.",82727,4
82728,"Decent shirt with lightweight fabric, interior has some fraying serger stitches, but looks good when worn.",82728,4
82728,"Not a bad casual shirt, and it has been proved more durable than I expected.",82728,4
82728,Also: the plaid has a lighter blue than is shown in the picture.,82728,4
82730,I would have preferred that the pockets be smaller and more,82730,4
82732,Love the fit and the look.,82732,4
82733,It came with a few stains where the ink in the stripes was not set when folded but they are still cute!,82733,4
82734,No perfect but I definitely buy them again,82734,4
82735,Material is a little warm.,82735,4
82735,Only complaint is that the black bled when washed so now it looks a little dingy.,82735,4
82735,Luckily we used it before washing it.,82735,4
82735,Can fit pjs underneath.,82735,4
82736,"Hat was to large for me, but not my brother.",82736,4
82736,So my lost was his gain!,82736,4
82736,"""I am alright with that""!",82736,4
82736,I ordered another for me.,82736,4
82736,"The quality of the material is good for my needs and it looks, ""Good""!",82736,4
82736,"What else can you ask for, He thanks you!!",82736,4
82737,"it was a bit tight, and the zipper failed, i didn't even get to wear it once.",82737,4
82737,"i will be replacing the zipper when i get a chance, hoping it will not be a difficult job?",82737,4
82737,I love Starry Starry Night.,82737,4
82737,such a great pattern or design.,82737,4
82738,These run on the small size !,82738,4
82738,They are soft as can be !,82738,4
82738,Son has very sensitive skin and these seem to not bother his skin.very happy and will be buying more .,82738,4
82739,Great Sporty Hang-Ote Shirt!,82739,4
82740,Runs on the small side.,82740,4
82740,Buy a size larger,82740,4
82741,I really like this suit.,82741,4
82741,"I have a fat baby and should have read the reviews and ordered a six up, but at 16 lbs with fat legs, this still works.",82741,4
82741,I just pull it up so it fits more closely on her pelvis than a regular diaper.,82741,4
82742,"The printing on it is a little sticky, it probably has to be washed inside out in order to stay in good condition.",82742,4
82742,Overall I like it though!,82742,4
82743,"True to size and description,  looked very cute over my floral dress.",82743,4
82745,This dress fits great and looks great with gladiator sandals or heels.,82745,4
82745,Looks just like the pic.,82745,4
82746,"Perfect length for me, but I'm 5'3"".",82746,4
82746,So taller gals may want to reconsider.,82746,4
82747,"nice shirt, a little on the short side though",82747,4
82748,It is a beautiful prayer shawl for the low price.,82748,4
82748,"Although I am not experienced with using  one, I love it.",82748,4
82748,"I love the verse in each of the four corners and the lined case to hold it, is a work of art also.",82748,4
82748,The only thing I wish is that it had a translation of the words along the side of the shawl.,82748,4
82748,"The only time I've seen one worn is in the DVD  The Harbinger Man and he is a Rabbi, preaching a sermon.",82748,4
82748,"I put mine on as a ""sacramental"" to help focus on prayer, much as I would use a Rosary.",82748,4
82748,"I love the ""Grafted In"" symbol on the case and the shawl.",82748,4
82749,This bathing suit is very sexy.,82749,4
82749,I worried about the bottom when I first wore it.,82749,4
82749,However I did not have a problem.,82749,4
82749,The sizing was good.,82749,4
82749,I ordered a small and it fit me well.,82749,4
82749,I am 5'3' and typically wear a small size.,82749,4
82750,"For a small, the lenses are a little bigger than I thought they'd be.",82750,4
82750,I like them though.,82750,4
82751,The nose part became uncomfortable and may need adjusting but they're cute.,82751,4
82751,I get compliments every time I wear these out.,82751,4
82752,It's cute but I wish I would have bought a small instead of medium.,82752,4
82752,It's very soft and comfortable but looks a little big on me.,82752,4
82753,They weren't really the socks I was looking for.,82753,4
82753,I thought they would be more cushioned and lower.,82753,4
82753,"My fault, not theirs.",82753,4
82755,My husband LOVES this on me.,82755,4
82755,It would be 5 stars but it doesn't actually tie in front as it looks like it does.,82755,4
82756,I purchased the AWOCAL0181 style round neck cardigan in ivory.,82756,4
82756,I do really like the sweater and may consider ordering another color.,82756,4
82756,The quality surprised me.,82756,4
82756,It feels well made and isn't too thin of a material.,82756,4
82756,It has substance and feels like a cardigan you'd see at Nordstrom.,82756,4
82756,"I am typically an 8/10, ordered a medium (though other users of the same size ordered large) because I intend to wear it open.",82756,4
82756,It fits good but a little weird.,82756,4
82756,"If I wear it buttoned all the way up it's fitted at the waist and hips (comfortably, not constricting) but it feels loose up top and in the arms.",82756,4
82756,"Not a major complaint, just a bit strange.",82756,4
82756,Definitely glad I didn't order a large because of that!,82756,4
82756,Overall happy with the sweater and for the price I can't really complain.,82756,4
82757,"I do like this bathing suit, but for buying an extra large the top is a little small.",82757,4
82758,Fit a bit too tight in the waist.,82758,4
82758,Not as comfortable as some other leggings I purchased on Amazon.,82758,4
82758,They are a very good quality.,82758,4
82759,This case is more for cosmetic purposes.,82759,4
82759,"It has a very ""velvety"" feel to it, the print is consistent, and it is more of an opaque than it is clear.",82759,4
82759,"It completely covers the back of the phone, minus the speaker, camera, and flash.",82759,4
82759,"It also covers the sides minus the volume control, and power buttons.",82759,4
82759,"It does NOT cover the top, bottom or front, at all.",82759,4
82759,"The plastic/acrylic is hard, but if it was slipped off my phone, it wouldn't stand 5 minutes with my kids.",82759,4
82759,"For the price though, I'd buy again!",82759,4
82760,This dress is more of a bathing suit cover up and that is exactly what I use it for.,82760,4
82760,It is cheaper lace and completely see through.,82760,4
82761,Now my sis has a shirt for breast cancer month!,82761,4
82761,Thank you very much!,82761,4
82762,Purchased for a friend's little one.,82762,4

82764,I purchased a black one the first time and lost it.,82764,4
82764,It was my go to hat on cold days!,82764,4
82764,This time I got a beautiful blue and a taupe which came as 2 ok.,82764,4
82765,"Color is burnt orange, preferable personally.",82765,4
82765,"Have noticed some pilling under the arms, but since it's just a t-shirt I don't mind much.",82765,4
82766,"Very comfortable, nice material, well made.",82766,4
82766,Just what I was looking for...,82766,4
82769,"Cute, comfy and sturdy for an active 20 month old!",82769,4
82770,I like it but the fabric has a shine to it and seems a little big but I will still wear it.,82770,4
82770,I'd rather it be a little big then too small.,82770,4
82770,My husband really liked it on me.,82770,4
82772,This dress fits perfect ..,82772,4
82772,It's  so comfortable...,82772,4
82772,"The only con that I would say is that if you have large breast, get it a size bigger.",82772,4
82772,It fits really snug around the bust area.. Great material and I love the length .,82772,4
82775,"These are great most of the time, but if you're going to be moving around a lot or working, they don't stay in place well.",82775,4
82776,Loved this dress for my wedding.,82776,4
82776,"The only complaint I have, was there was a purple line on the dress when I received it.",82776,4
82776,Thank God it was so small that nobody noticed but me.,82776,4
82777,"Fast ship, product arrived as described.",82777,4
82778,Costume jewelry that looks good.,82778,4
82779,The shirt is true to size and the lights are very bright the only reason I didn't give 5 s is because I don't know how long the life of the lights is but other than that great buy I'll definitely be ordering more and would recommend,82779,4
82780,"It is a nice sweater, good for layering.",82780,4
82780,"It is thinner than expected, but is a really nice sweater.",82780,4
82781,Love this but it smells soo bad like an old warehouse other than that ot fits well,82781,4
82782,Very comfortable and SPF 50,82782,4
82783,My husband and I bought this necklace for a 10 year old as a Christmas gift.,82783,4
82783,"We have not gotten feedback from her, but we both liked it very much.",82783,4
82783,"I appears to be be good quality - did not have the ""cheap junk"" look that so many children's necklaces have.",82783,4
82784,"The same for this as for the previous  dooney & bourke purchase , she was over joyed when i gave it to her .",82784,4
82785,Nothing fancy..ok for the price,82785,4
82786,They fit and were delivered on time.,82786,4
82787,Works just right as an ugly sweater running shirt.,82787,4
82787,Purchased for Christmas themed run.,82787,4
82787,Only downside is sleeves are a tad too long.,82787,4
82787,Normally wear L but knew I'd be layering.,82787,4
82788,4 weeks ago I acquired and has worked very well so far.,82788,4
82788,Lack water resistance test,82788,4
82789,These are nice socks.,82789,4
82789,"So far, no shrinkage or slippage, decent thickness and nice stretch for a lightweight pair of socks, and they cover an average-sized foot in Hogwarts fun.",82789,4
82789,I enjoy wearing these hidden with suits.,82789,4
82789,No one knows I'm secretly casting the muffliato charm in long meetings that should have been emails.,82789,4
82789,So why four stars?,82789,4
82789,"Because in this pricey 5-pack, I got three Hogwarts crest socks and one Hufflepuff (see photo), rather than two of each.",82789,4
82789,"It's cool, though - I'm a Ravenclaw.",82789,4
82789,"I usually share my special socks with a Hufflepuff friend, but she'll just have to be disappointed this time.",82789,4
82790,Gives the wedding dress that flare n keeps u cool.,82790,4
82791,"great value and removable and adjustable ""H""",82791,4
82792,"It's great, just make sure you're obviously VERY comfortable in your own skin before wearing out!",82792,4
82792,":) Very silky material, stays cool while you're dancing or out and not too small-fitting as many ""rave"" items are but definitely order up a size if you are curvier in the hips.",82792,4
82792,"TONS of boob room, ha.",82792,4
82794,Smaller than I expected but no worries.,82794,4
82796,"My daughter loved the colors, and with an average amount of care it looks like they'll last awhile.",82796,4
82796,My one complaint is they're not as thick as I thought they'd be.,82796,4
82796,"Since they're called leg ""warmers"" I expected them to be ""warm"".",82796,4
82796,"More stylish than warm, but still cute, and for the price they're not bad.",82796,4
82797,Set is very pretty.,82797,4
82797,Wish the band was a little thicker.,82797,4
82798,very pretty works great,82798,4
82799,I had purchased a size 24 months for my 23 month old son's swim lessons.,82799,4
82799,"Granted, he is big for his age, and I know they are supposed to be snug so no accidents slip out, but they were small.",82799,4
82799,"So I purchased a size up (3t) and they were perfect in the elastic bands, but really baggy in the front.",82799,4
82799,The quality of them are great though!,82799,4
82799,Super happy with that aspect.,82799,4
82800,"Looked a little bigger but fit nice
Love them",82800,4
82801,I like it but I got one that was to small then sent it back and went up two sizes like other reviews said bit then it was too big so I would go with one size up.,82801,4
82801,Other than the sizing it's made very well and I'll be buying another one hopefully that fits this time!,82801,4
82802,"This peignoir set is beautiful, but was somewhat too large.",82802,4
82802,I'm unable to return or exchange it so I'll be doing my own alteration.,82802,4
82802,I only wish the sizing was as wonderful as the quality and appearance of the items.,82802,4
82804,"I love the dress, Love the material.",82804,4
82804,"I based on the size chart and ordered a size 10, but it was somewhat bigger than what I expected... had to returned it :(",82804,4
82805,"The top is very cute, however the color is different that what is pictured.",82805,4
82805,"It is blue, but the blue in the image appears to have a shimmery or silver tinged, the actual shirt is a bit brighter.",82805,4
82805,"The shirt itself is very cute, but I am holding off final review to see how well it washes and if it shrinks.",82805,4
82805,"The product arrived without any labels on the garment for wash ability, so I am hoping it is machine washable.",82805,4
82806,I'm pleased with the Backpack in all respects except it is a little more bulky overall then I anticipated.,82806,4
82806,"I use it frequently for carrying swimming items (towel, goggles, etc) when going to the pool.",82806,4
82806,I had hoped to also use it when traveling - pack in my carryon or backpack for use on day trips; however it is a bit too bulky for packing.,82806,4
82807,"Super soft and I like how it balloons out a little at the bottom, straps aren't adjustable but fit perfectly.",82807,4
82807,A little snug in top but good for at home.,82807,4
82807,Another one I ordered had to ship back tho cuz top part was too snug!,82807,4
82807,"Happy with purchase, didn't like the tax/shipping when I have Prime but I guess that's how they make their money!",82807,4
82808,"It's ok, not exactly the fit I was hoping for",82808,4
82810,"They look nice, but were actually bigger than I thought (I have tiny hands however).",82810,4
82810,"Problem is all of them were too big so it was almost impossible for me to wear without it falling off, so I had to use pliers to reshape them and make them fittable (which was a pain by the way).",82810,4
82810,"Also since I read that the paint chip (and they have while I was refitting them), I decided to paint them with a matte coat of nail polish and now they look lovely, and will probably last longer too.",82810,4
82811,Fit a little smaller than expected.,82811,4
82811,"He was 22 months and about 29 lbs and a 24 month fits okay, but when wet we have lots of plumbers crack going on.",82811,4
82811,It is a high quality swimsuit though!,82811,4
82812,Awesome shirt...size runs a bit small though...thats okay its running season and Im sure within a month I will be wearing it.,82812,4
82813,I really love this hat.,82813,4
82813,I bought this and a thicker one for the winter as I was looking for something with a brim.,82813,4
82813,It's slouchy and comfortable.,82813,4
82813,This is a better hat to wear in the fall or spring where you might not want to keep your head as toasty as you would in the winter.,82813,4
82813,"I probably wouldn't wear it in the summer because it is made out of thicker material

The only problem I've noticed with this hat in particular is that because it's slouchy it will creep down over my forehead, so I end up having to readjust it frequently.",82813,4
82813,"Overall, super cute hat and I do love it.",82813,4
82813,I just wish it would stay in place,82813,4
82814,Missing one stone but very nice.,82814,4
82814,A little large for my wrist bur I can wear.,82814,4
82816,Not as nice as the picture... but it is still an amazing warm and adorable,82816,4
82818,"Bought this to wear as part of an elektra costume, and for that purpose it was spot on.",82818,4
82818,The 'boob pads' (not sure how else to refer to these??),82818,4
82818,"are removable, which means you can also add chicken fillets in there for a costume if you need.",82818,4
82818,"I did find I needed to keep hoiking my 'boobs' up throughout the day though, as the costume was a little short for my body (I'm 5'10"" and am a size 6/8).",82818,4
82818,"The colour is great, and I love the little see through mesh bits throughout the bodice.",82818,4
82818,"The gathered ruffles make it very flattering on the figure, and the price makes you feel like you could have one in every colour.",82818,4
82819,The arm's lace are long,82819,4
82820,"Cool comfort, wish they were slightly larger though",82820,4

82821,Agree with other reviewers sizing recommendations.,82821,4
82822,Nice material.fit well and comfortable to wear.,82822,4
82823,These shorts are very comfortable and a good buy for the price.,82823,4
82823,They have a nice breathable material.,82823,4
82823,"However, they were shorter and smaller than I expected them to be.",82823,4
82823,"I ordered a small, which is what I wear in most work-out type shorts.",82823,4
82823,"For these, I probably should have ordered a medium so that they would be a little more comfortable to wear in public.",82823,4
82823,"For now, I just wear them as a loung around the house pair of shorts and they work perfect for that.",82823,4
82823,I might would order these again in a bigger size.,82823,4
82824,Pretty good quality for being from China.,82824,4
82824,True religion symbol doesn't look too great but it works.,82824,4
82824,This shirt does shrink a lot so order a size up at least.,82824,4
82825,Gets the job done.,82825,4
82825,The key is somewhat loose under the band but I don't think it will be an issue.,82825,4
82825,Fits around my iPhone 6s pretty easily.,82825,4
82825,Holds the cards firmly in place.,82825,4
82825,It's a unique little wallet.,82825,4
82826,I liked them but I thought it was a plain print but it has designs on it...my bad but they're still fitting well :),82826,4
82827,Like- should have ordered a size smaller.,82827,4
82828,I really like it,82828,4
82830,According to my groomsman it fit perfectly.,82830,4
82831,I'm very fond of these!,82831,4
82831,I think they look really nice and I love the little row of pearls peeking out behind my ear.,82831,4
82832,Used for Negan costume was a hit.,82832,4
82834,"I am very happy with this, but I wish the stones were a bit larger.",82834,4
82834,Very delicate and pretty,82834,4
82835,"Good quality, but the top was way too large for my teen; has to return.",82835,4
82836,It looks very nice/,82836,4
82837,For the price these are great!,82837,4
82837,My only reservation is that the stud is too long.,82837,4
82837,"It isn't flush with my skin on the inside of the nose, it pokes into the other side and hurts a little.",82837,4
82837,But this only happens if someone hit it or you are kissing etc.,82837,4
82837,"This will affect the way it stays in too, it has fallen out a lot bc of it.",82837,4
82837,BUT that is why you have over 60 of them.,82837,4
82837,"So far the diamonds haven't come out yet, which i have had happened the day after i had bought a ring (not these) But I would reccommend.",82837,4
82838,It was a size smaller than expected.,82838,4
82838,Some of the beeds fell off upon trying it on.,82838,4
82838,But it looks great,82838,4
82839,A novel time piece.,82839,4
82839,Great price but you get what you pay for.,82839,4
82840,very beautiful and and practical however the color of the silver loop is much brighter than in the picture,82840,4
82842,Just the color is not how I expected.,82842,4
82842,This is more likely royal blue than navy.,82842,4
82842,I liked the length though.,82842,4
82842,"I'm 168 cm and 57 kg (5' 6"" and 125 Ibs).",82842,4
82842,I ordered size S and it covers my butt.,82842,4
82842,The product is clingy and there is a mild odor on it but shipping is really fast.,82842,4
82843,"Will continue to purchase more blouses, also I would like to see more nice dresses below the knees",82843,4
82844,This is super cool.,82844,4
82844,"Only gave it a 4 star because the construction of it makes it a little flimsy, but it really does look like the Grimm key and that makes it a wonderful collectible for the price.",82844,4
82845,I really love this skirt!,82845,4
82845,"If you follow the size chart in the description, it will fit.",82845,4
82845,"The only problems I have with the skirt is the zipper is a bit difficult to work with and the skirt is actually longer than I expected, but that's probably because I got an XL when I'm usually an L (again, follow the sizing chart!",82845,4
82845,"), but these aren't problems that can't be fixed easily.",82845,4
82847,"I really like this dress, Im 15 weeks pregnant and bought this hoping to wear it throughout most of my pregnancy.",82847,4
82847,"It is very soft and flowy and hits right at my ankles, Im 5'6.",82847,4
82847,The colors are as pictured.,82847,4
82847,"The reason I gave this 4 stars is because its pricey for a maxi, its slightly see throw, Ill wear it with leggins, which isn't a big deal to me",82847,4
82848,"I like it, but the thing is..all of my pairs were alright, except for the rose quartz.",82848,4
82848,Which looks like marble or something.,82848,4
82848,"Other than that, I liked the product.",82848,4
82850,Slightly large - love the color!,82850,4
82851,Came faster than expected it's soft but a little smaller than I expected but still super cute,82851,4
82852,They smell like metal so I'm very sure they have knickle in them!,82852,4
82852,Either way they look great and the colors are awesome!,82852,4
82853,"I have to say, this jacket is pretty rad!",82853,4
82853,"The jacket came pretty much as shown, with some minor differences in the shape of the scorpion patch's tail and pincers and some two-toned coloring in it's stitching in what appears to be an attempt to give it some shadowing depth.",82853,4
82853,"Also, to my dismay, the collar is angled instead of rounded like in the photo, which adds a little too much heft to the collar for my taste.",82853,4
82853,The fitting seems pretty good.,82853,4
82853,"I'm a little under 6ft and weigh about 145lbs and ordered a small, I'm a thin guy and prefer a snug fit.",82853,4
82853,"The maneuverability is pretty good, but the sleeves are a bit short for me and the jacket pulls up exposing some midriff when I raise my hands over my head.",82853,4
82853,"The jacket itself has a padded insulation and feels a bit poofy, but is comfortable once you get used to it.",82853,4
82853,"The padding doesn't appear to make it look poofy, but it does cause it to feel very warm.",82853,4
82853,"This jacket seems suitable enough to keep me warm all winter without a problem (I live in Southern Arizona), but I haven't fully tested it out in the cold yet.",82853,4
82853,There are four pockets (two outside and two inside) big enough to fit a wallet or cellphone in.,82853,4
82853,"One of the down sides to this jacket was that it seemed to be covered in some sort of oily substance when I received it and had a pretty bad chemical smell, like fresh dye possibly.",82853,4
82853,I had to wash it three times before the smell was bearable.,82853,4
82853,"It recommends to get it dry cleaned, but I machine washed it on a gentle setting and it seems to be holding up just fine.",82853,4
82853,Overall a good buy for the price.,82853,4
82853,"I think it'd get the job done for a really good looking cosplay, and more importantly, makes for a totally radical jacket to rock for a night out on the town!",82853,4
82854,"These shorts came in on time, 2 days after shipping.",82854,4
82854,They seem very well made and sturdy.,82854,4
82854,The fabric is very thick and warm.,82854,4
82854,I am 5'2 and around 110 pounds.,82854,4
82854,"I ordered a small, which are a little too big for me but will work.",82854,4
82854,"I may order again, but would suggest to anyone around my size to go for an extra small.",82854,4
82854,"Overall, fairly nice product",82854,4
82855,It seems to get bigger when you actually get them wet.,82855,4
82855,Great build quality otherwise.,82855,4
82856,Great dress for the price,82856,4
82858,I got the 32 Waist x 34 Length.,82858,4
82858,"I'm 5' 11"" 170 lbs and it fits me great but the ideal size probably would have been 33 waist just for alittle breathing room.",82858,4
82858,"Look great too, love the gray color.",82858,4
82859,Bottoms are a tad loose and the top almost doesn't cover my nipple but it's as good as it's gonna get the colors are nice,82859,4
82860,I'm a bigger girl normally a 3x so I wasn't 100 % confident if these would fit but they have a lot of stretch to them.,82860,4
82860,"when I first pulled them out of the bag, I thought there's no way but they stretch and fit great.",82860,4
82860,"They only downside is the fabric is quite thick, which is great for winter but definitely not for summer",82860,4
82861,Great for Halloween or Cosplay  Hot on the inside (Like wearing flannel lined boots).,82861,4
82861,I wear 10.5 shoes.,82861,4
82861,The 11's were snug but not uncomfortable.,82861,4
82862,I bought the hat for the wife for Christmas.,82862,4
82862,She's been wearing it the last couple of days and really loves the wool.,82862,4
82862,It has been very cold and windy here.,82862,4
82862,The color is slightly darker than I thought it would be.,82862,4
82863,"Material is cheap, but it is very comfortable and super cute!!!",82863,4
82863,I can't wait to wear this out!,82863,4
82863,Caveat emptor: The shipping and handling fees are more than the costs of the outfit.,82863,4
82864,Some socks are too tight but overall good product,82864,4
82865,Pretty soft and cool Love the design,82865,4
82866,"A tad to big, but still a great fit!",82866,4
82867,Very large size bag!,82867,4
82867,I love how roomy it is.,82867,4
82867,"I would give 5 stars, but the zippers are awful.",82867,4
82867,They are just a pain to close.,82867,4
82867,Other than that it's a great price.,82867,4
82869,Washing carefully - seems to have tightened around the neck and shrunk already,82869,4
82870,These shorts are very comfortable and not too short.,82870,4
82871,Wallet will only hold cards at certain places of the wallet itself.,82871,4
82871,Better construction on the closing clip,82871,4
82872,This dashiki is so pretty it's just like the picture it's just that the material is silky .,82872,4
82872,Amd if you want to make it fit like a dress just order a bigger size .,82872,4
82873,They are very cute.,82873,4
82873,I bought them to use as small gifts and they will work for that.,82873,4
82873,But they are cheaper looking in person.,82873,4
82873,But I do have several and I do wear them.,82873,4
82874,"Very warm, waterproof, and firs as expected.",82874,4
82874,They've done well during many hours of playing in the snow.,82874,4
82875,"I maybe ordered a size smaller, I'm not sure if I should struggle to put it on.",82875,4
82875,"Haha but oh well, just gives me more motivation to work harder.",82875,4
82876,Very colorful stones altogether its a beautiful pair of earrings.,82876,4
82876,The posts came badly bent and I fixed them myself.,82876,4
82876,The making looks good.,82876,4
82877,Finding a great strapless bra is hard when you have a big chest.,82877,4
82877,This bra stays in place and doesn't ride down.,82877,4
82877,"It fits true to size (I'm a 34 DD and it fit perfectly) it has strips that help it stay up on the top and bottom area of the bra, but no option for straps.",82877,4
82877,"I would recommend this bra to anyone, especially big busted girls.",82877,4
82877,It does get uncomfortable after a while.,82877,4
82877,"but hey, you can't really get around that when you have a lot of chest weight.",82877,4
82877,"I would say this is the best strapless bra you can get for the price, but price aside, its a steal and a great find.",82877,4
82879,"Love the size and pockets; however, the hook is the smallest hook I've ever seen on a bag.",82879,4
82879,Much less one of this size.,82879,4
82879,"i would recommend this bag, but the hook often causes hanging issues.",82879,4
82880,Nice addition to our Plus Sized Summer White Collection...we also have the Black Model,82880,4
82881,"Socks do not stay on heel, but love coverage on the front of foot.",82881,4
82882,Cute and very soft.,82882,4
82883,Our birthday boy was thrilled with these!,82883,4
82883,The lights are bright white.,82883,4
82883,They seem decent quality.,82883,4
82883,"My eldest had a Lightning McQueen pair, they fell apart in the end but it was after a good amount of hard wear and for the price I am happy enough.",82883,4
82884,It came out nice,82884,4
82885,I LOVE the wine color- but the thighs are just a little too tight for me.,82885,4
82885,I have soccer-player thighs and always have a hard time finding something that fits my waist AND thighs... and this was no exception.,82885,4
82885,"Very cool, and water resistant, but I couldn't see myself hiking all day in them comfortably.",82885,4
82886,Will purchase other colors.,82886,4
82887,Came in good condition and was as advertised.,82887,4
82888,I love the saying and the color of the shirt .,82888,4
82888,"the design is nice, although orange on burgundy is not my first choice, it looks just fine.",82888,4
82888,"I have too many sweatshirts, but this one was so ""me"" I had to buy it!",82888,4
82888,"It might run just a bit small (after a wash) - not too much so, but enough to consider if you are ""in between"" sizes.",82888,4
82889,When I saw these shoes I decided that I had to have them even if I never wore them.,82889,4
82889,They are too cute!,82889,4
82889,"The length is very true to size (I wear an 8, and ordered an 8).",82889,4
82889,"They DO run a bit wide, but I put a spiffy pair of red and black dotted insoles in them and it helped tremendously.",82889,4
82889,Plan on putting some in anyway because the shoes have VERY little (actually none) cushioning.,82889,4
82889,"I wouldn't plan on long distance hiking in these shoes; they're more the, ""Look at my adorable, red suede shoes,"" style.",82889,4
82889,"However, at this price you can afford to own a pair of somewhat impractical, but ""darn they're cute"" shoes.",82889,4
82889,I'm just glad my daughter wears a size 6 or they'd be in her closet instead of mine!,82889,4
82890,I wear a 14 and I bought a 3xl.,82890,4
82890,I wish I had more support in the chest area.,82890,4
82890,The material is thin and the fringe is not as full as the picture.,82890,4
82890,For the price....it's ok for me.,82890,4
82892,I really like the Wrightsocks!,82892,4
82892,They are great running socks!,82892,4
82892,"Not sure what I think about the tabs, but they are a great brand of running sock!",82892,4
82893,"I liked the skirt shown but when it arrived and I tried it on, it was small and rode up.",82893,4
82893,The fabric was thin.,82893,4
82894,"Although I love satin nightgowns, I ordered a size bigger than what I need.",82894,4
82894,"Unfortunately, the sizing is inaccurate.",82894,4
82894,Did not fit as the description.,82894,4
82894,tight through the shoulders.,82894,4
82895,"Got a size M , It fits perfectly and its so comfortable .",82895,4
82897,The top was a little loose.,82897,4
82899,"the material is good I love it, im pretty short so its like a normal short cute dress to me but it was really worth the spending",82899,4
82900,Very nice and chick !,82900,4
82901,I received it yesterday {shipping was fast} and love the design .hoping it will shrink a little after washing.,82901,4
82902,"This is super cute, but it's way too short for me to wear as a dress.",82902,4
82902,I think that I'll be able to pair it with leggings and flats and make it work.,82902,4
82902,"The material is stretchy, and it has a silkier feel than what I was expecting, which is good.",82902,4
82902,"Overall, I can't complain about much since the price is so reasonable, but unless you're pretty tiny, I wouldn't get this expecting to wear it as a dress.",82902,4
82903,We're purchased for a costume and worked great.,82903,4
82904,"Pants material is fabulous, but my frame is not within the size chart listed",82904,4
82905,"Gorgeous, I love this dress and it accentuates all my curves!",82905,4
82906,I like the shirt ... Just need a bigger size.,82906,4
82907,Pretty necklace for the price.,82907,4
82907,Unfortunately a part of the chain was broken when it came in.,82907,4
82907,I plan to glue it back on and hopefully that will work.,82907,4
82908,He wears it every week.,82908,4
82908,"After a few washings, the lettering has faded somewhat, but it still looks great.",82908,4
82908,It's the kind that doesn't wrinkle too easily.,82908,4
82908,Smooth material and a great fit are the most you can ask for in a tshirt and this shirt has it!,82908,4
82908,"Also, my son was apprehensive about wearing a v neck, but the v in this shirt is not too deep so he is still comfortable in it.",82908,4
82909,These earrings look very cute and the set comes with a lot of cute colors to match to any outfit.,82909,4
82909,"My only complaint is that these don't come with metal earring backs, only some tiny cheap rubber backs that are usually used to hold the metal backs in place on store bought earrings.",82909,4
82910,I got these to hand out as Christmas gifts.,82910,4
82910,"When I got them, one of the hooks wasn't bent enough, so it wasn't catching on the butterfly to close properly.",82910,4
82910,I fixed it by applying pressure and bending a hook a little bit.,82910,4
82910,"Also, one of the stickers was hanging off the metal base.",82910,4
82910,I simply moved it back to where it was supposed to be and it stayed in place.,82910,4
82910,"Hopefully it won't come off again, or I might have to glue it down.",82910,4
82910,"The hooks are also a little bit wobbly compared to my own purse hook, which seems to be a bit heavier and better quality.",82910,4
82910,Hopefully they will last when put to use.,82910,4
82910,"They are a great buy for the money overall, despite the minor issues.",82910,4
82911,this piece is beautiful but too big !,82911,4
82911,"and fake looking, i'm giving it a 4 because the earrings were nicely made",82911,4
82912,"Really beautiful, but it's a toddler's size, so my 4 year old could not wear the size medium that I ordered.",82912,4
82913,My favorite from this company.,82913,4
82913,"Made well, no fraying, the bow was secure, they fit wonderfully!",82913,4
82914,It is more orange than red but I love it still its super soft and going to be extremely warm when it gets cold enough!,82914,4
82915,Lovely dress- but surprisingly short.,82915,4
82915,"I have three different Allegra K dresses like this one, and this is by far the shortest.",82915,4
82915,"A little more booty advertising than I expected, but great quality.",82915,4
82916,Was a gift and was very well received!,82916,4
82917,"Great stitching, soft fabric.",82917,4
82917,Only complaint would be the pattern seems somewhat muted compared with the color of the shirt (Heather blue),82917,4
82918,The color is amazing!,82918,4
82918,Cant wait to wear during an evening beach night ;),82918,4
82920,I loved the quality!,82920,4
82920,I have shirts from $30-$70 and this felt as good if not better!,82920,4
82920,My shirt is extremely tight and I will probably only wear it a few times because of that.,82920,4
82920,Order a size larger than you normally would even if you think you should not.,82920,4
82920,Great shirt and great price.,82920,4
82921,these are exactly as posted.. many cute designs.. shipped really quickly.,82921,4
82921,"I didn't really even mean to order this item, but I like them.",82921,4
82922,It does fit a bit loose but very comfortable.,82922,4
82922,"For a hiking pant, it should be a bit loose.",82922,4
82922,The wine red is a beautiful color.,82922,4
82922,Good value at $31.,82922,4
82923,"this is a great hat, it just isn't quite as deep down on my head as I was hoping for.",82923,4
82923,And I don't have a gigantic melon,82923,4
82924,was a little large in the breast area,82924,4
82926,Comfortable but does run a little large.,82926,4
82927,for the wife and she loved them,82927,4
82929,"The fabric is a bit thin, but my daughter just wears a tank top underneath and loves it.",82929,4
82930,The lens color is going to be the color of everything you see so be sure you like it.,82930,4
82930,They are effective and I think they look nice on me.,82930,4
82931,My kid loves mittens so he wears these as fashion accessories.,82931,4
82931,"They are not the densest fleece, so I do not think they would be great for really cold weather.",82931,4
82931,We live in the south where it frost is a big deal so not very cold.,82931,4
82931,But they are stitched well and are cute.,82931,4
82932,Looks good on too,82932,4
82933,"Good quality, looks nice.",82933,4
82933,"A little too bulky of a fit for me, a medium may have been better.",82933,4
82933,Still a quality item I'll wear.,82933,4
82933,I'm a slimmer build and usually wear large in slim or modern fit when it comes to shirts.,82933,4
82933,This shirt has a little too much material in the mid section for me.,82933,4
82934,Gave as gift to a friend.,82934,4
82934,Just expected the material to be a bit cleaner.,82934,4
82935,Fits well and comes in good colors.,82935,4
82936,This little fleece is adorable.,82936,4
82936,It keeps my daughter warm and so so cute!,82936,4
82936,I only wish it was better at blocking the wind.,82936,4
82937,"I use it every day, charging the Casio at night.",82937,4
82937,It is infinitely easier than chasing the sun.,82937,4
82937,Have had no luck with customer support despite repeated attempts.,82937,4
82937,Figured it out by trial and error and found out that I like it.,82937,4
82937,"Not as ""cheap"" as the sun but much more user friendly.",82937,4
82938,"very nice top, but by mistake I ordered the same top with a different placement of the pattern.",82938,4
82939,I am 4'11 petite person and ordered a small!,82939,4
82939,"It was very long for me and because I am not busty enough, the top fitted me loose.",82939,4
82939,"(See posture) 
I didn't return it because I know someone who could tailor dress for a cheap price.",82939,4
82939,So I didn't complain.,82939,4
82939,"I love the material, and the price was perfect!",82939,4
82939,I ordered exactly 4 dresses for a Quinceanera.,82939,4
82939,"2 small, 1 medium and 1 large.",82939,4
82939,"Medium size is not that big of a difference from small, I'll admit I was disappointed.",82939,4
82939,"The large was ok, but it needed to be bigger.",82939,4
82939,"All in all, we had them all tailored and loves the price!",82939,4
82940,Gloves interior lining tends to come out with your fingers upon removal of hand from glove.,82940,4
82940,That's disappointing given the cost of the gloves.,82940,4
82940,Not necessarily any warmer than my older gloves of average quality so I am also little disappointed about that.,82940,4
82940,But I do like the zipper pocket on the top of the glove for a warming packet.,82940,4
82941,I like the wallet but the license slot is very difficult to manage.,82941,4
82941,I cannot get the license out without using tweezers.,82941,4
82941,The wallet is spacious and attractive- holds a lot.,82941,4
82941,But slots are very tight.,82941,4
82942,I got this for my Mother of Dragons Halloween costume.,82942,4
82942,It looked great and is fun to wear even not dressed up as her!,82942,4
82943,Great colors and material.,82943,4
82943,Runs small but I'm a size 13 so it may just be me.,82943,4
82944,Fits as expected..but tight in some areas.,82944,4
82945,This is a very nice dress.,82945,4
82945,"It was super small across the top, and the part underneed the dress.",82945,4
82945,I am going to exchange it for an extra large.,82945,4
82945,I did receive this dress at a discounted price for an honest review.,82945,4
82945,I depend on customer reviews for my online purchases and expect honesty and that's what I'm giving.,82945,4
82947,"Would give 5 stars but when I received, one of the posts were bent.",82947,4
82947,"Not sure how it happened since the earrings were in a small gift box, packed inside another box so it didn't happen in shipping.",82947,4
82947,Glad I was able to straighten it out without breaking the post off.,82947,4
82948,"It is somewhat small, but it comes in handy protecting my dome from the sun.",82948,4
82948,"You see, I shave my head daily with a Braun (seeing as I like the style) so this baby comes in handy!",82948,4
82949,The skirt fit well and looks very cute on.,82949,4
82949,"It's a little tight around the knees when you walk so you have to take smaller steps, it;s stretchy but not too stretchy.",82949,4
82950,I'm knocking off one star because the belt buckle is awkward.,82950,4
82950,"The dress arrived clean, wrapped in plastic and in perfect condition.",82950,4
82950,The cotton is thick enough it really wasn't even wrinkled.,82950,4
82950,I'll get plenty of use this summer.,82950,4
82950,I'll pair it with Ralph Lauren Cecelia denim shantung wedges.,82950,4
82951,warm but too small.,82951,4
82951,definitely not one size fits all,82951,4
82952,Snug (more than expected) but doable.,82952,4
82953,"Great for a guys, a little big for the ladies but overall was happy with the purchase and look.",82953,4
82954,really cute outfit and fits well.,82954,4
82954,Looks exactly like the picture,82954,4
82955,I like the style so I kept it.,82955,4
82955,"But it can be awkward getting used to it: the shoulders are far too small, as you can see on the model.",82955,4
82955,I like that it finishes short.,82955,4
82955,It arrived smelling like factory funk.,82955,4
82955,I washed it with hot water and added apple cider vinegar to the detergent.,82955,4
82955,No shrinkage or damage noticeable.,82955,4
82955,Now I wash it in a gentle load.,82955,4
82956,"Cute print, but they do run a bit small!",82956,4
82958,Bathing suit is cute and fairly well made but was returned because it was too small.,82958,4
82958,"Im 5'5"" 150 lbs so I ordered a large but the bottoms were still small and the top was huge",82958,4
82959,Would be a great dress if it fit me.,82959,4
82959,I normally wear a size 16 and it is at least 2 sizes too small.,82959,4
82959,If you're a size 12ish I highly recommend it!,82959,4
82960,Its not quite as green as I wanted but it is soft and beautiful.,82960,4
82960,"I ordered an e
XL and I wear an 18-20",82960,4
82961,I really do love this bikini.,82961,4
82961,The top fits great and even has a metal hook/clasp at the back which I love since plastic ones do not last in sun and chlorine.,82961,4
82961,The bottoms are a little on the smaller side of size 18.,82961,4
82961,They are not as stretchy as most swimsuits either so fits a little tight on the waist/hip.,82961,4
82962,dont put it in the dryer tho!,82962,4
82963,it's a cheap hat and that's what I ordered.,82963,4
82963,It does what it's supposed to do.,82963,4
82964,daughter seems to like them,82964,4
82965,Would've given 5 stars but the bottoms are pretty tiny.,82965,4
82965,The top fits perfectly cause I'm a 32/34 B.,82965,4
82965,Definitely order a size up,82965,4
82966,Love the feel of the fabric.,82966,4
82966,Does seem to run a little small.,82966,4
82969,"Sleeves are wide, but otherwise nice quality shirt.",82969,4
82970,"Great cover up for my lower half  lol
A,tat bit smaller than expected but love them.",82970,4
82970,"Length is ok but I'm used to that cause I'm 5'1""
Perfect for my cruise.",82970,4
82970,Will use with a tanking top,82970,4
82971,Nice tunic; good fit,82971,4
82972,Not sure I still like it... Looks a bit old.,82972,4
82973,I love the length and it fits comfortably,82973,4
82974,GOOD CLEAN SHOES THAT LOOK JUST LIKE IT,82974,4
82975,Each layer of the bracelet overlaps a bit more than the picture shows.,82975,4
82975,"Other than that, these are a good deal and look nice on.",82975,4
82975,They make a nice little stocking stuffer-type gift.,82975,4
82976,Packaged very nicely for a gift.,82976,4
82976,Much more dainty in person.,82976,4
82976,Was hoping it would be larger but still a very nice set.,82976,4
82977,"I love the description, fast delivery and great packaging",82977,4

82979,These have really surprised me!,82979,4
82979,They are great for the price.,82979,4
82979,They even look pretty clean under a t-shirt.,82979,4
82979,They DEFINITELY run small tho.,82979,4
82979,I originally ordered medium (thinking 34B) but way too small!,82979,4
82979,Returned for XL which fit very good.,82979,4
82979,Have machine washed multiple times and air dry and they hold shape well.,82979,4
82980,Tiny bit large but great quality,82980,4
82981,Not an expensive piece but pretty and one of those things perfect for everyday wear,82981,4
82983,"I am 5'5""; 130lbs- got a medium.",82983,4
82983,"A bit big, but perfectly fine & will probably shrink in wash so will be perfect then.",82983,4
82983,For cost & delivered fast.,82983,4
82984,I wish the straps could be adjusted up.,82984,4
82985,I wish I hadn't followed the reviews on this item.,82985,4
82985,"This dress is super comfortable, well made, and would have been perfect, but I went up a size.",82985,4
82985,This dress has a lot of stretch to the top as well!,82985,4
82985,"Will be returning this item for the small, I am 5' 105lbs.",82985,4
82986,"TOOK A WHILE TO COME, BUT LOOKS NICE.",82986,4
82988,"A good pair of shorts, comfortable.",82988,4
82988,Hopefully they will be as long lasting as previously used shorts were.,82988,4
82990,Waist stoic a little high,82990,4
82991,I purchased the mermaid scale leggings in green.,82991,4
82991,Love the print and the quality of fabric.,82991,4
82991,There was no popping of stitching when I pulled them on.,82991,4
82991,"Unfortunately the color of the print became less vivid as my healthy hips and thunder thighs stretched the material, which leads me to think I might should have ordered a large instead of a medium.",82991,4
82991,"However the medium fit perfectly on my narrow waist, and they reached all the way to my ankle bone, which really made me happy!",82991,4
82991,"I am 5'10, wear a 35"" inseam with size 10 pants.",82991,4
82991,Love my scale bottoms and I Look forward to wearing them all winter!,82991,4
82994,"Was a little hard to put on, if I ever need to take the case off for any reason think the only way would be to cut it.",82994,4
82994,It looks great though!,82994,4
82995,Your getting what you pay for.,82995,4
82995,"It's not a bad deal and they work, I didn't get a great selection, but other people did so its a hit or miss.",82995,4
82995,Either way I'm still using them and they work just fine:),82995,4
82996,"Nice earring; smaller than I expected, but well-made.",82996,4
82997,"I stand at 5'8 and I weigh 152 but I measure out at a bust of 34, waist of 26-27, and hip 40 so the bottoms run a little big (because I typically wear a medium and that's what I ordered).",82997,4
82997,"The top is fine simply because it is a wrap around scarf type top, but the bottom is a little bigger.",82997,4
82997,"I will say that the green is not a darker green as it appears in the photo it's more of an olive green, but it is still beautiful.",82997,4
82997,"I would post pictures, but I haven't taken any yet simply because I'm saving it for a cruise in October, so once I'm back I'll update with photos",82997,4
82998,I like the socks they went a little higher then the knee which worked perfect with my over the knee boots,82998,4
82999,It's for my 1 year old!,82999,4
82999,"He loves hats, and enjoys taking his brothers!",82999,4
82999,He will get this for Easter,82999,4
83000,Quicker shopping than expected.,83000,4
83001,Bow fail off the same day!,83001,4
83002,Cheap but does the job well enough,83002,4
83004,Chain broke before the end of day one but the pendant is nice,83004,4
83005,I think the wallet is nice.,83005,4
83005,I wish it had a wrist strap.,83005,4
83006,"With all the reviews saying how tight it is, I got an extra large expecting it to still be a bit snug.",83006,4
83006,"It fits okay at first, perhaps a bit loose, but after a while it stretches a bit and is just too loose to be that comfy.",83006,4
83006,"I do love the skirt though, and plan on buying a smaller size as I lose weight.",83006,4
83007,"Pretty skirt - would have liked it a little longer, but quite summery",83007,4
83008,I thought they would be a little bit bigger but the size is fine.,83008,4
83009,Adjustable so my boyfriend and I can share it.,83009,4
83009,Works for both of us.,83009,4
83010,"My kids love this, but it runs a little small.",83010,4
83010,"Next time, I'll get one size up.",83010,4
83010,The strip is not tied enough.,83010,4
83010,Otherwise we love it!,83010,4
83011,Nice and fast delivery,83011,4
83012,I had to order size larger than I normally order other than that they are nice.,83012,4
83014,Top was way to big bottoms fit perfect,83014,4
83015,"I received the necklace much earlier than expected, which is great!",83015,4
83015,My only complaint is that the necklace came flawed.,83015,4
83015,A few of the stones from the necklace were loose in the bag it came in and I will have to reattach part of the hanging strands to the base.,83015,4
83015,"It is not a total loss, but I would prefer to receive an item ready to wear and not have to make any repairs.",83015,4
83016,i just had to get the length altered since im shorter.,83016,4
83018,Bought this hat for my 5mo son.,83018,4
83018,Fits like a glove!,83018,4
83018,"Love that is has an adjustable cinch strap, however, am looking forward to seeing how comfortable the actual cinch will be while laying in his carrier or stroller (the knob is directly on the back of the head).",83018,4
83018,"Lightweight, good coverage, and would buy again!",83018,4
83019,"I went by the size the top is a little large, but other than that it is very nice",83019,4
83020,I love these for my son.,83020,4
83020,They are warm and cozy,83020,4
83021,"It's a little hot for wearing now in the summer, but it is very pretty.",83021,4
83021,"I am 5'7"" and have hips.",83021,4
83021,I wear a US size 14.,83021,4
83021,I got the largest size and it is perfect.,83021,4
83021,"It's not as loose as it looks on the model, but it's not tight - very comfortable.",83021,4
83022,Order big if you want it to fit like the model.,83022,4
83022,But it's a great sweater.,83022,4
83022,A little brighter red then the pictures look too.,83022,4
83024,Items arrived as expected and look good.,83024,4
83024,"The only concern is the extended opening is a little small, if the table top is on the thick side the holders will not fit.",83024,4
83024,Other than that these are great.,83024,4
83025,The little emblem kind of wore off fairly quickly but other than that they are a great value.,83025,4
83026,"As shown; it's a gift that hasn't been received yet, but thinking she will like it alot!",83026,4
83027,I get lots of compliments on this one.,83027,4
83030,They are pretty cute,83030,4
83031,Went by size chart.,83031,4
83031,"If you have a 30"" waist go with medium instead of small.",83031,4
83032,"I am 5'10 or so, and I knew it wouldn't be long enough to be a dress, so I purchased it with the intention of wearing it as a longer shirt.",83032,4
83033,It's a nice jacket but the colors aren't near as bright as they appear in the picture.,83033,4
83033,They are VERY dark shades.,83033,4
83033,"Also, the cats on the front of the jacket have orange whiskers and orange highlights on them but the cats onthe back do not which makes for kind of a strange look.",83033,4
83033,But overall I'm glad I bought it.,83033,4
83034,Super tiny and delicate.,83034,4
83035,Arm length was a bit shorter than expected but fit great everywhere else.,83035,4
83036,Perfect size for me.,83036,4
83037,Purses aren't really my thing.,83037,4
83037,I bought it because I needed something.,83037,4
83037,I don't hate it.,83037,4
83038,I bought this for my son - he actually wears it.,83038,4
83039,Excellent fit for my wife.,83039,4
83039,She is happy to have ordered it.,83039,4
83042,I now have this vest in 2 colors & sizes.,83042,4
83042,Red L and Navy XL.,83042,4
83042,"I bought the navy one first & thought it was a little large, especially if I'm wearing a thin shirt underneath.",83042,4
83042,So I bought the red in Large.,83042,4
83042,It fits just right.,83042,4
83042,"Maybe a little snug, but not bad.",83042,4
83042,I'll wear it with my thin shirts & the navy with thicker shirts.,83042,4
83042,The vests look very nice.,83042,4
83042,I agree with others that they look like they would cost more.,83042,4
83042,I'm not sure what some other reviewers meant about the pockets being too small.,83042,4
83042,My pockets are just fine on both vests.,83042,4
83042,I'm pleased with my purchases & would (& may) order in another color.,83042,4
83042,I'm usually a 14 or a L/XL in most shirts if that helps anyone decide on which size to buy.,83042,4
83043,These ties are basically what I was wanting.,83043,4
83043,They look very nice and will work great for my wedding.,83043,4
83043,Only issue was they sent half of them in the wrong shade of grey.,83043,4
83043,I'm hoping to send them back and get that taken care of.,83043,4
83043,"Other than that, good product.",83043,4
83044,Fits as I had hoped and I don't need to iron it!!,83044,4
83045,I give it 4 stars only because it's not for short people and I'll have to carefully alter it.,83045,4
83045,"I'm 5'4"", and whereas the picture shows the front of the dress dropping mid thigh, for me it's right above my knee, and that's with 2 petticoats underneath.",83045,4
83045,Other than that it's decent for the price.,83045,4
83046,Hurts one of my ears.,83046,4
83047,Cute top somewhat snug across the chest area,83047,4
83049,"Initially, I thought it was oversized but shrunk down to normal sized XL after one washing.",83049,4
83049,Feels like a quality flannel shirt.,83049,4
83051,The little girls had fun wearing them for the birthday tea party.,83051,4
83052,I like this pin a lot.,83052,4
83052,I gave it to my hippy wife and she really likes it and wears it often.,83052,4
83053,I really love this shirt.,83053,4
83053,It was too big and I had to send it back.,83053,4
83053,"The fabric is interesting, in a good way.",83053,4
83053,"It is very smooth  and almost slick and doesn't cling to the skin, thank goodness.",83053,4
83053,The back detail on this shirt is amazing.,83053,4
83053,I love the criss-cross back.,83053,4
83053,It isn't sheer which is nice as well.,83053,4
83053,You can wear this to workout in or just with a jeans or shorts.,83053,4
83053,I am definitely going to buy a smaller size.,83053,4
83054,I'm 5'4 and 137 pounds and I got a medium and it fits perfect!!,83054,4
83055,These are soft and really comfortable.,83055,4
83055,"My only complaint was that a couple of them have started falling apart just after one wash, one has a large hole/tear between the fabric and lace and one has loose threads  coming off.",83055,4
83055,Be sure to wash these on delicate or do not dry so they last.,83055,4
83056,"Good value, nice sleek case.",83056,4
83056,It's not bulky like past covers.,83056,4
83057,Bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas.,83057,4
83057,She has had many compliments on the item and she loves it too.,83057,4
83057,One of the fringe strings was extra long when we received it.,83057,4
83057,I cut that off and haven't had problems since.,83057,4
83058,The beads pull it upside down on my wrist.,83058,4
83058,It needs an anchor bead to keep it in the right direction.,83058,4
83062,They would have gotten five stars if the draw sting hadn't broken in the first week.,83062,4
83063,Buy a size down.,83063,4
83065,"The purple ones came way darker than expected, so it's hard to tell that they aren't black if you're not in really good lighting.",83065,4
83065,"Nonetheless, this is an amazing price for three pairs of earrings.",83065,4
83065,"I'm used to paying $30-$50 per pair at piercing shops, but definitely won't be doing that again!",83065,4
83065,I'd recommend this product,83065,4
83066,I wish that the 3-4 year old size was slightly bigger since I ordered it for my child who currently wears 2T-3T (depending on brand) but this will only last him for a few months.,83066,4
83066,"Since it takes a while to be delivered, I'd recommend ordering 2 sizes up, not just one.",83066,4
83066,I ordered one size up and am pretty sure that this one won't last long.,83066,4
83066,My kid is 18 months old and 32 pounds and 36 inches.,83066,4
83066,"Big kid for his age, but I didn't think he was in 4 year old clothing quite yet??",83066,4
83066,"That being said, this is an amazing price for a little hipster baby outfit so I can't complain too much!",83066,4
83067,"They do stretch a bit more than expected, very comfortable.",83067,4
83067,A tad loose by the end of the day.,83067,4
83068,Nice all around trousers.,83068,4
83069,"It looks very nice, but I find it too thick and way too heavy for my taste.",83069,4
83069,"Nothing wrong with the ring at all, just not my preference.",83069,4
83070,I've traveled on Spirit Airlines with it and it does pass for a carry on.,83070,4
83070,Pros: You can cram a LOT of stuff in this bag.,83070,4
83070,"If you don't fill it entirely, you can squish it down so it doesn't take up as much space.",83070,4
83070,Cons: It's pretty low quality.,83070,4
83070,Wheels are a little awkward to maneuver without the swivel feature.,83070,4
83070,"I don't travel very often, so this bag is perfect.",83070,4
83071,Nice I like it so far I haven't tried it on yet but will let you know,83071,4
83072,My son saw this online and he had to have it!!!,83072,4
83072,"Product arrived on time, and looked as described.",83072,4
83072,"Works well, it has some cool lights that every 4yo would enjoy.",83072,4
83072,The only thing I don't love is that the background picture is a little dark,83072,4
83073,"Pros: slim, secure, enough spaces to hold necessary cards and ID, beautiful color, fits easily inside my clutch purse and pockets

Con: does not have an attached or removable key ring

I have been using this wallet for over a week and am very happy with the quality and design.",83073,4
83073,"It holds exactly the amount of cards, ID and other stuff easily.",83073,4
83074,"He loves this hat, it is not adjustable which would be nice since he had a Mohawk but he still fits it on his head!",83074,4
83075,"Somewhat small, but really cute.",83075,4
83076,I really love these however I found that they fit a bit small.,83076,4
83076,"I got a 6.5 and should have went with a 7, even though I typically wear a 6.5.",83076,4
83078,"So easy to slip into and comfy, and the shape is generally nice & trim.",83078,4
83078,"I feel like proportionate to the hips, the WAIST is quite large, though, and if I lose any weight the waist will probably pouch/gap some at the top and may look bulky under untucked blouses...",83078,4
83078,"I'm 5' 3"", 128 lbs., 38.5"" hips, and ordered M. This fit feels true-to-size to me.",83078,4
83078,"I originally ordered it in a beige color but actually am returning this for black instead, because I feel that in a light color the pencil shape is just a little too hip-hugging and revealing.",83078,4
83078,In black it will be perfect.,83078,4
83078,I have another Rekucci pencil skirt as well (denim) and overall I'm impressed with their products.,83078,4
83079,Great swimsuit for the money.,83079,4
83079,I'm 5-4 and weigh 125 pounds.,83079,4
83079,Ordered a M. The bikini fit perfect.,83079,4
83079,The tankini top is quite large and puckers a bit in the back.,83079,4
83079,Still great buy and love it.,83079,4
83080,Typically wears boys size 5 shoes,83080,4
83081,This was so perfect!,83081,4
83081,I ordered two different kimonos (the beige/pinkish-tan and the black one) and they fit just like I hoped they would.,83081,4
83081,"I'm 5'3, 145 lbs and I ordered them both size M. They give you a very beachy-casual look on top of whatever you wear.",83081,4
83081,They are a bit sheer and the fabric doesn't exactly feel like a baby's butt on your skin but I don't really mind it since I wear it on top of other fabric and I haven't tried using it at the beach yet.,83081,4
83081,The first day I used it I had yoga pants on and a tank top and that alone made me look very delicate and summer-y.,83081,4
83081,"The vibrant colors are amazing, and makes it possible to match it with anything.",83081,4
83081,The second time I used it I went on a date with my boyfriend and  I had two of the waitresses at the restaurant tell me my outfit looked super cute!,83081,4
83082,"Other than taking a long time to get here, my grand daughter absolutely LOVED it!",83082,4
83082,Well made piece but she already broke the chain.,83082,4
83083,"It's big, and good quality.",83083,4
83083,Not to mention I LOVE the style.,83083,4
83083,"It's got a  couple pockets inside, and a zip close.",83083,4
83083,"The only things I wish were slightly different, is a more stiff back, so it stands up straight on its own a little better.",83083,4
83083,And slightly longer straps so I could fit it over my shoulder a little better.,83083,4
83083,I have big shoulders though so I'm not sure this would be an issue for most.,83083,4
83083,But it's a great purchase regardless.,83083,4
83084,"Cheap metal in the necklace part, so replace that if you don't want metal poisoning.",83084,4
83084,"Cool functioning stopwatch, got it for my girlfriend on Valentines day, as she's a Fallout fan.",83084,4
83085,"Its cute for the price, its a very chunky piece, but cute!",83085,4
83086,Little bit see-through when I bend over but not bad at all.,83086,4
83086,They look super awesome on.,83086,4
83086,"I did expect them to be a shinier material, they are cotton.",83086,4
83086,The hidden pocket holds my car key nicely and I got a compliment from my spin instructor the first day I wore them.,83086,4
83087,They showed up when they said they would.,83087,4
83088,I am 5'7 115 lb.,83088,4
83088,it's a great quality swimsuit but for short body type.,83088,4
83088,as it was mentioned in the other reviews boobs are on the tummy .,83088,4
83088,gave it to my friend.,83088,4
83088,service was great and came earlier then i expected.,83088,4
83091,I like this top but if you aren't comfortable wear really short crop tops i wouldnt get it.,83091,4
83091,"But other than the length, its a good buy.",83091,4
83092,"These run small but for what I need them for they will work..  they are exactly as pictured, the design is very cool",83092,4
83093,Mechanical drift is acceptable so you have to adjust the big hand occasionally.,83093,4
83093,You will need to go to a jeweler to get band adjustments.,83093,4
83093,Most department stores will not adjust the band.,83093,4
83094,The fabric was nice and thick although the skirt is a different fabric then the leggings .,83094,4
83094,I ordered a 3XL and normally wear a size 16 .,83094,4
83094,They fit but a little weird,83094,4
83095,Unfortunately I ordered it too large and had to return it.,83095,4
83097,Excellent looking western style belt.,83097,4
83097,Attractive buckle and details and quality.,83097,4
83097,"Would have given it 5 stars, but seems to run a little small when comparing to the same size to other same size belts.",83097,4
83098,After receiving a different dress from the one I purchased they sent me the correct one and it is lovely.,83098,4
83098,Belt came with it.,83098,4
83098,Material on the bottom half is quite thin but very flowy and top part fit quite well.,83098,4
83099,"Slightly see-through/thinner material than I expected, but I love it!",83099,4
83099,It fits and looks great!,83099,4
83100,"A little on the thin side, but otherwise it is a cute shirt.",83100,4
83101,My 9 year old son picked these out and bought them with his own money and loves them.,83101,4
83101,I try and discourage him from wearing them outdoors a lot since they are on indoor soccer shoes and he plays so hard outside that he tears his other shoes up.,83101,4
83101,Hopefully these will last!,83101,4
83101,They look really cool!,83101,4
83102,"I'm usually small size but I had to order medium, that size fit me correctly.",83102,4
83103,"FYI for those who didn't notice, like me, the whole thing is made of spandex.",83103,4
83103,"I'm 5'1 and 135 pounds and it fit me just fine, could even stretch more.",83103,4
83103,It's good for the price.,83103,4
83104,These are great but they do ride up a bit so if that will bug you while you're working out then don't get them.,83104,4
83104,"Also, I would suggest going a size up just for comfort but that's my preference.",83104,4
83105,I loved the color and design of the bag.,83105,4
83105,I ordered it for my daughter for her birthday.,83105,4
83105,"She carried it for 12 days with a wallet, a calendar, a few pens and her car keys inside.",83105,4
83105,The lining by the inside zipper compartment ripped apart and is frayed.,83105,4
83105,I am very disappointed with the product.,83105,4
83105,For what I paid for this product it should have lasted more than 12 days.,83105,4
83105,I am happy to say that I was offered a refund and had the refund immediately.,83105,4
83105,I am very pleased and will be placing another order with this company very soon.,83105,4
83106,My daughter loved them they were a birthday gift.,83106,4
83106,The only thing they were a little long but only a problem if you are ordering for someone younger a smaller child.,83106,4
83108,"It is good, just a bit on the large size.",83108,4
83109,The reviews made me very worried about this shirt.,83109,4
83109,"I ordered a size small and worried it wouldn't fit, but when it came, it fit perfectly.",83109,4
83110,The picture doesn't give the true color--silver and black.,83110,4
83110,Good belt but not quite what I wanted.,83110,4
83110,I'm using for different jeans than I intended,83110,4
83112,"These attractive pants have pockets, which is very nice, but they seem to be made for very tall skinny people.",83112,4
83112,"That's not me, but I love zebra prints so I bought them anyway.",83112,4
83112,It's a good thing I ordered a size up because the waist would have been too small.,83112,4
83112,They are at least five inches too long.,83112,4
83112,"I am 5 4 1/2"" tall.",83112,4
83112,"I haven't actually worn these yet, so I will post an update when I do.",83112,4
83112,"UPDATE: Now that I have actually worn these, I regret buying them.",83112,4
83112,"The fabric is quite thin and the seams do not appear to be very well constructed - looks they are pulling apart already although the fit is very baggy, not tight at all.",83112,4
83112,"I had to buy a size up for the waist, but still these pants are HUGE and WAY TOO LONG!",83112,4
83113,The top fits as a small but the skirt is bigger,83113,4
83114,arms 2 small but nice dress,83114,4
83115,I ordered a size up for my husband and they fit a tad loose which is comfortable for him.,83115,4
83116,Great seller..love the colors but it runs extremely small..wear a 10 and an xl did not fit.,83116,4
83118,Great for working long hours in triple digit heat.,83118,4
83118,"The material is very light, breathable and durable.",83118,4
83119,I purchased this for my daughter to use as part of a minion girls costume.,83119,4
83119,I have always preferred to make or put together Halloween costumes instead of purchasing a store costume.,83119,4
83119,The color was true and it definitely matched the minion yellow!,83119,4
83119,It worked great and kept her warm on a chilly trick or treat night.,83119,4
83119,The fit was slightly small though expected for a baby/toddler hat...and my daughter has a large head at two and half years old so maybe it is that her head is big instead of the hat running slightly small.,83119,4
83120,I ordered a 3xl and got a 4xl.,83120,4
83120,The shirt is excellent though.,83120,4
83121,Fits great and made with good material.,83121,4
83121,Would order from them again.,83121,4
83122,"Very beautiful dress, but it is pretty short.",83122,4
83122,I am 5-1 and it did not even come to my knees.,83122,4
83122,Also the bottom layer would ride up and I was constantly pulling it down.,83122,4
83123,"I haven't heard anything bad form the giftee, will edit if I hear anything.",83123,4
83123,She likes them so far.,83123,4
83124,"Very nice, some of the buttons were starting to fall off but the dress is beautiful!",83124,4
83125,Wore these a couple of times and they seemed to hold my earrings in place well.,83125,4
83125,Its size is smaller than I expected but it did its job.,83125,4
83125,I ordered the sterling silver backs and am using them for my J-hoop diamond earrings in 14K white gold.,83125,4
83126,"Tiny little necklace, it's cute though, but be aware of the size, it seems bigger on the pictures.",83126,4
83127,I like this top because the material isn't thin.,83127,4
83127,Good quality for the money.,83127,4
83128,I Ordered a matching set for my kids (17 months and 4.5 years) for Christmas.,83128,4
83128,They're really comfy and perfect for Southern California 'winter'.,83128,4
83128,"My 17 month old is between 18 month size and 2 T. These are a little long on her, which is totally fine.",83128,4
83128,But the 5T I ordered for my 4.5 year old are just shy of too short.,83128,4
83128,She won't get much use out of them before they're too small.,83128,4
83129,I usual wear  4-6 I'm 5'5 and 156 lbs.,83129,4
83130,So of course I'm not small enough for this but it fits my Asian mom just right.,83130,4
83130,She said its so very comfortable.,83130,4
83130,"Now this sucks for me because yes we have both gotten bigger and I'm trying to find comfortable clothes for me to wear at a reasonable price, but they don't fit right and they for her.",83130,4
83130,"This style of clothing, the one that catches my eye is expensive but you can see that its made bigger.",83130,4
83130,"But for this one, the material is very soft, and flowy to feel.",83130,4
83130,I just had issues with my chest area in this dress so I couldn't wear it comfortably.,83130,4
83131,Sizes are to small,83131,4
83132,"Barely fits, but I'll make do.",83132,4
83132,Wouldn't trust the review that they run big-forget it,83132,4
83133,I purchased this as a gift.,83133,4
83133,It looks sharp and is very compact.,83133,4
83134,For the price it is actually a very good mask putting it on it fits so well and is very scary,83134,4
83135,The toe box is narrow and fit tight.,83135,4
83135,"My daughter was bummed because they were ""sparkly and cool"" .",83135,4
83135,Had to return them:(,83135,4
83137,"My now ex-girlfriend loves them, I mean she took them with her.",83137,4
83137,Nothing wrong with the item itself that's just life.,83137,4
83138,They do run a bit large but not terribly so.,83138,4
83138,My daughter wears a 1 in all other shoes and these are 13's and they are just a bit too big.,83138,4
83138,My daughter hasn't worn them but for a few minutes so I can't speak to how comfortable they will be or how well the sparkles will hold up but initially they seem pretty decent.,83138,4
83139,"runs small, but is cute.",83139,4
83140,"Great Quality, very pleased, but a little too long.",83140,4
83140,"It wasn't t-length, it was more like ankle length.",83140,4
83141,He's run a little small but overall good product,83141,4
83143,"The wallet is beautiful, unfortunately the coin section zipper ripped right away and the credit card holders also ripped.",83143,4
83144,A little more translucent than I would like but... overall happy w/the purchase,83144,4
83145,"A little loose, would have to pull up constantly.",83145,4
83145,Size runs a little big as well.,83145,4
83145,Normally wear a 6.5 but felt like a 7.,83145,4
83145,Otherwise very nice boots for the price.,83145,4
83146,My daughter is pleased with these cleats.,83146,4
83146,They do turn her feet blue when the field conditions are slightly wet from morning dew.,83146,4
83146,These cleats have fabric at the heel which is awesome for my daughter who gets horrible blisters if it is plastic/leather there which many cleats have.,83146,4
83146,I ordered 2 pairs so she will grow right into the next pair.,83146,4
83146,"Edit 10/26/2016 - these shoes have been great, the toe area just ripped open.",83146,4
83146,"I was disappointed but my husband pointed out the level of wear (8-9 hours of practice a week, plus games).",83146,4
83146,Good product and good price.,83146,4
83148,A nice product and correct fitting.,83148,4
83149,Dishonored makes it look like you have a couch but it is definitely good under underwear,83149,4
83150,It's okay and I'm making it work but it doesn't fit as loose as on the model........a tad more tight,83150,4
83151,"Love the product, material is nice but fragile.",83151,4
83152,"Of course, as expected at such a low price, the chain is poor quality and won't look great for long but I don't regret my purchase since the price is so low.",83152,4
83152,Shipping takes forever but it's worth the wait.,83152,4
83153,Happy with this product.,83153,4
83154,These are a good length and pretty light.,83154,4
83154,The only thing I didn't like is that I had to twist them a bit to make the wings left and right.,83154,4
83154,I hate to do operations on new jewelry but it was a pretty quick fix.,83154,4
83154,Hopefully I didn't screw them up or weaken the links.,83154,4
83155,I had to return it because I'm too small chested.,83155,4
83155,It looked great on my big hips.,83155,4
83155,Anyone that has both would look great in this dress,83155,4
83156,It's too large but nice.,83156,4
83156,I would like a smaller size.,83156,4
83156,"Do not care for the blue ""fur"" which is not detachable.",83156,4
83157,Overall I like this.,83157,4
83157,"Good size, manipulates well.",83157,4
83157,I wish the leather was softer.,83157,4
83158,really love this swimsuit :) the bottoms are a little small but it's not because of the seller!,83158,4
83158,I should have ordered a bigger size): the sizes are true !,83158,4
83158,"I love this swimsuit so much, the good really looks good and makes me look super tan :) love it:) also, people say the bottoms look like a diaper but I didn't really have a problem with that..",83158,4
83158,I think they make my butt look nice:),83158,4
83159,Good for every day.,83159,4
83161,Broken when was worn once.,83161,4
83162,not unless you're in desert heat!,83162,4
83162,Wear it with just what the model is wearing.,83162,4
83163,These glasses have solid protection from sunlight and I have had many compliments on wearing them.,83163,4
83163,The only problem was the left ear rubber  sliding off.,83163,4
83163,Great glasses for the value.,83163,4
83164,Warm and just the right size,83164,4
83165,I usually wear a medium and ordered a large and fits just right.,83165,4

83167,It was just a bit too small for me.,83167,4
83167,But its a very nice good quality bag.,83167,4
83169,"I have a very small baby and the fit was a little small on him, so they seem to run a little small.",83169,4
83169,Especially the neck opening.,83169,4
83169,My son was 6 months at the time he wore it and I purchased the 6 month size.,83169,4
83169,I would definitely size up.,83169,4
83169,"Other than the size, it's a very cute and comfy shirt!",83169,4
83169,"Nice soft fabric, and seems well made.",83169,4
83170,Nice quality with embroidered detail that was accurate!,83170,4

83173,"Fast shipment for being shipped from China and its worth the money looks authentic, I recommend it!",83173,4
83176,The items look just like the ones in the picture.,83176,4
83176,They are nice and fit well.,83176,4
83177,"They even arrived early, they are slightly see through up close so I suggest wearing black or white undies.",83177,4
83177,I'm a 14-16 american and have a little space in these.,83177,4
83178,"These are great quality just run small, will need to exchange for a larger size",83178,4
83179,Pretty happy with it.,83179,4
83179,I wish it was thicker and wish the hinges didn't have as much play from side to side.,83179,4
83180,"casual sweater, slightly big, but if that's the look someone is looking for then it will work.",83180,4
83180,"Be aware this sweater is made out of mixed fibers so it is not the greatest in quality, but works for casual wear.",83180,4
83181,great gag gift for people who don't like wearing seat belts.,83181,4
83182,"Fits everything I need for the day, snacks, breakfast, and sometimes two lunches.",83182,4
83184,I'm usually a size 0 depending on clothing brands and a size 4 in swim brands.,83184,4
83184,The top fits as expected.,83184,4
83184,But the bottom is hella small!,83184,4
83184,The leg holes cut into my thighs.,83184,4
83184,I'm getting it altered to fit more comfortably.,83184,4
83184,This would cause major chafing on the inner thighs if you were to swim for a long time.,83184,4
83185,I get comments on it all the time.,83185,4
83185,It seemed a bit tighter than most large shirts.,83185,4
83185,Enough to where I'm afraid to machine dry it.,83185,4
83185,Maybe that's a sign that I need to lose some weight hah ha.,83185,4
83186,Alot more daintier then they look,83186,4
83187,I purchased two of these watches in different colors for my children.,83187,4
83187,I'm working on teaching them to read time so these are perfect for little children.,83187,4
83187,They have a very clear dial & an adjustable watchband.,83187,4
83187,Another great feature is they also have a second hand on the watch which is great for timing them while they brush their teeth.,83187,4
83187,Overall my children & myself are very happy with these watches.,83187,4
83188,So far so good!,83188,4
83188,I have stacked it with other rings and it looks good.,83188,4
83188,I have another Tungsten ring and I love it!,83188,4
83188,I am a fan of them.,83188,4
83189,"comfortable, and classy cocktail dress casual dress the tummy control is not too tight but you can adjust the length",83189,4
83190,My only complaint is that it is a little too long and I end up stepping on it.,83190,4
83190,"I am 5'7"" so that is not a common concern for me.",83190,4
83193,This dress is as cute in person as it is online.,83193,4
83193,Only issue we had with it is that it is a little long on my daughter.,83193,4
83193,So needless to say we won't be needing tights to go under it for some time.,83193,4
83193,But over all very good for the price.,83193,4
83194,She wears it after swim practice,83194,4
83195,Very pretty but a little too big for me.,83195,4
83195,Fast transaction and good to deal with.,83195,4
83196,"Very cute, but run large.",83196,4
83197,"Very nice looking belt, but I'm a little concerned how well the plastic strip that the ratchet engages will hold up.",83197,4
83198,Larger than I expected but still nice.,83198,4
83198,"I could have sworn I ordered just a purse and not a ""large"" purse but I guessed that happens when you order haphazardly in the middle of the night after a glass or two.",83198,4
83198,I will still use the purse cuz it's still nice and a good value.,83198,4
83199,It sometimes gets caught in my hair and needs a little getting use too but is a great product for the price.,83199,4
83200,"The bracelet looks great, but some of the joints do not move freely.",83200,4
83201,Nice colors pink ribbon is a little smaller than I imagined,83201,4
83202,Lovely & looks exactly like the photo!,83202,4
83202,I wish I had ordered a size up but it still works out.,83202,4
83202,I'm normally a US size medium (36 bust) I ordered a size 12 and I can close it around myself but I would rather have a size bigger since I wanted this too be big and roomy.,83202,4
83202,If I had ordered a size down from the 12 it would be too small & I wouldn't be able to wear it!,83202,4
83202,So if in doubt I would say size up.,83202,4
83203,I am only giving them four stars because they are only a few days old.,83203,4
83203,The earrings were a gift for my fiance..his birthstone color.,83203,4
83203,They looked very nice on him.,83203,4
83203,The 6MM size is just the right without being to gaudy or over sized for a male!,83203,4
83203,The quality of the earring thus far is very good.,83203,4
83203,"He has only had them on for a few days...will update if they become discolored, etc.",83203,4
83203,They are true in color...they are very nice earrings for the price!,83203,4
83203,"If all goes well, I will order from this seller again.",83203,4
83205,Beautiful dress that is a nice weight!,83205,4
83205,It flows perfectly and is very figure flattering.,83205,4
83205,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my dress arrived with two small dirt spots.,83205,4
83207,Small which I suppose should be expected.,83207,4
83207,Otherwise they seem good.,83207,4
83208,I just don't understand how to work the back clasp!,83208,4
83209,"The writing is stamped better in,some areas than others",83209,4
83210,"Well made, good organizer",83210,4
83211,"I'm not sure if it's the color or the quality of the dress that I have a problem with, but it just doesn't look that great on me.",83211,4
83211,I gave it 4 stars because it does look exactly like the photo.,83211,4
83211,The material was pretty good too.,83211,4
83212,nice for the price and pants haven't fallen once,83212,4
83213,"Too thick, but decent looking.",83213,4
83214,"The Inside Out characters are prominently displayed, which is good because they hide the random car and rocket in the background...",83214,4
83215,Well built and pretty ring.,83215,4
83215,The only thing I would watch out for would be that it does have 7 stones and so the side two stones will be in contact with your other fingers.,83215,4
83215,This irritates me and I find myself turning the ring over during the day but if you are not quite so fidgety as I am it may not be a problem.,83215,4
83216,Thanks you  I really like it..,83216,4
83217,Absolutely love this hoody!,83217,4
83217,"Really keeps you warm, and was thicker than expected.",83217,4
83217,The only reason i give 4 stars and not 5 is because of the strings and the weird button.,83217,4
83217,"The strings are WAY to long, like down to the pockets long, so i'll be tying them up somehow.",83217,4
83217,"The button closure is a little awkward, but should get used to it with practice.",83217,4
83217,Otherwise im happy :),83217,4
83219,I love the dress overall but it's a tad too small in my back area,83219,4
83220,These undies are super soft and comfortable.,83220,4
83220,The one star deduction is because after just a few washes I noticed the color has left in spots.,83220,4
83220,"I do not use, nor even own bleach, so it's not accidental bleaching.",83220,4
83220,"I do use Borax in my wash, never had a problem with that though.",83220,4
83220,"The fabric is still as new, just the color is washed out in splotches.",83220,4
83220,"I also bought black DA trunks at the same time as these, they are fine...and have been washed together with these every time.",83220,4
83221,"They're great plugs, nice quality, but more yellowish with blue than the opaque/white I was hoping they'd be.",83221,4
83222,"The white choker had a small stain in the back, but it was really tiny so I guess it's alright since it was also on the back.",83222,4
83222,"Overall, the product is pretty good.",83222,4
83222,I'm wearing the black one today!,83222,4
83222,"They look just they way it looks on the image, so the purple one isn't pastel if you're looking into getting a pastel choker!",83222,4
83223,Fits me perfectly across the shoulders and down to my waist.,83223,4
83223,I love the Logo and the quality.,83223,4
83223,There's something about the Legion that still holds sway to this day.,83223,4
83223,"Anyway, great quality from CafePress.",83223,4
83223,Safe bet with your money.,83223,4
83224,XXL feel like a USA medium.,83224,4
83224,"Not to warm, not too light.",83224,4
83224,I can wear it all day long.,83224,4
83225,I little small on the lower part but ok,83225,4
83228,it was a perfect fit I am a bridesmaid in my sisters wedding and her colors are purple I love the way it fits I would definitely recommend y'all to my friends,83228,4
83229,"So, to start this off...",83229,4
83229,I mentioned in another review that i am a teacher and my school's colors are purple and gold... when looking for spirit wear for the days we are allowed to do dress up...,83229,4
83229,I will check out everything that has purple in it as a possible costume accent.,83229,4
83229,So when i see purple tights and these are available in a plus size... well of course i would try em.,83229,4
83229,"They fit, were not too snug on the thighs or calves (for a man's form) and I was able to wear them for our school parade without issue.",83229,4
83229,No tears or runs... a solid pair of tights that will be kept in my tote of costumes for future spirit wear outfits.,83229,4
83230,"Overall, I was happy with the product.",83230,4
83230,"However, as others mentioned, the sequins can get pretty itchy if you are not wearing something underneath.",83230,4
83230,"Also, the sequins are a lot brighter in person than in the picture.",83230,4
83230,Be prepared to draw some attention!,83230,4
83230,The quality of the shirt is good.,83230,4
83230,I didn't notice any strings hanging out or snares in the fabric.,83230,4
83230,"While the color is black, the material has some other colors infused in it, giving it more of a metallic look.",83230,4
83230,The fit is very forgiving and this type of shirt looks really nice over skinny jeans.,83230,4
83230,I wore it over silver ones and it matched perfectly.,83230,4
83230,"Also, the length of it is great because it does not ride up or show skin when bending forward.",83230,4
83230,The shirt can be worn during the day or even for a night out.,83230,4
83231,"As others have mentioned the sleeves are long, works for us as we all have long arms.",83231,4
83231,"Very soft inside, my son wants to wear it constantly.",83231,4
83232,I liked it because it met my expectations.,83232,4
83233,I love this show and I love this shirt it is so comfy I would wear it all day if I could,83233,4
83235,Rather larger but I like it.,83235,4
83236,had a difficult time finding a winter hat that looked right with my short hair.,83236,4
83236,this hat is great.,83236,4
83236,soft & fits well.,83236,4
83236,love the burgundy color with my grey hair.,83236,4
83237,My only issue is the hat was shipped in a box that was too small.,83237,4
83237,The hat was shipped crushed  and deformed.,83237,4
83239,This is perfect for holding my cards.,83239,4
83239,will be buying more things from this company,83239,4
83241,"No where near as  colorful as the photo pictured, but  <sigh> it serves its purpose well.",83241,4
83241,Work  ID holder.,83241,4
83242,I am NOT a fan of Guide Gear because they just don't seem to be well made and the sizes can vary even on the same number.,83242,4
83242,However they did and do fit so I will go with 4 stars not for that but because they are Flannel Lined which saves this brand from total disappointment.,83242,4
83243,I'm not a hat person but needed something to wear after taking off the motorcycle helmet.,83243,4
83243,:)  It's pretty and I love the colors.,83243,4
83244,"Great price, comfortable and cute.",83244,4
83245,"Very comfortable over the ears, and very warm.",83245,4
83245,"However, the fit could be more snug.",83245,4
83245,It may fit better after washing.,83245,4
83245,"Great color also, good purchase.",83245,4
83246,A very feminine dress.,83246,4
83246,A nice material and good quality.,83246,4
83246,It was a bit wrinkled when I received it but I pressed it on a lower heat setting and it was fine.,83246,4
83247,"I was not sure if I was going to like these briefs, but they are realy  comfortable.",83247,4
83247,"It took a few times wearing then to get used to the pocket in front, but once I did I like them so much I ordered any 2 pair.",83247,4
83248,The material is very sheer yet soft and comfortable.,83248,4
83248,Not too bad for the prize.,83248,4
83249,I love the dress and its comfortable.,83249,4
83249,Size was very nice fit.,83249,4
83249,I picked size 12-14.,83249,4
83250,"It's very cute, I love the design.",83250,4
83250,good quality and fast shipping.,83250,4
83250,"It was large on me, didn't fit closely around my jawline, but I do have a narrow face.",83250,4
83251,Perfect if you don't want to overdo the turkey theme.,83251,4
83252,The bag it's smaller than expected but I feel as if the overall quality is extremely nice.,83252,4
83252,I purchased a bag to hold my laptop and other things I need for class.,83252,4
83252,"It's a little on the small side I can fit my surface pro (with out carry case) and other objects or you can keep in my purse, but I do wish you with a hair bigger.",83252,4
83252,I wouldn't recommend it for a book bag if you plan to carry bulky textbooks or items.,83252,4
83252,"However, if you plan on carrying light items it should be fine.",83252,4
83252,Got a few compliments on my first day wearing bag.,83252,4
83253,My son looked very handsome for his prom.,83253,4
83254,This is a nice tube top.,83254,4
83254,It is made of nylon and I would like to have a cotton one as they are more comfortable in our humid weather.,83254,4
83254,I'm not sure the one size would fit a large person.,83254,4
83254,"Overall, it's nice though.",83254,4
83255,Bought this for my 4 year old and its HUGE but I don't mind.,83255,4
83255,Still adorable and the extra fluff will be extra insulation.,83255,4
83255,"Not sure how this would wash, seems like it would pill up so we will keep it out of the snow.",83255,4
83256,Fits as well as I expected it to fit.,83256,4
83256,"Brim is just the right width for both sun protection and, later this year, rain protection.",83256,4
83256,Very satisfied with the purchase.,83256,4
83256,"A plus, I was able to find what I was looking for in a Stetson, which are made in the USA.",83256,4
83257,this is a really cute swim suit.,83257,4
83257,i have a little more junk in the trunk so the bottoms ended up looking like a thong almost.,83257,4
83257,other that that the fit was pretty good..,83257,4
83258,It was the perfect fit,83258,4
83259,This dress turned out great for a bridesmaid dress!,83259,4
83259,"A little longer than I would have liked, however.. it was a quick and cheap trip to the sewing shop and it fit me perfectly.",83259,4
83259,"Quality fabric, I would buy again.",83259,4
83259,Color was as pictured on Amazon also.,83259,4
83260,Much darker gray than shown in the picture.,83260,4
83260,"I thought this would go well with my daughter's turquoise bathing suit, but the gray is darker, and doesn't look fresh and light like the picture at all.",83260,4
83260,"We've still worn it a few times because it's convenient, but I tend to opt for another hat.",83260,4
83260,"Besides the surprise color, the hat is great.",83260,4
83260,"I got size 9-18 months, and it's a little large for my 12 month old (55% in head size), so the cinch comes in handy.",83260,4
83260,She actually fits better in a size smaller iplay hat.,83260,4
83261,Make sure you wash it before you wear it.,83261,4
83261,The dye isn't set.,83261,4
83261,I pulled it out of the bag to check it out and my finger tips turned blue.,83261,4
83261,Once it gets washed and dry for the first time the jumper will be fine to wear.,83261,4
83262,Was a gift and they loved it!,83262,4
83263,Very well made and very cheap,83263,4
83264,smaller than what I thought,83264,4
83265,"It was a nice skirt, it didn't flare like i anticipated so i returned it",83265,4
83266,Love the size and color and just about everything.,83266,4
83266,"But it broke after to flights, cracked all the way across the bottom.",83266,4
83266,"I know that sometimes the airlines are rough with baggage, but that is exactly why I got a hard case to begin with.",83266,4
83266,I taped it up and still use it though.,83266,4
83269,This shirt is so cute!,83269,4
83269,"The material is kind of thing, but perfect for summer or for honeymoon!",83269,4
83271,Looks just like the photo.,83271,4
83271,"Fits slightly small, but generally a good buy, particularly for the price!",83271,4
83271,"Fabric seems durable enough, although it is not heavy winter fabric.",83271,4
83271,"Warm enough, but definitely more of a light jacket than a thick winter piece.",83271,4
83271,Only downside is no pockets!,83271,4
83272,cute socks and my grandson loves them.,83272,4
83272,They are a little slippery on the bottom when worn on wood floors but others I would recommend.,83272,4
83273,"So far, good for the price.",83273,4
83273,"In European size, I'd take exactly a 42.5, which they do not make.",83273,4
83273,"Therefore, I went with the 43, which is slightly too large - better than getting my toes mashed.",83273,4
83273,Fair Quality for the price; I feel they are a good way to check out whether you want to go clipless on an mtb w/o too much investment.,83273,4
83273,"The average investment would be around $40-50 for entry level clipless pedals, and $70-80, quickly going up, for mtb clipless shoes - $110-130 minimum in total.",83273,4
83273,I bought these for $80.,83273,4
83273,"The pedals are working fine, but take some adjustment out of the box, and some getting used to.",83273,4
83273,"I'd reccomend searching youtube for clipless mtb pedals to learn how to adjust them, as well as get in and out of them.",83273,4
83273,"It also takes practice ;-), but not too much once you get it.",83273,4
83274,Seems well made but didn't look right with my figure.,83274,4
83275,Hat provided a stylish sun shade for summer outings.,83275,4
83276,"He liked the hoodie and I ordered an XL which is the size he wears, but the hoodie was not the right fit.",83276,4
83276,It said it was an XL  but the fit was more a large than an extra large.,83276,4
83276,He has decided to either give it away or lose some weight.,83276,4
83277,"I bought a size up after reading reviews, and it fits fine.",83277,4
83277,The material is thin as others reviewers have mentioned.,83277,4
83277,"That said, I live in Florida so it will work for me.",83277,4
83278,really great shipping time!,83278,4
83278,"they are somewhat see thew tho, there not really plus sized, so beware!",83278,4
83278,i got them for me but fit my daughter,83278,4
83279,Dry clean only is a downside on a cheap dress that'll outweigh the cost quickly.,83279,4
83280,They look good and are cute.,83280,4
83280,Just fit slightly smaller than expected.,83280,4
83281,I love everything about this dress for being pregnant except 1 thing!!!,83281,4
83281,They do not compensate on the top...at all!!,83281,4
83281,"The dress is long enough and flows great, but I have to wear an extra tank underneath it to keep the girls in place.",83281,4
83281,Other than that I completely recommend!,83281,4
83282,"I was so worried that the quality of this would be poor, however it is not bad for the price at all..I order an 18 even though I wear a 14, because I wanted the pant to flow and not fit tightly on my hips..I am pear shaped .",83282,4
83282,"It arrived pretty quickly, the quality of the material is not too cheap looking and the bottom fit as I wanted, the top however is too big..not much of an issue though, since it can be easily altered...I would recommend",83282,4
83284,Everything fit except the sleeves are extremely long...,83284,4
83285,This is not a small charm it is fairly large and heavy but is very beautiful.,83285,4
83286,I really like the necklace.,83286,4
83286,The chain is a bit narrow for the G but I do really like it!,83286,4
83287,"Great quality, color is exactly as the picture shows.",83287,4
83287,"The only issue is the dress is a little to big; therefore, I had to have it altered, which cost me $79 because of the beading.",83287,4
83288,Bright color very comfy as a women who is top heavy I worry about buying shirts on line but this fit good.,83288,4
83289,I have like for it to be longer,83289,4
83290,"Came pretty waded up & wrinkled...cute...I ordered the very largest size...
and it's still small for what I'd consider as Lg, that I usually buy in a store.",83290,4
83290,It's cute tho..would be a good swimsuit coverup.,83290,4
83291,"Very pretty and well made, but, for a petite 11 year old it looked a bit big.",83291,4
83292,"I really like this product, my only critique is that the pockets are shallow and the hood is short but other then that i love it",83292,4
83293,"A little short, comes a few inches above my ankles (I'm 5'10"" though so not uncommon), but still comfy and pretty!",83293,4
83294,Got this robe for my 8 year old son (after he picked it himself on Amazon).,83294,4
83294,It is soft and cozy and had no apparent flaws.,83294,4
83294,I was a bit nervous after reading a few of the reviews where people found holes or pulled strings.,83294,4
83294,"It feels pretty delicate and not the best quality, although it's fine for our purposes, and I haven't washed it yet, so I'll reserve a star until I see how it holds up in the washer/dryer.",83294,4
83294,It seems like it might not be the most resilient but we'll see.,83294,4
83294,"So far, I'm pleased.",83294,4
83295,This seems to be a good quality slip/dress.,83295,4
83295,It is opaque with nice lace trim and will work well for me as a long camisole.,83295,4
83295,"However, I am 5'10"" & it is way too short for a dress or slip for use with a dress.",83295,4
83295,I can pull it down over my rear because it's very dressy but when I walk it springs back up over my hips.,83295,4
83296,If larger hips go a size bigger otherwise shirt is nice.,83296,4
83296,Loner length is good for legging also.,83296,4
83296,Not see through drapes nicely,83296,4
83297,"Very pretty, and fits great.",83297,4
83297,"Very versatile as it pairs well with my jeans, dress pants, and my favorite thin strapped dress.",83297,4
83297,"Very light, but enough to keep the chill out in a cool venue,  being a restaurant or ballroom.",83297,4
83299,For a costume it was a hit.,83299,4
83299,"It was a bit large, but it still did the job.",83299,4
83299,It just required a few more bobby pins.,83299,4
83300,I love it but Im 5'1  and  even with heels  it was  a drag.,83300,4
83301,Cute but a bit flimsy.,83301,4
83301,It split into pieces when my daughter got it caught on her car seat belt.,83301,4
83301,But I fixed it.,83301,4
83302,This is one size fits all so you always have to make a few adjustments.,83302,4
83302,No complaints there; just tied the top in the back.,83302,4
83302,"Kind of cheap material, the panties tore a bit on the sides, but still wearable again.",83302,4
83302,Good set for the price!,83302,4
83303,But not easy to put on with it's clasp.,83303,4
83304,"Good product, I am size 6 at the waist and have a 34D bust size.",83304,4
83304,"I ordered a medium and the skirt fits perfectly, but the top was just a tad bit too small.",83304,4
83304,I feel as though if I ordered a large the skirt would just be too big but I can definitely improvise for the top.,83304,4
83305,The top was a little too big on me but the bottom fit just fine.,83305,4
83305,The top seems to bunch together in front when sitting.,83305,4
83305,"Otherwise good buy, washes well.",83305,4
83306,I bought the navy blue.,83306,4
83306,I was a little disappointed as I thought the flowers were a pale pink and they ended up being beige.,83306,4
83306,It's cute and was a good price.,83306,4
83308,I've gotten a few of these and they always fit my son a little too snug for my taste.,83308,4
83308,"They are nice, but I just wish they were made a little bit looser to give some breathing space especially around the arms and legs.",83308,4
83309,my tongue did get infected but i think it was because of after care.,83309,4
83309,it was only minor though,83309,4
83310,"Dress is really pretty, but way too big in the bust area.",83310,4
83310,I decided to order her regular size because she is just about to go into the next size up so no biggie of its a little big...wrong.,83310,4
83310,It fell off of her even when we had the back tied as tight as it would go.,83310,4
83310,I'll be returning this for an 8 and hopefully that works.,83310,4
83310,I really wish I would've listened to the other reviews and ordered a size down to begin with.,83310,4
83311,I really love my glasses they are awesome !,83311,4
83311,They are a little loose one the side but thanks !,83311,4
83312,"It fits somewhat small ,but it takes almost a month to come that the only disappointment",83312,4
83313,I read they run large and would agree they are roomy.,83313,4
83313,My boy has pudgy wide feet though and i would rather have them too big than too small.,83313,4
83313,We wore two pairs of socks and he will grow into them.,83313,4
83313,Velcro could be longer on the shoe base so that the strap doesnt stick out so far when tightened.,83313,4
83314,I just wore the dress today and got a compliment from my hubby and mom.,83314,4
83314,Definitely order 2 sizes above your usual size if you don't want a very tight fitting.,83314,4
83314,"I usually wear size small US but I ordered large as recommended by other reviewers and did not regret, I did.",83314,4
83314,I only give 4 stars because I have to cut some kind of strings hanging; the stitches are okay.,83314,4
83314,"Other than that, I'm satisfied with my order.",83314,4
83315,110 to 115 lbs.,83315,4

83318,"I am 5'5"" and 115lbs, normally wear a size XS or S in tops with a 30/32"" band size.",83318,4
83318,I ordered an Asia Medium/US Small and the fit is perfect.,83318,4
83318,"The fabric isn't great but for $4 I am not complaining, and don't mind the fabric at all.",83318,4
83319,The pins are a little difficult to push through clothing- the points seem to be blunted.,83319,4
83319,"But they work fine, so long as you are not wearing them on very delicate fabrics.",83319,4
83320,"i got a size small and it's just a touch on the large side, just past my butt.",83320,4
83320,it's very hard to find shirts for childfree people and i just love it.,83320,4
83321,Pre-pregnancy I was a size 14 so I ordered a size 3.,83321,4
83321,The fit is somewhat large but I expect to grow into it as I am currently only 20 weeks.,83321,4
83321,The band serves it's purpose and helps to extend my wardrobe without having to buy maternity clothes!,83321,4
83322,It was smaller than expected,83322,4
83323,The dress is a little big but it's really beautiful.,83323,4

83326,I would definitely order again from Girl Era!,83326,4

83328,Nicely slim and light weight.,83328,4
83328,Fits everything needed for travel easily.,83328,4
83328,Strap is perfect for having hands free.,83328,4

83332,Sturdy plastic replacement for wallet,83332,4
83333,"Ordered it a size up, the chest it a bit tight but I have a larger chest.",83333,4

83334,Great for my hourglass shape.,83334,4
83334,I'm a size 2X/22 but ordered a 3X.,83334,4
83334,Could have probably used a 4X but it's okay.,83334,4
83335,Wife loves it as it is to small for me.,83335,4
83335,"I bought an XL, it was tight, but after the wash it was a large.",83335,4
83335,"I am 6'2 and 240, usually an XL is perfect.",83335,4
83335,All GU clothing fit small.,83335,4
83336,The cups don't really have shape to them so it kind of lays on my boobs awkwardly (I'm a 32B) but besides that it's fine.,83336,4
83337,"Was as beatiful as the pic, and it fit.",83337,4
83340,"Nice shades, not very sophisticated, yet, its a nice everyday pair",83340,4
83342,just as expected just waiting for super cold arctic air to get in some good use this winter!,83342,4
83343,It is a darling costume set for my collection.,83343,4
83343,"The only thing for me is the necklace was a little bit too short, so I just use an extension.",83343,4
83343,I bought an assortment here on Amazon actually that can in white and yellow gold in several sizes.,83343,4
83343,I have gotten so much use out of that.,83343,4
83344,"Love these but this one is a little more reveling then the darker colors nothing that some ""Spanks"" won't fix.",83344,4
83344,Very comfortable and dressy enough for school.,83344,4
83345,OK FOR AROUND HOUSE,83345,4
83346,"Size runs small,  good material bright colors",83346,4
83347,It's a great-looking hat; came in a protective hat box in ideal shape; delivery was very prompt and timely; hat fits great out of the box.,83347,4
83347,I bought it for a golf hat and I haven't used it for that purpose yet.,83347,4
83347,"The hat band does not look substantial, but I'll check it out soon enough.",83347,4
83347,I'm excited and expecting good things from it.,83347,4
83347,I just hope it doesn't cramp my backswing,83347,4
83348,i loved the top fit perfectly but the bottoms unfortunelty were huge...i just paired it with regular black bottoms....sadly ended up growing out of top bottoms still don't fit.,83348,4
83349,Really hard to get in and out of by yourself!,83349,4
83349,Otherwise it looks great,83349,4
83350,the inside of the bracelet is a bit rough and is irritating at first but that goes away the more you wear it.,83350,4
83350,"Overall good product, great price.",83350,4
83351,The top is so padded.,83351,4
83351,I am keeping it but cutting out the padding.,83351,4
83353,It's a tunic so it hides my flat butt.,83353,4
83353,I am loving this brand!!!!!,83353,4
83353,The sleeves are a little short though.,83353,4
83354,"I have small hands but I put a photo up so you could get a better idea of the size

Like others posted, the posts were bent when I received them.",83354,4
83354,Luckily not broken though.,83354,4
83354,They are a deep red in person and don't have an orange tint like they do in the photos.,83354,4
83354,They have a good weight to them and look pretty.,83354,4
83354,Great size and good looking earrings.,83354,4
83354,Took 11 days from when I ordered to receiving my earrings.,83354,4
83354,Seller could put them in a box or extra padding something at least though so people don't received damaged goods.,83354,4
83354,Not like it's that expensive to wad up paper or put some styrofoam on the back of the earrings.,83354,4
83354,Won't buy again from this seller unless there is different packaging because it's too risky if you're on a tight timeframe like I was.,83354,4
83355,If only I had went a size up.,83355,4
83355,"Great price, Fairly quickly shipped.",83355,4
83355,Especially considering the price!,83355,4
83355,The peplum could have flaired a bit more.,83355,4
83355,"It hugs the correct way, Nice length etc.",83355,4
83355,Just order up a size.maybe even two.,83355,4
83355,Not so small that you can't make it work.,83355,4
83355,But small enough to want a little more wiggle room,83355,4
83356,"I was advised, both by the chart and a rep of hourglass, to order a medium.",83356,4
83356,"I am well aware of how things fit me so, I went against the advice and I ordered a small.",83356,4
83356,"There are 3 hooks on the cincher from side to side for flexibility...well, from day one my small easily went straight to the last and tightest hook.",83356,4
83356,"I wish, based off of my measurements that were given before purchase, there was someone that would have been able to give me accurate advice.",83356,4
83356,I would have been extremely disappointed to have received the medium to find out it was too big.,83356,4
83356,"Anywho, everybody's body is different.",83356,4
83356,"To be helpful I am 5'5"", 125lbs, waist 28.5, hips 35, breast size 34DD.",83356,4
83356,On the bright side it seems to be well made.,83356,4
83356,"You definitely smell like a tire when you have it on for more than 5 hours...but I am sure, based off of reviews, the smell will slowly fade away.",83356,4
83357,Nice for costume glasses.,83357,4
83359,"I got this to wear as an undershirt for my button down collar summer shirts, primarily for the white collar.",83359,4
83359,The collar on the Tee is so saggy and low cut you can't see it while wearing the button down over it.,83359,4
83361,The one from Dreams was at too long but I have had it fit to size.,83361,4
83362,"chain broke off after 1 week of use, its okay since i thought the chain looks a little cheapy but overall Im still satisfied with my purchase.",83362,4
83362,I get a lot of compliments on it,83362,4
83364,Fit well & it was a great price for the product.,83364,4
83364,It's a cute nightgown.,83364,4
83365,"They were super cute but the only complaint I have is that when I got them they had a little scratch on them and they kept slipping down my nose, oh well.",83365,4
83365,I still like them and they're perfect for my Black cosplay <3,83365,4
83366,The pantyhose appear to be standard quality.,83366,4
83366,"They are not thick like tights, but that is ok.",83366,4
83366,"The ball joints don't line up well on a slender 5'4"" teen.",83366,4
83366,If they are not worn with shorts they would probably have to be pulled up continually since they don't sit at the waist.,83366,4
83366,"So happy we didn't purchase at the local mall for $20 - considering the price we paid, we are happy with the product.",83366,4
83367,I like the style of the product,83367,4
83368,Very nice.except one size does not fit all.,83368,4
83368,We had to stretch them so they would fit my husband's hands...which are normal size for a man.,83368,4
83369,The belt portion fit well but the straps that were supposed to go around the thighs where a little too small.,83369,4
83369,I bought extra velcro to attach to extend it to fit it around the thigh like it was supposed to.,83369,4
83371,Lots of fun to wear.,83371,4
83371,No way to go to the bathroom without taking them off.,83371,4
83372,beautiful color as expected,83372,4
83374,The first one they sent was too big and the neck cut was wrong.,83374,4
83374,They sent me a replacement which is great.,83374,4
83374,Nice fit and I like how soft it feels.,83374,4
83374,A slight bit thin but good for the price.,83374,4
83374,I wear 1x to 2x size in USA sizes but bought 4x here and it fits very well.,83374,4
83374,This company honored their customer by making a wrong right.,83374,4
83375,"cute slippers, hard to tell it's a chick, though.",83375,4
83375,the orange beak stands straight up on your toes- which does look a little chick-ish.,83375,4
83375,"there are 2 wings on each side that drag on the floor, that I have to explain to everyone that it is part of the slipper and not broken",83375,4
83376,Shorter and width than the picture but beautiful and good quality anyway,83376,4
83377,Ordered this for my son's 5th birthday as he is currently obsessed with The Nutcracker.,83377,4
83377,It fits and he has room to grow into it.,83377,4
83377,"The feather was slightly smushed down (I assume from transit), but he has no complaints and wears it nearly every day as he marches around our house declaring he is the Nutcracker King.",83377,4
83378,it fit perfect because I read the reviews and ordered a size up.,83378,4
83378,I love these pants in purple and just order them in other colors.,83378,4
83378,"Hopefully, they fit well in those too.",83378,4
83380,The design seemed to be a little faded,83380,4
83381,Great fit and quality for the price!,83381,4
83383,It turned my neck,83383,4
83384,I had to order an xxl and I wear a large.,83384,4
83384,the sleeves are a little tight and it's a lot shorter than I was hoping.,83384,4
83384,"I am 5' 8"".",83384,4
83385,I bought this to wear to Oktoberfest.,83385,4
83385,"It is definitely not a high quality or authentic costume, but is great for a one time wear.",83385,4
83385,"The shirt that came with it is fine, but I ended up wearing my own that fit better.",83385,4
83385,No socks come with this costume.,83385,4
83385,The pockets are nice and a decent size.,83385,4
83385,"The way you adjust the straps isn't fantastic, and the ends of the straps just kind of hang.",83385,4
83385,I tucked them into the waistband.,83385,4
83385,"For the money and the fun, it's absolutely worth it.",83385,4
83385,"Just to note, it's made from a velour type of material.",83385,4
83385,"Comfortable, but not substantial at all.",83385,4
83386,The bottoms were too small but loved the suit especially for the price.,83386,4
83387,I like this glases but after one year the frame broke itself,83387,4
83388,This is a beautiful ring although a bit thick.,83388,4
83388,I hope my daughter likes it.,83388,4
83389,"Looking good, it is a 4 star",83389,4
83390,"we like it, just as expected.",83390,4
83391,"Fit was bigger than I expected but still a very pretty, flowy top.",83391,4
83391,With leggings and boots.,83391,4
83392,Different material shown on picture but I like it.,83392,4
83393,I really like the backpack.,83393,4
83393,Bummed one of the cup holder's on the side tore off it's elastic strap just a month after purchasing though.,83393,4
83393,Otherwise its a great sized back.,83393,4
83393,The inside is fuzzy!,83393,4
83393,"PS it's not big enough to pack a bunch of text books in, so if you're looking to pack a big load around don't get this.",83393,4
83394,much better than the others I bought from Amazon.,83394,4
83394,Better quality and hopefully it will survive the test of a few months!,83394,4
83395,"First off, the picture shown is not a John Lennon shirt; it is a shirt made by Brio.",83395,4
83395,"I liked the plaid pattern shown, but the pattern I received is more of a checkered/gingham black and blue shirt.",83395,4
83395,I took a picture of what the shirt actually looks like and posted it with this review.,83395,4
83395,The actual shirt I received is a John Lennon shirt.,83395,4
83395,Its fits like other John Lennon shirts.,83395,4
83395,"The wrists are especially slim, making it difficult or awkward to wear a watch.",83395,4
83395,(You'll get over it).,83395,4
83395,So a star lost for posting the wrong picture.,83395,4

83431,"I'm not exactly small, but I wouldn't even be able to stuff this bra to make it work, lol.",83431,4
83433,It is nice enough to break away from the look of traditional pearls from time to time (Pearls are my normal 'go to' jewelry of choice).,83433,4
83433,"I thought it would be a little more sparkly, especially since  there is more metal than pearls.",83433,4
83433,"However, it is a good weight and lays in a classy way.",83433,4
83433,One star is deducted for some of the links not being finished and smooth.,83433,4
83433,I would not wear this on top of a satin or silk blouse.,83433,4
83434,I like the socks .,83434,4
83434,It looks so cute to my baby boy .,83434,4
83435,I like it can't wait to wear it on summer,83435,4
83436,"After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the medium (I thought I had to order up) but the medium fits and its actually a little large around the waste area.",83436,4
83436,These are perfect for those women who are a little taller.,83436,4
83436,I'm 5-7 around 145 lbs and these are nice and long.,83436,4
83436,"Great for hanging around, wearing as a cami or sleeping in.",83436,4
83436,Perfect for the price!,83436,4
83437,"Okay, first off, this swimsuit is awesome for women on the curvy side, BUT it will require some minor altering.",83437,4
83437,1st (and most important) alter: You will have to reinforceme the boob fabric to the shoulder fabric.,83437,4
83437,All you'll need is a sewing needle and a very basic knowledge of sewing.,83437,4
83437,Just add a few extra stitches to each side of the suit.,83437,4
83437,This will ensure your ladies are a little bit more secure and don't go anywhere - picture included.,83437,4
83437,2nd alter: The padding that is included with this suit... looks like the lady it was modeled off of had grapefruits for boobs.,83437,4
83437,Simply remove the padding and cut each to resemble a more teardrop shape- picture included.,83437,4
83437,"If you got 'em, you won't need the pads at all.",83437,4
83437,"Otherwise, the underwire is a little funky, and might take some adjusting.",83437,4
83437,"Eitherway, its a very nice & attractive looking suit for a curvier woman.",83437,4
83437,"I bought two, and plan on keeping both.",83437,4
83438,"Super cute, fits as expected!",83438,4
83439,Fit well and was very inexpensive.,83439,4
83440,"Much nicer then expected, fit my 10 month old a bit big, but that means we will get a longer use out of it.",83440,4
83440,It holds up nicely after washing and drying it in dyer too.,83440,4
83441,Beautiful my wife  looks  good  in them,83441,4
83442,"Good quality , however it runs small.",83442,4
83442,Th biggest size would be for a us size 8-10,83442,4
83443,"Due to the 50% ""fits too small"" comments, I bought an XL.",83443,4
83443,"I'm 6'0,"" 205 lbs.",83443,4
83443,It's a little baggy.,83443,4
83443,"If I wear a collared shirt under it, then it should be fine but it still makes me look like I'm carrying a spare tire or muffin top at the bottom.",83443,4
83443,I think I would have been just fine with a Large.,83443,4
83443,"It's close enough that I'm not going to return it, but thought I'd help future purchasers who read the size comments.",83443,4
83444,I just wish they had the color I wanted.,83444,4
83444,It's still cute and looks good with a nice pair of jeggings,83444,4
83445,Nice material for the price,83445,4
83447,Super cute but also SUPER VAG.,83447,4
83447,If you have a shorter torso this is perfect on you.,83447,4
83448,Stylish and good price.,83448,4
83449,"Very large across the chest and under the arm pits, too short in the length.",83449,4
83450,The bottom is fine the top is very small for the size in my opinion.,83450,4
83450,Can not use at all.,83450,4
83451,"I would give these 5 stars, but they're fairly cheaply made.",83451,4
83451,Of course for the price I suppose you get what you pay for.,83451,4
83451,I'm 5'6'' and about 155lbs and these were a little tight around my thighs.,83451,4
83451,If you have thick thighs I would consider another product.,83451,4
83451,I needed them quickly for a last minute costume & for that these were perfect!,83451,4
83453,The necklace is really pretty.,83453,4
83453,It's definitely worth the bucks.,83453,4
83453,I had two problems 1.,83453,4
83453,It took a long time for delivery 2.,83453,4
83453,"2 of the hoops that hold the necklace together came loose as soon as I got dressed, luckily I was home when it came apart.",83453,4
83453,After I fixed it No problems.,83453,4
83453,So nice buy just check all your connections before wearing.,83453,4
83454,Had to return as it was too large.,83454,4
83454,Fit was not what I expected,83454,4
83455,"Looks great, lace is too short and doesnt arrive looking like picture.",83455,4
83455,You have to put the lace through small holes.,83455,4
83456,This was a fun mask for Halloween.,83456,4
83456,It was just as pretty in person as in the picture.,83456,4
83456,"I wore it for three events - an adult party, a family party, and to work - and received compliments at each.",83456,4
83458,Love this clutch however was expecting a longer strap.....would have given a five star,83458,4
83459,I'm 6' so it would be a little better for me if it where a little longer.,83459,4
83459,Nice material very cool but also keeps the warmth in when getting out of the shower.,83459,4
83459,"but a little more material would be nice for me, if your somewhat smaller it's probably ok.",83459,4
83460,Love the detail and design - however small on me!,83460,4
83460,Hoping to fit into it once I lose some weight.,83460,4
83461,Very cute but doesn't flatter your body.,83461,4
83461,The material is soft and true to the colors.,83461,4
83462,Good but there are better deals out there,83462,4
83464,"I like to wear mesh shirts under many pieces and was looking for the three basic colors: white, nude and black.",83464,4
83464,Interestingly enough I discovered this was not as easy a shopping jaunt as I had originally thought.,83464,4
83464,"Making the  proverbial long story short, with misgivings I purchased this ""one size fits all"" shirt in the 3 colors because of the price.",83464,4
83464,"Oh my gosh, I was pleasantly surprised to discover these run comfortably small enough to fit a 5'2"" frame well.",83464,4
83464,I'd give them an extra star if they gave an upgraded option of same model shirts in a better quality material with a finer mesh.,83464,4
83465,These boots are so cute.,83465,4
83465,They look just like the picture.,83465,4
83465,"I only returned them
because my daughter did not like them.",83465,4
83466,nice for the price,83466,4
83467,Very pretty and light material.,83467,4
83470,It's small af and perfect for a party at Wet Republic.,83470,4
83470,Or grandma's birthday BBQ.,83470,4
83471,"Looks exactly the same, fit is a bit too big but perfect for my needs.",83471,4
83471,Delivery was quicker than expected as well,83471,4
83472,"These are cute , but run a little small .",83472,4
83473,Cute but fabric gets staticky regardless my granddaughter really liked it,83473,4
83474,I am very happy with this bag and the people who sell it: they take care if their customers.,83474,4
83474,"I never thought that I would find a bag that could hold my new 18"" laptop and my things for graduate school/work.",83474,4
83475,It's what expected but I should've ordered a bigger size because the pants don't go down to my ankles,83475,4
83476,"Cheaply made, but for the price exactly what I expected.",83476,4
83477,"Nice, wish they had larger size.",83477,4
83478,not a jaw dropping stone but a decent cut and color for the price - may make a nice ring,83478,4
83479,These were a gift for my mom.,83479,4
83479,She wears they daily to keep her clothes clean.,83479,4
83479,"She always loves them, but would like some solid colors to be available.",83479,4
83480,I am incredibly happy with this cardigan!,83480,4
83480,I read previous reviews which said that the elbow patches don't line up properly but mine are perfect.,83480,4
83480,"The sleeves are somewhat fitted, so keep that in mind if you have larger arms you might want to size up.",83480,4
83480,"My only complaint is that the ""white"" stripes are actually off-white, so when I put it over a white tank top it looks odd.",83480,4
83480,I am going to look for a beige colored tank like the girl in the photo and I think that'll work fine!,83480,4
83480,"One last thing, I have no idea why this is called a cable-knit cardigan.",83480,4
83480,"Clearly from the photo it is not, it is a cotton stretch fabric fyi.",83480,4
83481,The one front pocket is odd and seems to be sewn into the seam.,83481,4
83481,Not sure why that is other than a bad sewing job.,83481,4
83481,They are super comfortable and I wore them on a 2 day canoe trip a couple of weeks ago.,83481,4
83482,I usually wear S/M in tops but ordered this in L after reading other reviews.,83482,4
83482,"The breast area is very tight, so I don't think I'll have any issues with it falling down!",83482,4
83482,This is mainly why I ordered a L rather than a M as others stated it was tight.,83482,4
83482,"The top is very pretty and flattering, and will look great with white pants, shorts, or capris.",83482,4
83483,"Great shirt, DKNY quality.",83483,4
83483,Deducted one star for the pins that held the shirt in the cover left holes that are visible on the shoulders.,83483,4
83483,Other than that and some minor threading issues.,83483,4
83484,These pants were much nicer than I was expecting for the price.,83484,4
83485,"The sequins on the dress are attached to a mesh like fabric, and underneath is a pink silky layer.",83485,4
83485,"At first glance I didn't like the dress, but when it's on, it looks really pretty.",83485,4
83485,I got a size 8 and I was somewhat small in the hip area.,83485,4
83486,Too large for me.,83486,4
83487,"Great shirt, great price.",83487,4
83487,"I'm a 14/16 & got the US 16, I should have went for US 14 it runs just slightly big.",83487,4
83487,But over all love the style and the color (grey),83487,4
83488,The look and feel are great.,83488,4
83488,"Thought it would fit a bit more snug, but I could be a bit slimmer than I thought.",83488,4
83489,"They were fine, but we're not fancy enough for the jewelry I am making.",83489,4
83491,Awesome...I am looking forward to halloween,83491,4
83492,"I live in Naples Fl, these are such cool pants for here.",83492,4
83492,I am not a big shorts girl so these are a great hot weather option.,83492,4
83492,Be careful when washing though the red from the waist band bled all over the pants.,83492,4
83492,"I liked it though, gives it a funky look.",83492,4
83494,The paper airplane looks better than the infinity necklace.,83494,4
83494,The infinity necklace just looks to cheap and mass produced .,83494,4
83494,The price is good though.,83494,4
83495,"Bought for my 4 year old, and the fit was a bit large, which was okay.",83495,4
83495,He's since grew a bit and now it fits him fine.,83495,4
83495,The strap in the back I think is too long and often gets in the way; but it tightens up well.,83495,4
83496,they seemed to have changed the material--very thin now,83496,4
83497,I ordered a medium because I am medium on top and large on bottom.,83497,4
83497,Bottoms are a little tight since they don't offer different sizes for tops/bottoms.,83497,4
83497,(has to be the same) Top is definitely comfortable.,83497,4
83498,Cute bathing suit but runs very small.,83498,4
83499,Runs on the small side,83499,4
83500,"These are a really nice quality item, nice texture.",83500,4
83500,Color is not my personal favorite though.,83500,4
83502,"I was concerned about the size since it is hard to judge another's ""medium""..... and these are my first mediums in a long time.",83502,4
83502,so i am happy to say they fit; snugly but not uncomfortably.,83502,4
83502,"now, let's see how well they hold their shape and only time will tell~",83502,4
83503,A little baggy but sleeves could be a little larger.,83503,4
83505,I really like the look and feel of these.,83505,4
83505,"I could've ordered a size smaller (according to my measurements on the chart) but purposefully sized up because I wanted them to fit more like a regular fabric short, and not be super stretched or tight against me.",83505,4
83505,"So basically, the size chart seems very accurate.",83505,4
83505,"The pocket is great, but I do wish it were a bit wider or something.",83505,4
83505,"It would be big enough for keys or your debit card or some bills, but a phone would stick up out of them so much I think it would fall out.",83505,4
83505,"If wider, you could have fit it in sideways.",83505,4
83505,"The pocket is just under 3"" wide x 2.75"" deep and then would possible stretch a tiny bit when stretched.",83505,4
83507,Can't go wrong for the money!,83507,4
83508,Not as supportive as my Vionic.,83508,4
83509,"I'm 4 four foot, eleven and weigh below 100lbs, despite my underaverage physique this one size fits all did NOT fit me as the picture shows.",83509,4
83509,"It's not necessarily short, but I don't have the any loose fit shirt going past my hips.",83509,4
83509,It's short enough that if I raise my habd you can see the average sized tank underneath.,83509,4
83510,It's nice but I need to get a necklace lengthener just to wear it and my neck isn't even big!,83510,4
83510,"I draped it over my neck for a picture to show that it wasn't broken or anything, but geeeeez it isn't long enough!",83510,4
83510,"It's not meant to be a choker necklace either, so I don't know why it would even be that small where I couldn't close it even if my neck was bigger.",83510,4
83510,-.- it is nice.,83510,4
83510,I wish I didn't have to buy something else just so I can wear it.,83510,4
83510,(You can see the clasp in the pic too - come on now!,83510,4
83511,Shrinks after a wash,83511,4
83512,wearing well and is what was expected.,83512,4
83512,The zipper on this one better then older versions.,83512,4
83514,This is a great little clutch.,83514,4
83514,I ordered dark grey and received an army green one - I'm not sure if that is their version of grey or if I was sent the wrong color (I don't see such a color listed as an option).,83514,4
83514,There are lots of pockets and zippered pouches and slots to stash things.,83514,4
83514,"I was pleased to see my iPhone fit inside a zippered pocket which makes it easy to grab the clutch and go, having everything I need.",83514,4
83514,I am usually sensitive to smells and the clutch does not have a strong odor.,83514,4
83514,I received it within the time frame and it was nicely packaged.,83514,4
83514,I am returning it as I wanted grey but I will consider the other colors and would order again.,83514,4
83515,Made for foot size 10 or smaller.,83515,4
83515,Not a lot of give at the top for larger legs but can be worn as anklets.,83515,4
83516,Yes needs more slots for cards,83516,4
83517,This is exactly what I was looking for.,83517,4
83517,It hangs loosely around my body while still cut in a feminine and flattering shape.,83517,4
83517,The pockets are at a comfortable spot for my hands.,83517,4
83517,The navy is a true navy color.,83517,4
83517,"My only complaint is that I am worried the fabric will pill, but I can update you all on that later.",83517,4
83519,"very good fabric, and awesome irish green color",83519,4
83520,Chain broke after first use.,83520,4
83520,Mended it and it broke again.,83520,4
83521,"Surprisingly fits well, quality is good.",83521,4
83523,I use it daily and it makes for a very compact minimalistic appearance.,83523,4
83523,"It holds all my cards and my ID nicely and I really like the money clip that's attached to it, the only complaint I might have is that I wish the magnet on the money clip was stronger, I feel that after more than like five bills it starts to get weak on the actual holding of your money.",83523,4
83523,"But besides that, I'm happy with this purchase.",83523,4
83524,"The dress is beautiful, but we had to send it back because my daughter is too busty and it didn't quite work with her figure, but we were sad to give it up!",83524,4
83525,I am 6 ft tall (182.88 cm) average/athletic build.,83525,4
83525,I purchased 1 black and 1 navy blue according to the (confusing) chart.,83525,4
83525,"At first fitting they felt baggy/oversized, especially with the pants.",83525,4
83525,The waist line felt right at belly button.,83525,4
83525,I also noticed the dye from the material was bleeding.,83525,4
83525,After soaking and washing cold for 2 cycles and tumble dry high for 50min I have noticed the dye has stopped rubbing off on my hands/furniture and the material has shrunk.,83525,4
83525,I do not believe these garments have been pre-washed for shrinkage.,83525,4
83525,However they fit as they should now that they have shrunk slightly.,83525,4
83525,The dye has also lightened considerably after 2 wash cycles.,83525,4
83525,"Also, the fabric has softened up.",83525,4
83525,"Shipping was free, arrived in two days to Boston.",83525,4
83525,"Garment label reads "" Wa Bi Sa Bi"".",83525,4
83525,Care instructions are in Japanese.,83525,4
83525,The Craftsmanship is average.,83525,4
83525,"Overall good purchase for the price but, keep in mind that the garments shrink, bleed and fade.",83525,4
83526,"Great shirt, very warm!",83526,4
83526,It runs pretty small but I learned as much from other reviews and ordered accordingly.,83526,4
83526,I normally wear a large so I ordered an XL and it fits perfectly.,83526,4
83526,"Having said that, I have yet to wash it so I will do it in cold and hang dry it (again, per other reviewers suggestions).",83526,4
83527,they run a little small but still make my legs feelgood after standing all day at work,83527,4
83528,Made nicely...just a little small,83528,4
83529,Would have loved it if it fit.,83529,4
83530,May be more light is needed,83530,4
83531,I travel A LOT and was astounded at how much I could pack into this set.,83531,4
83531,My husband even noticed how much stuff I could tuck into these beauties.,83531,4
83531,"Also, the ""doctor's bag"" is big enough that I can tuck in my large 17"" (diagonal) laptop, in a targus sleeve.",83531,4
83531,"That means I can have my laptop out, work with it, carry it up to the gate, then still meet TSA regulations when going through security and/or boarding.",83531,4
83531,I really appreciate the pocket structure on both bags.,83531,4
83531,The rollaboard has a shallow and a deep/wide front pocket.,83531,4
83531,"The front pocket on the satchel can double as a regular purse (it held my big wallet, a make-up kit, brush, etc).",83531,4
83531,"Then, of course, there is the ""peace of mind"" pocket on the back... great for cell phone, tickets,etc.",83531,4
83531,Samantha Brown hit a home run with this pair.,83531,4
83531,"Finally, they are really stylish.",83531,4
83531,"I even get compliments from TSA agents,who have seen it all!",83531,4
83531,"My only criticism:  While the handle on the rollaborad is adequate, I would really like it to be a bit beefier.",83531,4
83531,"However, not enough of an issue",83531,4
83532,I orderered x large based on reviews and its huge.,83532,4
83532,"Nice seeming quality, but just too big.",83532,4
83533,the pants fit perfectly just the waistband is kinda big but they are so soft and comfortable my daughter loves them,83533,4
83534,Good product but more for toddlers than for babies,83534,4
83535,"broke multiple times before event.. but easy to fix and once
looks really good on",83535,4
83536,I cut a little of the elastic inside to make the middle part more stretchy so it would be less tight directly around my waist but other than that it's perfect just like the photo and I receive compliments whenever I wear it.,83536,4
83537,Small crack on lens but doesn't bother from both views but overall wonderful product,83537,4
83539,These toddler socks are very thick and warm.,83539,4
83539,They fit my four year old well and are a little big on my two year old.,83539,4
83539,"I wish they had grippy bottoms and they snag very easily, but they are a good quality fabric so the snags are unattractive but the socks are totally wearable still!",83539,4
83540,"cute ,  little short from top to bottom but overall a cute piece",83540,4
83541,it is a bit see through.,83541,4
83541,looks banging on my girl.,83541,4
83542,Still breaking them in for use at the gym.,83542,4
83542,"I think once I get used to them, they'll work great!",83542,4
83544,Love bag but can not fit iPhone in it.,83544,4
83545,Just a tad too big in the chest area.,83545,4
83545,"But other than that, I am pleased with this dress.",83545,4
83545,I will wear to a wedding coming up in about a week.,83545,4

83547,First time ever needed to order a medium!,83547,4
83548,Wasn't exactly the right color but love it anyways!,83548,4
83549,"The colors are a little different from the shirt we bought at Disneyworld last year, but Disney might have changed the design.",83549,4
83549,Seems to be the same quality as the shirt we bought at the park.,83549,4
83549,"It is a nice, thick cotton that should last through many washes.",83549,4
83550,Cutest little swimsuit !,83550,4
83550,I received it before their projected delivery time.,83550,4
83550,I'm usually a small and ordered a large and it fits great.,83550,4
83550,Quality is nice too.,83550,4
83550,If your not sure on sizing just use the chart they provide that's what I did.,83550,4
83551,I thought it would run small like typical Asian size but the LG is actually large and too big for my US size 8.,83551,4
83551,Not sexy but cute.,83551,4
83552,Im 5'1 118lbs & got the small.,83552,4
83552,"It fit just right, the top was alittle loose but im smaller chested so i expected that.",83552,4
83552,Its a very sexy bathing suit.,83552,4
83552,"The only complaint i have, & another reviewer mentioned this; the ""taupe/beige"" color i ordered turned out to be a weird light purple-ish color.",83552,4
83552,So the picture needs to be updated or something,83552,4
83553,wore it for a wedding- I like that it had pockets!,83553,4
83554,I wish I would have got a size smaller.,83554,4
83554,The cross pattern in the back is sexy!,83554,4
83554,The material is soft and it hold up well in the wash. No complaints here!,83554,4
83554,I purchased another one already!,83554,4
83556,These are well constructed .,83556,4
83556,"My only complaint is that they're bind into my ankle area and feel too tight , otherwise they offer good support overall",83556,4
83557,I love this hat.,83557,4
83557,"I was worried that it would be too small as I have a fairly large head (23"" with my long hair) but I bought it anyway knowing I could give it to my wife if it was too small.",83557,4
83557,"I recommend this hat for most men, but ladies beware that it is indeed large.",83557,4
83557,The build quality of the hat is good.,83557,4
83557,"The bill is moderately firm while remaining malleable, which is great for turning the bill up in different ways e.g.",83557,4
83557,"front and back, or all the way around.",83557,4
83558,Great fit and love the style.,83558,4
83558,A cross between a square frame and wrap around glasses.,83558,4
83558,Best of both worlds.,83558,4
83559,It was way too small in the bust (I prefer fuller coverage).,83559,4
83559,"I reordered the ""Anya"" in a bigger cup and chest size and it fit a lot better.",83559,4
83560,The blouse is very pretty good quality just order 2 sizes bigger than your regular size,83560,4
83561,GOOOOO Class of 2016,83561,4
83562,After about an hour they start to sag in the back,83562,4
83563,"Very cute
Not to big not to small",83563,4
83564,"Comfy and classy, but for the life of me I can't get them to sit just straight...",83564,4
83566,Fits nicely just wish the black part on top would fit better for bigger cheated women.,83566,4
83567,This dress is simple and at the same time cute and sexy I really like it but is a little bit shorter than I expected but is nice just Don't bent when you are using it jajaj.,83567,4
83568,"It seemed to run a little small, and I personally wouldn't consider it a dress, unless you're comfortable with all of your legs and most of your rear end easily visible.",83568,4
83568,"However, I'm really tall, and from the sounds of it that's the style of the dress- to be short- so I wear it as a shirt and love it :)",83568,4
83570,"Happy and looks nice, very soft.",83570,4
83571,"I like it, but I think it should fit a little tighter however I think if I ordered a medium it might be too small.",83571,4
83571,I haven't decided whether to exchange it for a medium or keep it as is.,83571,4
83571,I am a size 8/10 and picked a large - I weigh 160 pounds at 5'6 so I'm not a small framed person.,83571,4
83571,"The material is good, not the ""costume"" material, it is a little giving but not what I'd consider ""stretchy"" or elastic type material.",83571,4
83571,Possibly after I wash it it will become a bit more snug.,83571,4
83572,these are really cute!,83572,4
83572,"I would give them 5 stars if they were a bit thicker, but otherwise I really like them.",83572,4
83572,I have ordered a second pair as a gift for someone that complimented me on them the first time I wore them.,83572,4
83573,"If you have muscular arms and shoulders, arm holes may be a bit snug and rub.",83573,4
83573,"Otherwise I was able to sleep in it, good support for back.",83573,4
83574,I read previous reviews about sizing and I'm glad to have seen that.,83574,4
83574,"I stand 5'7"" about 165lbs and the XXL is a great fit for me.",83574,4
83575,I like the feel of the material but I'm afraid that they're going to snag on stuff.,83575,4
83575,"Having said that, I will definitely be ordering more.",83575,4
83575,"They come up a little high on the waist for my liking, but I'm still going to get more.",83575,4
83575,You can never have too many black sweats!!!,83575,4
83575,I saw somewhat small because I ordered large and I normally wear a medium and they fit.,83575,4
83576,These fit as expected (I am a b cup and they fit exactly).,83576,4
83576,"The cups are a little close together but for the money, it's worth it.",83576,4
83577,Nice leather cover like the pkt's in it.,83577,4
83578,Dress is well made with soft cotton and very comfortable to wear.,83578,4
83578,I am a 40D and the large fits me.,83578,4
83578,The dress is adjustable at the neck.,83578,4
83579,Nice shirt I would buy again!,83579,4
83580,This dress is super cute.,83580,4
83580,The color is more off-white/ivory than white.,83580,4
83580,It's a bit shorter than I thought but it will work for vacation/summer.,83580,4
83580,I read that it ran small so I ordered an XL but think I could have gotten a large.,83580,4
83580,"I'm 5'8"" 155 lbs, normally wear Medium.",83580,4
83581,"cuter then expected, fits great.",83581,4
83581,"However, there were some strings hanging off several of the onsies in the armpit area.",83581,4
83581,Will see how they hold u in the wash.,83581,4
83582,Useless came to small,83582,4
83586,This dress is amazing but unfortunately doesn't fit me.,83586,4
83586,It looks great and the bottom half fits perfect but it's so tight in the chest I can't zip it all the way.,83586,4
83586,I would recommend ordering a size up.,83586,4
83587,"Cute, but fit for the more mature.",83587,4
83588,Bra cups are a bit more demi than I like but the fact that it's built like a bra with adjustable straps (even has a 3 hook back closure under the suit) makes it ok. For some reason I didn't understand that it was a top only - so make sure you order a bottom.,83588,4
83589,"I like it and its very cute on but as other reviewers state, there is some side boobage that may concern us larger busted women.",83589,4
83589,I'm a 34D and I have some side boob showing but its not ridiculous.,83589,4
83590,Will need a slip.,83590,4
83590,But really love it otherwise.,83590,4
83591,I like it but..I didn't realize the sleeves were only 3 quarter length and it wasn't as large as I had expected.,83591,4
83591,If you want the bigger sweatshirt look definitely order a size or two up.,83591,4
83591,"It's still cute, just not completely as expected.",83591,4
83592,"The butterfly wings are exactly as I expected, mostly due to my reading of reviews prior to purchasing and not the actual description.",83592,4
83592,They fit their purpose and the price is great for the quality.,83592,4
83592,"Yes, the color is lighter on the front and vibrant on the back, but it doesn't bother me and looks just fine.",83592,4
83592,"Yes, the stitching on the fingers holes is sketchy at best and one of mine has a hole in the wing by it, but not enough to bother me.",83592,4
83592,I will fix it myself.,83592,4
83592,"The arm holes are smaller and will likely cut in at your shoulders, but not too uncomfortably so.",83592,4
83592,"The size is adult in wing span, but small when it comes to the arm holes and finger holes.",83592,4
83594,No steel boning at all but that's not what wanted.,83594,4
83594,"In my opinion,  if you don't have an extreme amount of fat and excess skin in your torso, this is true to size and I recommend a size down.",83594,4
83594,"If you're very big, get a size up despite your waist measurement.",83594,4
83594,Great fit and just be gentle with the zipper.,83594,4
83594,I haven't had any issues.,83594,4
83594,Very comfortable and makes you sweat!,83594,4
83595,"I would have given the headbands 5 stars, but they are a little too big for my daughters head.",83595,4
83595,"So I do recommend these, but maybe for older babies.",83595,4
83597,The fit was just a little smaller than I'd like but it still fit and was super cute,83597,4
83598,I'd buy this pair but in one size larger,83598,4
83599,good quality for the price.,83599,4
83600,"Colorful, cheap and comfy.",83600,4
83600,"I thought for sure I wouldn't be stuck with one sock
missing from any of these after taking them out of the drier.",83600,4
83600,"Sure enough, three
pairs were missing their 'mate'.",83600,4
83600,How do you misplace socks this colorful???,83600,4
83600,"Anyway, they look pretty cool with two different patterns being worn at a time.",83600,4
83600,"You bought 'em to be noticed anyway, didn't you?",83600,4
83600,"Well, there you go!",83600,4
83604,The material is very soft and comfy definitely for a fall day.,83604,4
83604,It fit my arms and torso good the only thing is that it's more of a fitted shirt which it did not say.,83604,4
83604,It's also from a different co. color story.,83604,4
83604,All in all comfortable shirt just a little snug around my midsection.,83604,4
83605,"Quality isn't fantastic, but for what is it its nice :).",83605,4
83605,This was for the bedroom and my man loved it on me.,83605,4
83605,:) I am 5'2 and 125 lbs and it fit awesome!,83605,4
83606,I like my sweatshirts baggy.,83606,4
83606,This sweatshirt was made for people who either want a perfect fit or don't mind their sweatshirts snug,83606,4
83607,These hat and mittens are adorable...but they are HUGE!,83607,4
83607,I don't think that the size should be listed as 2T-5T as that is a giant range.,83607,4
83607,My daughter is 2 and it looks like this hat will fit her when she goes to middle school.,83607,4
83607,"The mittens shrunk a little in the wash, so we are able to make those work.",83607,4
83608,Something I needed to protect me.,83608,4
83608,Not stylish but functional.,83608,4
83610,Loved the top but it came with a hole in the sleeve and it was slightly too big.,83610,4
83610,"However, I'm happy with my purchase.",83610,4
83611,Love the style and the material fit a bit comfortable except for the arms and certain part of the bag area are a bit tight too close for comfort.,83611,4
83612,Super cute but can be kind of annoying when the straps around the neck get twisted.,83612,4
83612,Although it's not that hard to fix.,83612,4
83613,Very good and comfortable,83613,4
83614,"Shipping took awhile,but I am satisfied with the product",83614,4
83615,"Purchased for husband, the arrived the next day.",83615,4
83615,"He ordered a medium, which fits him well (they are a little snug with hardly any loose fabric).",83615,4
83615,In the future he will order the small because he prefers a tighter fit (more compression).,83615,4
83615,There was a review that the color rubs off.,83615,4
83615,"I have not noticed this, but he wears them under a dark uniform, so I don't know that we would notice in any event.",83615,4
83615,He finds the shirts comfortable.,83615,4
83616,This was a gift for 11yr old daughter.,83616,4
83618,Dress is very pretty and sliming I wish I would of gotten one size smaller,83618,4
83619,Very well designed not complicated but very tight,83619,4
83620,Good size and material for headscarves.,83620,4
83620,I bought all three bundle sets and was disappointed that the range of colors is so limited.,83620,4
83623,This is an adorable sun hat.,83623,4
83623,Its lightweight And the straps are long so its easy to tie.,83623,4
83623,I just wish the brim was a little more sturdy but overall its a great hat and easy to clean if need be.,83623,4
83623,It keeps the sun off her face and neck.,83623,4
83624,"Fits my daughter, but it is teeny tiny.",83624,4
83625,For the price this is a great quality dress.,83625,4
83625,"Its definitely not see through and it looks wonderful however, I ordered the large and was under the impression it was equivalent to a 12/14 and I can't get it fully zipped.",83625,4
83625,I'm 5'9 185lbs and a size 12 pants.,83625,4
83625,Still glad I bought it just gonna have it altered a bit.,83625,4
83625,I've seen dresses that look like this at a $100 or more.,83625,4
83626,"This was just a little small; however, I like it so well and it is so inexpensive that I will give this one away and have already ordered a bigger size for myself.",83626,4
83627,Wish I had ordered a size down or returned for a smaller size.,83627,4
83627,"It's too late now, but they do run large.",83627,4
83627,I like the color and the soft drape as well as the fact that they're great for travel and never wrinkle.,83627,4
83628,Beautiful looks like it is a painting delicate and very pretty,83628,4
83629,Nice fit and fabric but was oddly TOO flattering...too boobalicious for work lol!,83629,4
83629,If you want to enhance your bustline this is your dress!,83629,4
83631,Very cute but a Cami is a must for me.,83631,4
83631,"I'm 5'2"" 130lbs I ordered a medium and it was a little big but fine if you put something underneath!",83631,4
83634,"I normally wear a small in women, but I ordered a large and it fits great.",83634,4
83634,"5'8, 140# and 34dd.",83634,4
83634,"Very cheeky, but I like it a lot!!!",83634,4
83634,I did receive the wrong color....,83634,4
83634,But I still like it!,83634,4
83635,"Not as blacked out as I expected, based on stock photo; considering the price, they're not bad.",83635,4
83635,The glazed coating on the frames isn't done well- there's seemed to have been lint or something stuck on the frame before they were glazed.,83635,4
83635,"Bye, frames are shiny!",83635,4
83635,Not matte at all,83635,4
83636,"Although the hat is adjustable, it is still a little big ( and our little guys has a big head for his age), but he will continue to grow and it fits well enough to still be useable, just a little loose.",83636,4
83636,"Otherwise the quality of the hat is good, and very happy with the purchase.",83636,4
83637,These hats are great for the OR I highly recommend them.,83637,4
83637,I am sad though one of the elastics in mine unraveled and came loose.,83637,4
83637,I do think I can fix it.,83637,4
83637,They are lightweight which is great for working in high temp OR's.,83637,4
83639,The dress came as it looks and I think the material is fine.,83639,4
83639,Not cheap or see through.,83639,4
83639,I'm only iffy about it only because of my height and it came a lot baggier than I imagined.,83639,4
83639,Overall it's really cute and am satisfied with my order.,83639,4
83639,I'm 5'1 and I ordered a small.,83639,4
83639,It also came in only a week!,83639,4
83640,too small on a 36C bust :/ looks like a sports bra.,83640,4
83640,but cute with a sheer/see through flannel on :3,83640,4
83641,I love the shirt it's gorgeous and its school appropriate.,83641,4
83641,The downside is it's a little see through and the neck lining is a little weird!,83641,4
83642,I bought these for my sister and she LOVED them.,83642,4
83642,She wears them to work with her Danskos.,83642,4
83642,"They are good material with really great, vibrant designs.",83642,4
83642,I just wish there were more different ones.,83642,4
83642,I know they are men's socks...but who cares...women want artsy socks too.,83642,4
83643,Perfect for children as these are cheap and beautiful.,83643,4
83644,I love the coat even though it is oversize.,83644,4
83644,"When I first got it it had an musky order that is slowly fading, which is unfortunate to deal with.",83644,4
83644,"So far the coat had kept me toasty when is snowed, during an ice rain, and during a good gusty blow.",83644,4
83644,"With the exception of the smell, I am please with this coat.",83644,4
83645,I like the fabric.,83645,4
83645,I ordered L but I use M. It fits a little big.,83645,4
83645,However it looks nice..,83645,4
83646,Dress is very pretty but much shorter than expected.,83646,4
83646,"I thought it would be at least tea length, it is knee length.",83646,4
83646,"Dress fit was perfect, cape is small.",83646,4
83646,Grand daughter likes it and that is what is important.,83646,4
83647,Size runs  bigger than  expected,83647,4
83648,Perfect size for a little girl.,83648,4
83648,"I gave this to our flower girl, along with an expensive gift that she would have forever, and she LOVED it!",83648,4
83648,she is 6 and it fit her perfectly.,83648,4
83649,Very comfortable flip flops.,83649,4
83649,I compared to previously owned flip flops of this brand.,83649,4
83650,"Other than a piece of thread coming undone, the waist trainer was perfect!",83650,4
83650,Started to see results after 3 days.,83650,4
83651,Looks cute but wish it had at least one clasp in front,83651,4
83652,The colors are bright like I'd hoped for.,83652,4
83652,I am disappointed that my medium body (size 10) does not comfortably fit in the large.,83652,4
83652,I'm sure my size 6 sibling will be happy with my purchase.,83652,4
83653,color is a little less vibrant than the pictures show,83653,4
83655,"Bold colors but very fun, nice fit.",83655,4
83655,"This design is sleeveless, and OK; other dresses had trouble with cap sleeve.",83655,4
83657,I haven't tried them on because I'm 37 weeks pregnant and ordered them for post partum in hopes to smooth out my squishy tummy after.,83657,4
83657,Seems like good quality material and shipping was very fast!,83657,4
83657,"The only thing is that I ordered the 2 pack, 1 black and 1 charcoal.",83657,4
83657,I ended up receiving 2 black pairs.,83657,4
83658,Extremely well for the price I paid for.,83658,4
83659,Pretty fair if you are in a hurry.,83659,4
83659,I must say they look good.,83659,4
83659,I was complimented in NYC.,83659,4
83660,There is nothing wrong with the dress or quality.,83660,4
83660,It just overall doesn't do anything for my daughter.,83660,4
83660,"It looks frumpy on her (we sent measurements)- she lost her waist, chest area and cute little bum .",83660,4
83661,It is super cute.,83661,4
83661,"Keep in mind, sizes run just a tad bit smaller than a normal ""american"" size.",83661,4
83661,It is just though and I love it a lot.,83661,4
83661,:) I just wanted it to be a little bit longer on me in the front....,83661,4
83661,Tank top underneath it is.,83661,4
83661,shows more skin on me than on the model.,83661,4
83661,Thats why  Isay go up a size if you want more of the look of the model.,83661,4
83661,Also the sleeves are not LONG they are 3quarter sleeves.... unless that is another reason to go up a size from your normal size.,83661,4
83662,This necklace it really cute!,83662,4
83662,It comes with a awesome sturdy chain the colors and picture are really vibrant.,83662,4
83662,The only downside is the one metal hoop that held the clasp on was a tad flimsy but was easily mended by replacing it.,83662,4
83662,The chain is long but I feel it fits the style of the necklace nicely.,83662,4
83663,The product itself was just as described and I was very pleased with it once it arrived.,83663,4
83663,"However, it was purchased using Prime and set to arrive in time for a gift exchange and did not show up within the prime shipping range.",83663,4
83663,"So, unfortunately no one but my closet will ever know how nice this item is.",83663,4
83664,"This corset feels like a really good quality for waist training, and much less expensive than a lot of the big brands.",83664,4
83664,It doesn't feel cheap at all and looks really good too.,83664,4
83664,Sizing is on point as well.,83664,4
83664,"I love it, but would suggest anyone do research on waist training before attempting cuz it can be dangerous.",83664,4
83664,"Otherwise if it's just for fashion and you're not actually planning on sizing Down with it, go up a size, cuz the back can look a little messy and won't close all the way since it's designed to shrink you down to the point where the backs eventually meet.",83664,4
83665,Definitely what was in the add.,83665,4
83665,"One of the balls on one of the barbells came cross threaded and I would rather have the cross threading than have it broken so, I guess it will have to sit crooked on the threads.",83665,4
83665,"Still haven't used the needles so, I can't say if they seem good or not.",83665,4
83665,"Four is the highest I would have given because of the flaw on the barbell, but worth the investment.",83665,4
83666,Great jersey and good price.,83666,4
83666,Show your polish pride during the Euro 2016!,83666,4
83666,Fits as expected and light weight,83666,4
83667,I bought these as a gift for my niece and she loves them she's already worn them twice and she hasn't complained,83667,4
83668,Surprisingly it was ok overall.. Lovely but a little small..how do I put up a pic?,83668,4
83670,"Great tie clips,my husband loves them.",83670,4
83671,I wear a medium and I ordered XL.,83671,4
83671,"My shoulder to shoulder measurement is 15', weight 133,height  5'1  so I order two sizes up the blouse is some what small around shoulder and upper back area.",83671,4
83671,The color and make is as described but am disappointed with the size.,83671,4
83672,a bit large but not bad.,83672,4
83673,This dress was shorter than expected.,83673,4
83673,Definitely need to wear leggings or something under it.,83673,4
83674,"Cute top...just a little smaller around mid section
Working to make it fit for next summer.",83674,4
83674,Need to be about 135 ...Not company's fault,83674,4
83676,"I love how you can adjust the shoulder length because that matters on how much is shown on the sides, and the bottom elastic kept rolling up, that's why the 4 stars, but I just made a small cut along the inside of the side of the shirt to cut the elastic inside and voila, it fits perfectly and so sexy yet the girls never fall out!!",83676,4
83676,My husband loved it when I surprised him wearing it!!,83676,4
83676,"The purple is a very pretty plum purple and the shipping is much faster than I expected, received it in only about 10 days!!",83676,4
83676,"Bought another in black, I loved it so much!",83676,4
83676,"As far as size, I'm 5'6"", weigh about 175 and wear about an XL to a 1X with a 42C bust and ordered the XXLarge and it worked fine, if you do what I did with the elastic bottom or it'll just keep rolling up!!",83676,4
83677,A little big/long but the Opal is pretty and it's been the best ring out of the few I bought at once.,83677,4
83678,Loved this pretty top!,83678,4
83678,"It's a little bigger than I wanted, since many reviewers said to size up and I did.",83678,4
83678,"If you like it snug, don't size up.",83678,4
83679,Love the product it's made very beautifully and I was very surprised that it was made sturdy !,83679,4
83679,I bought an XL and it fit as expected I wanted the extra squeeze for the lift and it did just that :) wish they made this same product where it comes over you back like a strap and under boobs area that would be awesome!,83679,4
83679,The piece only comes up to your chest leaving all your back fat to bulging..,83679,4
83680,I've only had my EP51s for a few days but they're pretty nice.,83680,4
83680,"PROS:
* Super comfortable, great for workouts
* Charge lasted 4 hours, at which point I recharged them overnight
* Relatively inexpensive but fairly high quality

CONS:
* Audio quality is acceptable but hardly audiophile.",83680,4
83680,"Base is audible but weak
* Bluetooth only pairs to one device at a time",83680,4
83681,They ran a bit small but I do love them.,83681,4
83681,My toddler loves the big designs.,83681,4
83682,what more do u want for that price???,83682,4
83682,I've worn it 3-4 times already.,83682,4
83682,the clip is a little messed up but it'll work for now... u get wht u paid for but with a nice design!,83682,4
83683,Weak stud but nice overall.,83683,4
83686,I usually wear a large and that is what I ordered but it's too small especially in the bust.,83686,4
83686,But really pretty and I will get a size larger.,83686,4
83687,"It was for my daughter, she loves them and lounges around in them all the time.",83687,4
83688,It is beautiful and just what I wanted.,83688,4
83688,It doesn't come in any kind of jewelry bag or small gift box though.,83688,4
83688,It just comes wrapped in cheap plastic so you will need a small box or something to put it in,83688,4
83689,This is a very pretty ring!,83689,4
83689,Ordered it & then was afraid to wear it as I worked in the receiving department of a big box hardware store at the time & was afraid the top of the stone would get scratched.,83689,4
83689,"Didn't have it long enough to see if it would, because unfortunately one of the smaller stones around the garnet fell out after wearing it for less than 6 hours, so I didn't have worry about scratching the large garnet stone.",83689,4
83689,"Contacted the company & sent it back almost immediately, which was a shame because it really is a gorgeous ring.",83689,4
83689,"Due to where I worked, I opted to replace it with a ring with a smaller stone, which isn't as pretty overall.",83689,4
83689,I would definitely order it again & hope for a better outcome now that I no longer work in a hardware store.,83689,4
83690,"I really like the beanies because they're a great fit :) The colors I got were black, black, grey, bright red, burgundy, and Royal blue.",83690,4
83690,"I was under the impression that I was getting the colors in the picture, but I'm not too upset about that.",83690,4
83690,"I would have liked the green one, though :/ They're also women's beanies; not men's.",83690,4
83690,"That worked out in my favor, but I'm just pointing it out.",83690,4
83691,My baby has big ankles and legs.,83691,4
83691,These fit perfectly all other sock in the same size were too tight.,83691,4
83691,Very stretchy and cozy for him.,83691,4
83692,This is a coin purse.,83692,4
83692,The questions about shoes are not relevant.,83692,4
83692,"I is, however, a darling silicone jelly coin purse.",83692,4
83693,I little thin but alright,83693,4
83694,"The product itself was beautiful as in the picture, but the gift packaging could be much better than a cheap cardboard box.",83694,4
83694,I used a Pandora box from a previous purchase at a jeweler.,83694,4
83695,"Really cute, great quality, beyond my expectations.",83695,4
83697,"A little on the small side and thin material but stretchy, planning on wearing for my baby shower",83697,4
83698,Nice quality and fit well.,83698,4
83698,Will buy from this company again.,83698,4
83698,I will wear this with Capri leggings.,83698,4
83699,Although i like my purchase it wasn't the style that was pictured.,83699,4
83700,"The way it is made is excellent, but the 1X is still too small.",83700,4
83701,Cant wait to get these laced on,83701,4
83702,"Would have preferred the design went all the way around, but still like it.",83702,4
83704,"It looks good but the color is a bit off, not what we expected at all.",83704,4
83704,I gave it as a gift for a snow boarded but unsure if they will keep it the quality and style are accurate the color is not great at all.,83704,4
83705,But the white shirt is a bit see through.,83705,4
83706,"I bought this as a gift, and I loved it.",83706,4
83706,I only wish they made this a bit thicker but other than that its a pretty cool sweater.,83706,4
83706,I'm thinking about getting one for my self!,83706,4
83707,"As described, except bigger than I anticipated.",83707,4
83707,"I ordered M/L and should have gotten a S, which would have been plenty big enough.",83707,4
83708,I just received my top today.,83708,4
83708,"I really like it and for the price, I can't complain.",83708,4
83708,"However (yes, I know), please be aware that the edges come frayed, a very unclean neckline that YOU NEED to cut to make it look 100%.",83708,4
83708,That's why I'm only giving it a 4.,83708,4
83708,"I am 5'3"", weight 160, and I bought a size 14 and it fits perfectly.",83708,4
83708,"I normally wear a ladies size large, so I wasn't sure 'number-wise' what that translated to.",83708,4
83708,"Since the description said it ran small, I took a chance with the 14, and it looks great.",83708,4
83708,"Well, the sleeves are too long, but a little under fold and I'm good to go.",83708,4
83708,Can't beat the price ladies!!!,83708,4
83708,(Tried to add a photo but I'm writing this from my cell phone and the option isn't available.,83708,4
83708,"Oh well, I'll see about adding a pic later...)",83708,4
83709,I am recovering from a severe injury and have run through quite a few orthotic brands.,83709,4
83709,"I can only wear one specific shoe at the moment, but the original insole was too flat-footed, hence the custom insoles.",83709,4
83709,I have very high arches and was afraid these wouldn't be enough support.,83709,4
83709,Others I have tried have provided more arch support.,83709,4
83709,"these are very soft and cushy, but so far, they have held up my arches pretty well.",83709,4
83709,"I severely injured my ankle, so if the arches are not held up, my ankles turn and hurt, so although I can tell these are not quite as firm as others, they are doing the job!!!",83709,4
83709,And my arches are very high!,83709,4
83709,"My other issue is a cracked heel bone, and that's where these beat all the others.",83709,4
83709,The extra softness lets me actually walk.,83709,4
83709,"(Bone technically healed, but the lingering pain will be going on for a while....)",83709,4
83711,It is a good set,83711,4
83712,These are nice but be careful about sizing.,83712,4
83712,"My son wears 8-9 in regular Crocs (unlined); I bought the 9 in these lined Crocs, which ended up being significantly smaller than the 8-9, and then I exchanged those for size 10, which were about an inch longer.",83712,4
83712,"Aside from that, the shoes seem durable and soft on the inside.",83712,4
83712,The material seems somewhat thicker / less flexible than the traditional Crocs.,83712,4
83713,Fits nicely and works for what we need it for.,83713,4
83713,The sliver beads do tend to come off easy but easy to fix.,83713,4
83714,"Shirt has a nice Atari logo, making it a nice addition to my video game apparel.",83714,4
83714,"The silkscreen is ""distressed"", meaning that it looks as though it is worn.",83714,4
83714,"It is, however, not the best quality material.",83714,4
83714,"I expected a shirt this price to be made of a heavier cotton, but turns out it is more of the same thinner weight as those $6.99 t-shirts you get in the bargain bin at big box stores.",83714,4
83714,My guess is that probably all of these retro shirts are like this.,83714,4
83714,"For it to hold up, I'd recommend washing it on cold delicate cycle and dry on delicate.",83714,4
83715,I ordered a pair of these leggings in a different pattern several months ago.,83715,4
83715,Same size and they fit great.,83715,4
83715,This time the fit was much more snug.,83715,4
83715,Almost couldn't get them on.,83715,4
83716,"These are not pink, more of a muted red.",83716,4
83716,They fit well and stay on though.,83716,4
83717,I love that I can match my outfit for yoga.,83717,4
83717,"I can feel the slip resistant "" beads"" .",83717,4
83718,"My daughter loves it, but we are going to exchange it for a larger size.",83718,4
83720,"Nice wallet, fun designs.",83720,4
83720,I still use it after a few years...even though the fun design wears away rather quickly.,83720,4
83721,This is too cute.,83721,4
83721,The colors are bright and bold.,83721,4
83721,A lot of fun to wear.,83721,4
83722,Pros: colors are vibrant!,83722,4
83722,I love this outfit and so does my daughter.,83722,4
83722,Shipping was faster than expected....Amazon says it is still on its way and we received it last week.,83722,4
83722,Cons: made of very thin material.,83722,4
83722,Pants are more like capris.,83722,4
83722,"It fits smaller than the size 7 we ordered.....which is two sizes up than what she wears, since they are Asian sizes.",83722,4
83722,The outfit is cute and will work for her.,83722,4
83722,Overall it is worth the price for the product.,83722,4
83723,"Super thin, but that's really how they are supposed to be.",83723,4
83723,"Colors look like in the picture, so no issue there.",83723,4
83723,"Only reason for 4 stars is that the sleeves actually have little poofs on them that (because they are thin) aren't terribly noticeable, but I would rather they were just normal sleeves like in the photo.",83723,4
83724,"Good quality shirt, but there is a huge 7x7"" patch on the pack stating the numbers 56.",83724,4
83724,The website does not show this view.,83724,4
83724,"Personally, this makes it look like a mans shirt.",83724,4
83725,"Though it's much more translucent than it appears in the picture, so it kind of blends in with my skin instead of standing out like I'd hoped.",83725,4
83726,"It's the real thing, but it's a bit costly for a hat that costs less than $5 to make",83726,4
83727,It was used a a gift.,83727,4
83728,"the color is a little lighter than the picture, but love the feel of the material and the way it fits, I'm a DD and it does fit snug but not to snug.",83728,4
83729,Good value for the cost.,83729,4
83730,Ran a bit bigger than my other Terra-SJ blouses.,83730,4
83730,"Could have used a M instead of L but too much of hassle to return,",83730,4
83731,My wife was pleasantly surprised and when I wore these.,83731,4
83731,She loved the feel and the look.,83731,4
83731,Definitely something sexy for her to enjoy!,83731,4
83732,my usual size 7 or 6.5 would have been too long.,83732,4
83733,"I love these bras, but they don't have an incredibly long life--the fabric pills rather soon.",83733,4
83733,The fact that they can be had at such a great price helps indeed!,83733,4
83735,Get the next size up.,83735,4
83735,Tends to shrink up a bit.,83735,4
83736,It is very cotton.,83736,4
83736,I didn't realize that when I ordered it which is my fault.,83736,4
83736,I bought three colors and stack it with blazers.,83736,4
83736,"So in other words, it can be dressed up or thrown on with jeans....wordy-sorry",83736,4
83737,nice quality no problems.,83737,4
83738,Only stretches width not length,83738,4
83739,Looks like it may last for a bit.,83739,4
83739,Purchased for my 16 yr old daughter and she loves it.,83739,4
83740,Good quality and construction unfortunately it was a little tight.,83740,4
83740,I wear 7 in Skechers Shape ups and 6.5 sandals.,83740,4
83740,I ordered these boots in 7.5 and they felt slightly tight.,83740,4
83740,My feet are somewhat wider than medium and I have developing hallux so I usually order one size up in boots.,83740,4
83740,But after reading the reviews I ordered only half size bigger and it was not roomy enough for me.,83740,4
83740,People with narrow to medium feet probably don't need a full size larger.,83740,4
83740,"I sent my boots back because they didn't fit, otherwise I was happy with the look and quality.",83740,4
83744,This a beautiful dress it's long to the floor covers my feet!,83744,4
83744,However bust area is low cut v and it's not cap sleeves it's sleeveless...feels good and looks expensive..!,83744,4
83745,Wore this to my wedding reception and got many nice compliments.,83745,4
83745,Only downside was that the lace fabric snagged on EVERYTHING!,83745,4
83745,There is now a hole so I don't know if I can wear it again.,83745,4
83747,Very cute top but do be aware it's quite large.,83747,4
83747,I ordered a large based on the measurements and it fit more like an XL or 1X but not a big deal at all since it's supposed to be flow-y.,83747,4
83747,Came over 2 weeks sooner than expected which was awesome.,83747,4
83747,Estimated arrival was Sep 7 and it came today on Aug 22!,83747,4
83747,Not bad at all for the price definitely worth the buy!,83747,4
83748,Decent tanktop for not a bad price.,83748,4
83749,Really like the dress a lot,83749,4
83750,"It's big, but I will get that fixed.",83750,4
83750,It is nice though.,83750,4
83751,Reasonably good quality strap.,83751,4
83751,Stitching is sturdy and the material is of good quality.,83751,4
83751,"Color seems lighter than the picture shows, however.",83751,4
83751,"Haven't used it long enough to rate the durability, but it certainly seems like it will hold up to normal use.",83751,4
83752,"Rather thick, cotton fabric and the end of the fabric is very poorly finished.",83752,4
83752,Unfortunately there is not enough fabric to cover much of my toes.,83752,4
83752,"I don't have long toes, so disappointed.",83752,4
83753,Just wish you could buy additional buckles separately.,83753,4
83754,A nice basic hat that will look good on anyone.,83754,4
83755,"I love the skirt design, it is very cute.",83755,4
83755,I ordered one size up and it's perfect.,83755,4
83755,I got white and it is a bit see through.,83755,4
83755,Will require nude underwear.,83755,4
83755,Also beware of panty lines!,83755,4
83755,"The slit comes just above my knee when I walk, not too high.",83755,4
83756,The belt is good and all it arrive as expected and right on time my only concern is the H is small but yea is pretty good recommend it,83756,4
83757,l like the jacket.,83757,4
83757,"Very light and comfortable, with a lining to add a bit warmth..",83757,4
83757,I have other heavy jackets and was searching for something for mid cool weather.,83757,4
83757,"The lining is a stretchy fleece and it does tend to pull out the wrist end of the sleeve as it drags on a long sleeve shirt, but a simple tug on the shoulder sets it right and I'm good to go.",83757,4
83757,Not a big deterrent for an otherwise pleasing jacket.,83757,4
83758,Great gift for the Harry Potter fan!,83758,4
83759,"Nice design, runs a little small",83759,4
83760,"Used them for pictures and they held up, also came with a back up earring, not sure if that was on purpose or mistake.",83760,4
83760,"Overall, the color and quality worked for me.",83760,4
83761,"They are a little smaller than expected.. My wife wears small in Victoria's Secret panties and these, in their only size available, are just a tad small on her.",83761,4
83761,"They do fit, just a bit small.",83761,4
83761,"Aside from the size, they are definitely hot and my wife says they are very comfortable.",83761,4
83761,I only gave them 4 stars because I think it's stupid that they only offer them in one size..,83761,4
83762,I'm giving it 4 stars because I haven't had it long enough to test it's durability.,83762,4
83762,The package arrived on time and in good shape.,83762,4
83762,The product was as pictured and described.,83762,4
83762,"There was no strong odor, as some plastic/oil based products can have) upon arrival.",83762,4
83762,All three worked as expected (squeeze) both ends and it opens up.,83762,4
83762,"I did have to pull up the slitted sides and it's harder in cold weather, but they should loosen up over time and everything, including me, stiffens in cold weather.",83762,4
83762,"I think $2 each is a more reasonable price, but they appeared to be the best value I found.",83762,4
83762,"I don't normally carry change, but keep it in my vehicles or a piggy bank (true story!).",83762,4
83762,I put one in each vehicle to keep change organized and easily find what I need at the drive through.,83762,4
83762,The third one is a backup or maybe useful on a trip when I can't avoid change gathering.,83762,4
83762,"If you're looking for a convenient, fit in your pocket, functional coin purse, here it is.",83762,4
83763,"Nice sweater, but it tends to attract little pillies to it.",83763,4
83764,Pretty but too tight around the shoulders.,83764,4
83765,"Love the top, fits perfectly, color is lovely, feels good on the skin too....",83765,4
83766,I'm going to have to re-hem and haven't been able to wear it yet as a result.,83766,4
83767,Bust area was a little on the small side but other than that I loved it,83767,4
83768,Fits ok but would have preferred a better quality fabric.,83768,4
83769,Beautiful Knit Top that just looks special when worn!,83769,4
83769,"I ordered this for my teenage daughter and it just a beautiful, colorful and playful piece of clothing.",83769,4
83769,I would recommend this for any young lady who likes a casual style.,83769,4
83771,It did run a little smaller than I generally wear.,83771,4
83772,"Fit as sized, material is light, length could be longer (I like them longer then normal.",83772,4
83774,"A bit snug, but holds in what it needs to",83774,4
83775,My default shoe for almost 40 years!,83775,4
83776,"The top was shorter than expected, and tighter but super cute and shipping was quick.",83776,4
83777,I ordered green and blue but received gray and green.,83777,4
83777,"Ordered a medium and fits fine, I was worried because all the labels are in Chinese.",83777,4
83778,great sun protection for baby!,83778,4
83778,manufacturer can possibly consider putting a flexible brim so you can shape/flip it up so it doesn't flop down in baby's face as easily..as well as a clip closure around the neck/throat.,83778,4
83778,not as easy to tie on & off while juggling baby,83778,4
83779,Bought this for my dad and he really likes how breathable they are.,83779,4
83779,I would recommend to anybody looking for big guy shirts.,83779,4
83780,"Fit's well, flexible with movement.",83780,4

83786,I was pleasantly surprised to receive a quality belt for the price I paid.,83786,4
83786,I only gave it a four star rating because I have not used it yet.,83786,4
83787,Was cute will work for what I want it for.,83787,4
83787,Not for a bigger woman.,83787,4

83793,They are right and left foot specific.,83793,4

83794,It's the kind of low key bathing suit you can wear everyday and feel both comfortable and stylish.,83794,4
83795,I ordered a size Medium.,83795,4
83795,"I am 5'4"" and 140lbs.",83795,4
83795,"VERY see thru, need a slip to go underneath.",83795,4
83796,The top is very cute.,83796,4
83796,My only issue is that it fits a little loose in the arms and shoulders.,83796,4
83796,I usually wear a small but ordered a medium due to non US sizing.,83796,4
83796,"I am 5'3"" and weigh 118 lbs.",83796,4
83796,I think it would have been perfect if I would have stuck with my true size.,83796,4
83797,"Adviertised for diabetcs,  I do not have diabetes but My feet swell and this largenss in sock does not put any pressure on my feet..Attractive and comfortable.",83797,4

83797,Have the colors available and wish they came in more feminine colors.,83797,4
83797,I am a female size 10.5 shoe.,83797,4
83798,I'm not a big women and I think I have normal sized arms but they were definitely a little tight at the top!,83798,4
83798,Other than that they will look perfect with everything else I ordered!,83798,4
83799,My only issue is that I require more separations for the card.,83799,4
83799,I have doubled up on a few cards but The can't be identified easily.,83799,4

83801,it's cute and pretty as an anklet.,83801,4
83801,"i love it when i go out because even if it's noisy, you can still hear the little bell sounds.",83801,4
83801,"but I'm usually home with my parents and they tend to get annoyed because our house is quiet so when i walk around, the bell is kind of loud.",83801,4
83802,Shirts fit very well.,83802,4
83802,However I was hoping that I didn't have to iron them but that is not the case.,83802,4
83802,It doesn't wrinkle when you are wearing it but it does have to be ironed.,83802,4
83803,For reference I'm 5ft6in and weigh about 150lbs and wear a 34-36b bra.,83803,4
83803,I ordered size 12/14 and it fits however it doesn't really hug my body since its ribbed; catchesand shows all the fuzz tho.,83803,4
83803,"The chest area fits nicely but around my hips, the dress has rolls and doesn't lay flat nor does the bottom of the dress hug my thighs like shown in the picture; also ends about 4ins from my knee.",83803,4
83803,Also the neck line is rather high on me and doesn't remotely show cleavage.,83803,4
83803,All in all its a good dress at a good price but I might have to invest in some alterations to get that perfect fit.,83803,4
83804,I bought a few things from this supplier and I realized that their jewelry is of a good quality.,83804,4
83804,"Not ex collect, of course.,but a good buy.",83804,4
83805,"If this came in a larger size, I would order MORE and give them 5 stars.",83805,4

83805,"I wear a 34 normally, and the Large is just a tad too small.",83805,4
83805,But I'll still keep wearing them.,83805,4
83806,Size up on this one.,83806,4
83806,Material is a bit thin but I wear a tank underneath.,83806,4

83811,(In order from most transparent to least),83811,4
83813,"Very nice outfit I'm going to wear it valentines I'm 5""7 weight 170 I bought a med.. A large also would have worked but I prefer a med I don't like loose clothes",83813,4
83814,"Great dress, I read some other reviews and some said that the dress is too short.",83814,4
83814,"I disagree, I'm 5'5"" and 140lbs with a 36DD bust and the dress felt both comfortable and not too sexy.",83814,4

83814,"Perfect summer dress that can be segwayed into fall with leggings, boots, and a scarf!",83814,4
83815,Liked this shirt the material is a little to thin for me though.,83815,4
83815,Fit is flattering and sizing is pretty much as you would expect,83815,4
83816,"The sizing is just right on some fingers, but the rings tend to slip off.",83816,4
83816,"Nonetheless, they're a good purchase if looking for midi rings.",83816,4
83817,Wife loves it....I ordered it one size too small ( my error).,83817,4

83820,They came in super quick and they're really well made.,83820,4
83820,"They're sturdy, so while the two black bands are adjustable, it's hard to really finagle.",83820,4
83820,The spiral is just impossible though.,83820,4
83820,"For the price, it's a great deal.",83820,4
83821,I get a lot of compliments on this dress.,83821,4

83823,"The hat fit him perfectly, which was a big relief, as his noggin is a little on the big side.",83823,4
83823,The only thing that was off putting was that it had a super powerful chemical smell.,83823,4
83823,"It had to be left out to air out for a couple days, and then it was fine.",83823,4
83823,"If you or your child has a sensitivity to strong scents, I'd advise opening it in a well ventilated area or outside.",83823,4

83826,"Super cute, and fits well overall!",83826,4
83826,"It isn't as loose as it seems to be in the photo, but the material is  super soft and the shirt is one of my new favorite.",83826,4
83827,I really like this bathing suit however it does run small.,83827,4
83827,"also, there was a weird extra string of fabric hanging from the bottoms but that can be easily cut off.",83827,4
83827,"Other than that, its a really sexy suit and as pictured, I just wish I sized up.",83827,4
83828,Decent quality for the price but difficult to attach.,83828,4

83830,It feels a little flimsy BUT it does a great job at keeping my two year old dry.,83830,4
83830,The bubble shape makes it so that her tiny self can keep it down and her face dry.,83830,4
83830,I love it and want an adult version lol,83830,4
83831,"The color is as pictured, and the wig is adjustable, so it will fit a range of head sizes.",83831,4
83831,"The only reason that it doesn't get 5 stars from me is because it's a little thin, and if the hair isn't positioned *just* right, it will show the webbing underneath.",83831,4
83831,"For what I paid though, I'm really happy.",83831,4
83832,"My granddaughter says it's very, very warm.",83832,4

83836,"Plus, I was not covered enough on the sides.",83836,4
83837,This dress fit somewhat small because I need to lose a few pounds before it will be completely comfortable.,83837,4
83837,This will be a perfect dress for the summer as it is light and stretchy.,83837,4
83837,It's plain so it provides many enhancement options.,83837,4
83838,Owl broke off after about a week.. Had to super glue it back on.,83838,4

83841,"I normally wear an XXL, but ordered an XL.",83841,4
83841,"It fits nicely over a tee shirt, but I can't wear it with a liner, or even with a sweat shirt.",83841,4
83841,And certainly not with both.,83841,4
83841,I think the sizing issue is a fashion thing.,83841,4

83842,They look fantastic and the return process seems to be simple.,83842,4
83843,Actually smaller than what I expected.,83843,4
83843,But it's actually really cute and it's purpose is served.,83843,4
83845,"seems to be well made and warm, but winter will tell me more about that.",83845,4
83846,The ankle opening could be a bit wider or use a more stretchable thread for an adult.,83846,4
83847,I love everything about this dress aside from the fat that it is pretty short.,83847,4
83847,It's such a cute dress though and the pattern is great!,83847,4
83848,"Simple no metal buttons, zippers or netting.",83848,4
83848,In new era type caps I wear 8 - 8 1/8 so 3X fit good a slight bit taller than what I would like but after years of no bucket hats this is a great one.,83848,4
83848,Might buy a second for backup.,83848,4
83849,"I like the skirt, it's light and comfortable the only issue is its a little too think.",83849,4

83850,They are easy on with the velcro.,83850,4
83850,They are also easy off.,83850,4
83850,Could be a bad thing as I have picked them up after being tossed from the stroller at the mall.,83850,4
83851,It was a little deeper shade then it appeared in pictures,83851,4
83852,It's a good product I could have gotten a medium instead of a large .,83852,4

83860,It fits very SNUG.,83860,4
83860,Please keep that in mind when you get the watch.,83860,4
83860,Men that have thick wrist may think twice before getting this watch due to the band.,83860,4
83860,The time is hard to see due to it being black.,83860,4

83906,"Pretty, unusual, quality good for price, not over-sized.",83906,4
83907,I am 5 feet tall and 100 lbs.,83907,4
83907,"This dress hits mid thigh, and isn't as snug on me as I wanted it but I love the material and the look of it.",83907,4
83907,It is just as described!,83907,4
83908,Costume fit is on the smaller side and generally for longer torso's but the costume itself is well made and nicer than expected.,83908,4
83909,Lunar Rock is not color pictured...it is definitely gray!,83909,4
83909,I am sending it back for the Esther color and will update on that color.,83909,4
83911,Good price & quality.,83911,4
83912,Too small and didn't fit right me.,83912,4
83912,So I am dieting till I can fit this!,83912,4
83913,"Really pretty, very roomy.",83913,4
83913,Mine retained its bright colors.,83913,4
83913,I did take the elastic out of the sleeves as I didn't like that.,83913,4
83913,"It's really much warmer than I expected, but I guess that depends on the person.",83913,4
83913,"For me, it's probably better for fall.",83913,4
83914,I love the feel and look of it!!,83914,4
83914,"Only thing I didn't expect was that either the holster is small, or it wasn't efficient enough to hold a gun (fake, of course).",83914,4
83914,"I was hoping for it to hold my gun, but it would not hold or stay in.",83914,4
83914,"Overall, perfect design and fit for my costume!",83914,4
83915,"The Packaging was great, The earrings are exactly as shown,just received them today3/8/16 so far so good",83915,4
83916,It is beautiful but I did have to cut a few threads.,83916,4
83916,I love that it is reversible.,83916,4
83917,the headband irritates slightly,83917,4
83919,I  can make adjustments if needed so I am satisfied with it,83919,4
83920,Dress gems were blue and very loose but dress is absolutely beautiful.,83920,4
83920,"It is very long as my daughter is 5'7 and wearing 6"" heels.",83920,4
83920,We had to tack the dress together in the front because of prom rules about midriffs showing so if you need to do that as well it can be done easily without looking altered.,83920,4
83920,My daughter is a Size 7 so the 8 was a little loose but still fit very well.,83920,4
83921,Worked to make my wide dresses a little narrower.,83921,4
83922,It could just a little more space,83922,4
83924,Fitting was SUPER DUPER fast!!!,83924,4
83924,They are super cute on.,83924,4
83924,I ordered a size up for comfort and they are nice and roomy.,83924,4
83924,I can wiggle my toes around :)...Haven't worn them out yet so I'll follow up with an update soon!,83924,4
83925,Very warm but a little difficult to put in,83925,4
83926,the product is ideal for me.,83926,4
83926,it fits me a little loose which is good for me,83926,4
83927,"loved this, got me through the tough pregnancy days!",83927,4
83927,elastic stretched by the end of pregnancy though and the rubber that holds it in place cracked so I gave it a 4,83927,4
83928,I ordered a size up as recommended still a bit tight for me in crochet area.,83928,4
83928,Looks nice very thin material.,83928,4
83930,"Very cute, love the blue color.",83930,4
83930,"Fits great, was shipped fast.",83930,4
83931,Came down a lil far,83931,4
83932,Beautiful but does fit a tag larger than expected.,83932,4
83934,It's a pretty nice bag for this price.,83934,4
83934,I carry this everywhere from work to weekend use.,83934,4
83934,Saw a friend who has same bag in purple and decided to give it a try.,83934,4
83934,The open is great that there are U-shaped channels to keep the mouth open oppose to the top of the bag collapsing on you when you try to put stuff in.,83934,4
83934,The two downsides are the bag feels quite heavy without anything in it and the zippers feels like it gets stuck once in a while oppose to the smooth pull.,83934,4
83934,Overall it's a great bag for daily use.,83934,4
83934,Also strangers comes up to me often to ask about the bag and a couple of my friends and their friends already ordered one.,83934,4
83935,Kinda close to being a crop top!,83935,4
83937,They didn't get 5 stars because they're smaller than they should be.,83937,4
83938,I have been looking the a small cross body bag and this certainly fits the bill.,83938,4
83938,Plenty of room for necessities.,83938,4
83938,"There was a slight odor when I opened the box, but not a big deal.",83938,4
83938,The bag came in a very nice box for gift giving.,83938,4
83939,The brand is awesome.,83939,4
83939,The fit can be a bit confusing.,83939,4
83939,I usually where a LGE but went for the Med the second time around,83939,4
83940,Looks exactly as pictured!,83940,4
83940,One of the charms fell off when I accidently tugged the choker too hard which is why this received 4 stars instead of 5.,83940,4
83940,However this was nothing a little tweezer couldn't fix.,83940,4
83941,Too small and you can see thru it.,83941,4
83941,"However, I gave it to my daughter and she wears it with a tank to under.",83941,4
83941,She is happy with it.,83941,4
83941,The colors are very pretty.,83941,4
83942,"The swimsuit is very cute, overall.",83942,4
83942,I like that there is a tie around the neck and back for the extra support in the bust area.,83942,4
83942,The under layer is a bit odd and seems to be made for a very long torso.,83942,4
83942,I have to pull up the bottoms and the middle doesn't fit quite right.,83942,4
83942,"However, you can't see it through the top layer, so no one else would really notice how awkward the long see-through mesh section really is.",83942,4
83942,"Additionally, I agree with the comment that there is absolutely no support around the middle area, so if you have a thicker middle, you may not like the lack of support.",83942,4
83943,"Ordered a Medium got a large, Still fits",83943,4
83944,Bottom fits good but top was big but it's ok,83944,4
83945,The hat is exactly as I saw and purchased.,83945,4
83945,I did not give it a 5 Star as the packaging was inappropriate for a hat such as this.,83945,4
83945,The vertical dimensions of the box were way to small and the hat was crushed to make it fit.,83945,4
83945,I had to steam it to get it back to acceptable shape.,83945,4
83946,I bought some for my son and then also as a bday gift.,83946,4
83946,They love bed then!,83946,4
83947,For the price can't beat it,83947,4
83948,Cute bag but not great quality.,83948,4
83948,The fabric is very thin.,83948,4
83948,But our GiGi loves it!,83948,4
83949,"just like on the picture, looked great the only thing is the ""om"" sign is like a hook and grabs on to everything haha, eventually it came off.",83949,4
83950,The jacket is very nice.,83950,4
83950,The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I ordered the navy jacket and when it arrived it's actually teal.,83950,4
83950,"It's a very pretty teal and my daughter loved it, but I just wanted to make sure everyone knows that if you are needing a navy jacket.....this is not it.",83950,4
83950,"Otherwise, it is a very nice jacket.",83950,4
83951,"I ordered up one size, but these were still on the small side.",83951,4
83952,I'm 5'4 157 lbs and it fit great!,83952,4
83952,It took me a bit to figure it out but I found the hole!,83952,4
83952,The slit is very high but that's what I wanted.,83952,4
83953,My daughter is in kindergarten and its very big on her.,83953,4
83953,I have the straps as small as they go and its big.,83953,4
83953,But its very nicely made.,83953,4
83954,This is a nice shirt made of quality.,83954,4
83954,The only reason I did not give it 5 starts is because the hem where the lace is doesn't lay properly.,83954,4
83955,I really like the style of this sweater but the fit was misleading.,83955,4
83955,I ordered an XL and found it fit snug.,83955,4
83955,Most sweaters in this size fit more like the one does in the photo.,83955,4
83955,It's a nice sweater and looks great on my daughter which is why I gave it 4 stars.,83955,4
83955,The material is nice and warm--doesn't look cheap.,83955,4
83956,I usually wear an XL and I needed a 2X to fit.,83956,4
83956,However it is very cozy!,83956,4
83957,"I read other reviews to go a size larger and the item said it was ""Asian"" sizing, so I ordered a large when I typically wear a medium.",83957,4
83957,A medium would have fit just fine or even a little better.,83957,4
83957,"The Black4 color is not black, it's navy with pink, blues and yellows.",83957,4
83957,This style is shorter with longer sleeves.,83957,4
83958,This is a great skirt.,83958,4
83958,"Nice texture, no pilling,  I do wish it had a more defined waist with more elastic.",83958,4
83958,It tends to slip down a bit.,83958,4
83958,You might try a size smaller.,83958,4
83958,"It stays up, but if I needed to run from zombies, it would slip down and they would get me for sure.",83958,4
83959,Love these- but you they are sheer in the rear!,83959,4
83960,pretty well described in he picture.,83960,4
83963,This is very cute and well made.,83963,4
83963,It comes in only one size which fit me perfectly and I wear a small.,83963,4
83963,The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is that the yellow is significantly darker than in the picture.,83963,4
83963,"If you are looking for a butter yellow, you will be disappointed.",83963,4
83964,A casual shoe that lights up the day.,83964,4
83966,"If you don't have perky boobs your going to need a bra to wear with it, which kind of defeats the purpose because it shows ""side boobage"".",83966,4
83966,It's a nice shirt & I love the color but unless you have a bra that goes with that design everything will show on the sides.,83966,4
83967,I'm 5'10 bought a large and it fit great every where except it was super short but it makes a great bathing suit cover up/beach dress!,83967,4
83968,"top is great, bottom is ""eh""",83968,4
83969,It was more sheer than I was expecting but very soft.,83969,4
83970,Much more rugged shoelace that holds the tie.,83970,4
83970,I expect the product will perform once I get the laces wet (fording streams),83970,4
83972,For the fit and look it is great!,83972,4
83972,The materials are soft and smooth.,83972,4
83972,"I love the feeling that nothing bonded me around :) However, you better hand wash it.",83972,4
83972,Washed it when I got it.,83972,4
83972,"Color runs like crazy, so be careful not to mixed with light colors.",83972,4
83972,I hope the color will settle after several washes.,83972,4
83973,I really like these sunglasses a lot!,83973,4
83973,It meets my needs as far as it protecting my eyes and the fact that they are Polarized makes it even better!,83973,4
83973,I love the fact that the nose pads don't leave a mark on my nose and that these actually stay on my face since they are pretty lightweight!,83973,4
83973,"The 2 things I do have to worry about are scratching the lens and poking my eye out with the tips of the ""Temples"" (Long arms on the sides of the frame) where I could easily poke my eye or someone for that matter.",83973,4
83973,"Overall, it's stylish and does the job!",83973,4
83974,"Good quality, except the globe isn't round, but more of a slightly squished football shape.",83974,4
83974,It spins in the necklace.,83974,4
83974,You can't tell just by looking that it is a kind of weird shape.,83974,4
83975,it's a gift hope she likes it,83975,4
83976,"It isn't the highest quality but considering that most novelty items like this are complete junk, this item was surprising and relatively good quality.",83976,4
83976,Love the jacket - it's details are a very nice addition to the entire outfit.,83976,4
83978,"Love them, comfy, a little roomy but better than tight",83978,4
83979,A solid leather belt.,83979,4
83979,"But I ordered a size smaller figuring that my 2"" buckle would make up the difference but apparently they already calculate that in.",83979,4
83979,I can barely get my buckle into the 1st hole.,83979,4
83979,Make sure that you order your size.,83979,4
83980,Very cute one piece.,83980,4
83981,My son loves Elmo.,83981,4
83981,"But this became incentive for him to ""wet his pants"" so that he could get change more frequently.",83981,4
83981,Overall the pants quality is good.,83981,4
83981,We put them in wash almost every other day and the color is still good.,83981,4
83981,But the size is a little small.,83981,4
83981,My son is pettit and he thinks they are a little small as well.,83981,4
83981,I would buy one size up.,83981,4
83982,Picture can be misleading on thickness bc it's a very light coat,83982,4
83983,Cute didn't care for wire the pendant is on would rather have a chain style.,83983,4
83983,Good for price paid.,83983,4
83985,I bought these for my mother in law.,83985,4
83985,She has small feet and they are a little tight on her.,83985,4
83985,She still loves them because she needed some socks and they are cute.,83985,4
83985,Next time i'll buy a bigger size.,83985,4
83986,This came very quickly and looks nice.,83986,4
83986,"Although the pendant is on a ribbon, there is hardware in the back with a lobster claw and a chain.... the only problem is that the links on the chain are too small for the size of the claw.",83986,4
83986,"The only one it fits in is the very last link, which makes it a deeper necklace.",83986,4
83986,"While this works well for me, it might be problematic for those looking for more of a choker look.",83986,4
83987,I wish XL would have been a little bigger.,83987,4
83989,Looks exactly like the picture!!,83989,4
83989,"This is a very stylish, classy retro backpack.",83989,4
83989,The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it is on the smallish side.,83989,4
83990,"A bit daring in terms of cleavage exposure, but heck, its for a vacation in Cancun!",83990,4
83991,"Fit was good, the only thing I did not like we're the hard very circle pads in it so I took them out and will use softer ones.",83991,4
83992,i get compliments on this backpack constantly.,83992,4
83992,i love the extra compartments.,83992,4
83992,"the only downside is, if you're like most ladies who like to have EVERYTHING in their purse (in case of an ""emergency"" ya know), you'll definitely have to sacrifice.",83992,4
83992,"it fits what you need, not all the extra stuff lol
it also came with a cute little coin purse :-)",83992,4
83994,I ordered the Large and feel I made the right decision.,83994,4
83994,"I'm 5'5"", 135-140 lbs, 38B, and waffle between an 8-10 or M-L in women's clothes and am short waisted so I usually buy petite tops and dresses.",83994,4
83994,I have had 3 children and currently have a pizza baby.,83994,4
83994,":)
I have celulite on my booty and the backs of my thighs.",83994,4
83994,This suit is cute.,83994,4
83994,"It's not fabulous, but it's fun.",83994,4
83994,"It does not push your breasts together and up to create cleveage, as suggested by the phrase ""push up"" in the product description.",83994,4
83994,The cups are hard and formed but hollow and quite separated.,83994,4
83994,"It would be ok for someone with bigger breasts, but not a bigger chest - pretty tight under the arms.",83994,4
83994,"It's lined, but no tummy control and no rutching.",83994,4
83994,"I've attached a pic, but I'm totally sucking in.",83994,4
83994,":)
It's not magic, but it's cute and I feel cute wearing it.",83994,4
83995,I like the look of this top but the washing instructions could be an issue.,83995,4
83995,I'm sure the instructions are to keep the shape and quality.,83995,4
83995,This is an excellent price for this top.,83995,4
83996,"Very cute, but very small.",83996,4
83997,Pretty and very light,83997,4
83998,Mainly because I prefer underwear without writing.,83998,4
83998,The material is great and they fit so nice.,83998,4
83998,The only downside is that they do roll up the thigh.,83998,4
83999,"It's a very sexy fitting dress, the only place if it doesn't fit very well is the very bottom.",83999,4
83999,It's just a little loose.,83999,4
83999,"I would definitely recommend, especially for $12.00!",83999,4
84000,This dress is absolutely beautiful!,84000,4
84000,The blue is so pretty and it is so sparkly!,84000,4
84000,"I do have to have a corset back put in it as the zipper stops at the middle of my back, but I have a large chest.",84000,4
84000,If you are bigger on the top I would suggest going up a size but other than that I have no complaints.,84000,4
84000,Can't wait to wear it for prom.,84000,4
84002,My daughter loved the comfort of the bands and big flower.,84002,4
84002,The colors were great and matched tons on outfits!,84002,4
84002,Also added a great pop of color to any outfit!,84002,4
84003,"These came a little too large for what I was expecting for some reason, I gave to my mom and she loves them.",84003,4
84003,They are really soft and comfy and the pockets are the best added bonus!,84003,4
84004,I bought this dress for my 16 year old daughter.,84004,4
84004,It is exactly what she likes to wear.,84004,4
84004,It looks great and fits well.,84004,4
84004,I bought it in her size and that is not the way I have to buy other clothing on Amazon.,84004,4
84004,Overall I am very happy with this dress.,84004,4
84005,Love this .... but photo showed a gold tone watch and it's a silver tone watch.,84005,4
84006,The grip socks are so cute on.,84006,4
84006,I would purchase from this vendor again.,84006,4
84007,Not as supportive as a regular sports bra.,84007,4
84007,They are cute though and look nice on!,84007,4
84007,I usually wear them on lifting days not cardio days.,84007,4
84008,"For the price, it's a good deal.",84008,4
84008,"Love the green stone, just not sure about the rhinestone embedded piece in front.",84008,4
84010,Challenge to put on yourself.,84010,4
84011,Not an original but still good.,84011,4
84012,Fits well and keeps you warm.,84012,4
84013,Nice quality and a good compact size for phone and wallet essentials.,84013,4
84013,"Although my Iphone 6s technically did fit in the center zippered compartment, it was a tight fit.",84013,4
84013,"If you need to get your phone out quickly or frequently,  I suggest either cutting the zipper out or storing the phone in one of the side pockets.",84013,4
84013,This was the perfect clutch for what I needed and comes in many colors and cute designs.,84013,4
84014,"great jacket, very warm.",84014,4
84014,fragments of infill fibers poking out around the seems.,84014,4
84014,need to improve on QC,84014,4
84018,Took a long time to get but look so cute.,84018,4
84018,Was never cold enough to wear so I can not comment on wearability.,84018,4
84020,Great price and very nice necklace,84020,4
84021,I'm pleased with the style of this jacket.,84021,4
84021,"Like other reviewers, I immediately removed the patches.",84021,4
84021,One other problem is that it is too long.,84021,4
84021,"I have a long torso, so for someone with a shorter trunk, the length would be even more pronounced.",84021,4
84021,"Because the zipper is just sewn onto the top of the vest and not sandwiched into the fabric, I may move the zipper up so that I can hem the vest.",84021,4
84021,"It does seem like a lot of work to get the vest to the point of being flattering and usable, but for this price, maybe I should have expected that.",84021,4
84021,I was pleased with the fabric and the fit at the armholes.,84021,4
84022,"They look great without being too flashy, which is good because a tie clip is supposed to be an accent piece.",84022,4
84022,"It's a little tough to clip it through the layers of tie and dress shirt, but unlike the alligator type clips, they don't move around nearly as much.",84022,4
84022,"However 1.9"" is a little too big to be used for most ""skinny"" ties these days.",84022,4
84022,"If you have skinny ties, I would recommend going with a 1.5"" tie clip.",84022,4
84023,"Nice, not as dark in color as I expected.",84023,4
84024,Will write a review after I wear it at the beach.,84024,4
84026,"Fits good, didn't shrink after first wash.",84026,4
84028,This is a more revealing swim coverup.,84028,4
84028,"This focuses on the cleavage, so if you have got it, flaunt it!",84028,4
84029,Beautiful dress bought it for my daughter to wear to a daddy daughter dance she loves it.,84029,4
84029,It is just a little too loose in the chest area so my mother n law is going to fix that.,84029,4
84029,I ordered a 10 and she usually wears 10s no problem.,84029,4
84030,Very nice especially for the price.,84030,4
84030,They were just what I was looking for.,84030,4
84031,Product  was not completely assembled when I recieved but for price good deal and problem was easily fixed.,84031,4
84033,"I like the shirt and it fits fine, however the print of Zoidberg is smaller that is represented in the product picture.",84033,4
84034,I'm 6 foot tall and could wear 3 inch heels...but that made me look like a giant lol.,84034,4
84034,"This is perfect for a long dress which is what I wanted, but I will still need to hem it (which is a good thing in my opinion).",84034,4
84035,i have big thighs and these fit great!,84035,4
84036,It's a well made bag.,84036,4
84036,Has enough room for what I need to carry on a daily basis,84036,4
84037,"Cute, but runs small.",84037,4
84038,This belt is far nicer than would be expected judging from the price.,84038,4
84038,It is great in every aspect except sometimes the the buckle catches on something and the belt loosens :(,84038,4
84040,Way too big and wide.,84040,4
84040,"I'm not sure my daughter would ever be able to use this

Update:

So I was wrong, my daughter is now 21 months  and they finally fit and are great to wear around the house",84040,4
84041,"I ordered 3 Hoodie outfits 1 of each color for my Nephews, one for a 2yr old and two for 3yr olds.",84041,4
84041,I was very pleased that they arrived a week earlier than the estimated date.,84041,4
84041,I opened the package they came in so I could feel the material thinking it would be thin but to my surprise it wasn't.,84041,4
84041,I didn't feel like cheap material.,84041,4
84041,"The 2yr old and 3yr old sizes looked about right, if anything just a tiny bit bigger but better bigger than smaller.",84041,4
84041,I would have given 5 stars but since it's a gift I won't know what will happen after the first wash but I would definately recommend this outfit.,84041,4
84042,"This is a good wallet, it holds a lot.",84042,4
84042,I honestly wanted it to be a little bit bigger.,84042,4
84042,"A seam is starting to come lose, I will end up getting fabric glue to seal that down and keep it from getting worse.",84042,4
84042,It's a pretty color (I got the turquoise) but it does get dirty easily.,84042,4
84042,"I do grab it when I need to run into the store but it's not big enough for a proper notepad or my phone, which is what I was going for.",84042,4
84043,"The arch is quite firm, and it takes some getting used to until they are broken in.",84043,4
84043,"I have to loosen up my laces to get them to fit more comfortably, and this is after removing the old insoles - as stated in the directions.",84043,4
84043,"So, they are noticeably thick and cushy.",84043,4
84043,I am getting some relief from a heel spur by using these insoles.,84043,4
84043,"I average about 2-3 miles a day on concrete, walking only to and from work, and manage to wear out insoles within a year, where good shoes last me 2-3 years if I can replace the insoles periodically.",84043,4
84043,These are some of the better insoles I have found.,84043,4
84044,Why not to create it in a porper size ?,84044,4
84044,"I wear L, and it is like S. I like roses.",84044,4
84044,Now i have to give it away some one who can enjoy it.,84044,4
84045,Stones are pinker than pictured.,84045,4
84046,"I love the item, just need to feel a little more confident in the size I bought.",84046,4
84047,The socks seem to help swelling in my feet.,84047,4
84047,I feel better now that I have them on.,84047,4
84048,Only thing I didn't like was that it was very staticky.,84048,4
84048,"I sprayed it with hairspray, but that didn't seem to help much!",84048,4
84049,The bibs were really cute and soft.,84049,4
84049,They looked just like the picture.,84049,4
84049,They seem to be catching the drool well and not getting soggy.,84049,4
84051,The shirt is great but the problem is the alien.,84051,4
84051,It looks nothing like the one in the photo.,84051,4
84052,I just send them back twice because they were too small otherwise once you get the right size they're great obstacle racing shoes,84052,4
84053,Was a little wrinkly when I got it and there's extra fabric that keeps popping out by the V line neck area which is annoying.,84053,4
84053,It's comfy and glad I went with a Medium.,84053,4
84053,"I am 5'2"" with 34B bust it fits me perfectly I recommend you guys go a size up from what you would be!",84053,4
84053,Can't wait to wear this to school and out in the spring and summer !,84053,4
84054,The quality of this dress is really nice and the colour is just as the display i ordered a large in this dress i am a 36dd hip 41 and 5'3' the only alteration i made to this dress was to add two press studs to the breaks on the front so they would have a nice fold.,84054,4
84055,I like this dress on my daughter,84055,4
84057,good workmanship and look forward to gardening come spring,84057,4
84058,I'm a 34 C/ 36 B bra size and while the fit was great all around it was a tad too small around my boobs that it definitely shows my bra.,84058,4
84059,"Very cute, a little smaller than expected",84059,4
84060,You have to be careful taking off the bindis from the pack because the rhinestones come off if you're not too careful but other than that they're super cute,84060,4
84061,"Really like it, ordered a large when I'm normally a medium, and it's perfect.",84061,4
84062,Bought them for my daughter who's scared to have her ears pierced.,84062,4
84062,She absolutely loves them.,84062,4
84063,Bag it's great for the price but after reading other reviews I thought it would be bigger.,84063,4
84063,It's about the size of a hand bag with shoulder straps.,84063,4
84064,It was a gift for my boyfriends mother she liked it!,84064,4
84065,I bought a size larger then I needed.,84065,4
84065,Also washed it first.. Then I was very satisfied,84065,4
84067,"This shirt fit a little larger than expected, but not bad.",84067,4
84067,"It's really pretty, loose & flowy.",84067,4
84067,I like that it's flattering for a post partum body and also a stylish nursing top that doesn't seem like one.,84067,4
84067,The color is nice and vibrant.,84067,4
84067,I absolutely love that the back is a little longer to cover the bum.,84067,4
84067,It works out great to wear with pants or leggings.,84067,4
84067,Some cons would be that it gets a little staticky and also that the fabric is so flowy that sometimes my nursing bra or breast pad outlines stand out a lot and require adjusting.,84067,4
84067,"Overall I'm happy to find affordable, cute nursing tops and am glad to have this and another of a different color in my wardrobe.",84067,4
84068,Good product and service,84068,4
84069,This is a very pretty bracelet and can be worn for both day and evening.,84069,4
84069,There are gold seed beads interspersed among the turquoise beds.,84069,4
84069,There are 3 sections of the bracelet that have wire threaded through to keep the coils tight together.,84069,4
84069,"Be careful when you run your hand over the beads on your bracelet, one section of the wire keeping the coils together was broken and a piece of wire was sticking out and scratched me.",84069,4
84069,Also I found a section of about 6 beads that was broken and left the wire exposed.,84069,4
84070,The one I received differed quite a bit from the photo.,84070,4
84070,"For one, the logo is much small.",84070,4
84070,"For two, there's no writing on the back.",84070,4
84070,"I personally don't care, since I don't really like shirts with a back design, other people should be aware that if you're getting the shirt, especially from China, it probably won't match the product photo.",84070,4
84070,"Otherwise, it's a quality shirt and the logo is a good transfer.",84070,4
84070,It feels like it will last for a long time.,84070,4
84071,"I like the way it looks ,but I don't like the fact that the time doesn't show until you press a button,it doesn't stay on the screen.",84071,4
84072,Very unique and stylish...,84072,4
84072,I call it a swarf!,84072,4
84072,"Wraps a bit smaller (Im a Small) than the photo but then again, the mannequin looks super tiny.",84072,4
84072,I receive compliments every time whenever I wear my swarf.,84072,4
84074,Nice wallet but kind of small if you're someone who carries a lot of credit cards,84074,4
84075,I got a med thinking that would be good since usually i get a large.,84075,4
84075,But med is still to big,84075,4
84076,The light blue is definitely more of a mint color to me but it is incredibly soft.,84076,4
84076,"Hopefully they will hold up okay, happy so far.",84076,4
84077,They're perfect for what they need to do.,84077,4
84077,"Easy on and off, fits as expected.",84077,4
84078,"I like it very much, but will exchange for a size smaller.",84078,4
84079,They are completely so shown.,84079,4
84079,Though I wish they could have been thicker,84079,4
84080,"Worked for me for a Comic Con weekend, didn't last mush longer.",84080,4
84080,"Gold coloring scratches off easy, will need to replace with a higher quality product for daily wear.",84080,4
84081,"This bag is great, perfect for work.",84081,4
84081,I only gave it four stars because it is a lot smaller than I expected but it is very sturdy and stands on its own.,84081,4
84081,Very neat and professional looking.,84081,4
84081,I got it in black.,84081,4
84082,"I just received these today and much to my excitement, I ripped the packaging open to look at them and try one of them on.",84082,4
84082,"About the underwear themselves, amazing look and feel visually and when I tried one on, it was instant arousal to me..I loved the way it feels and fits especially where the member goes through..got me aroused right away and then of course made these look even sexier!!",84082,4
84082,I totally agree with most other reviews in that it does not expand well enough in the sack area and that part feels a bit too contained and tight.,84082,4
84082,"One other thing is if you pull the thong up too much, you'll counter the front of course and it feels uncomfortable on Mr.",84082,4
84082,So you have to find the happy medium there.,84082,4
84082,I got a size larger based on the other reviewers and was a good thing.,84082,4
84082,"The waist is fine but the sack area, too tight.",84082,4
84082,Still feels awesome and looks great at the main pipe area!!,84082,4
84082,Fabric is so soft and feels GREAT!!,84082,4
84082,I will wear these often as I can..may get more!!,84082,4
84082,Would give it 5 stars and order 3 more sets if they could expand/design the sack area bigger..doesn't hurt..just too much contain.,84082,4
84083,"fits nice, a little thinner fabric than I was expecting.",84083,4
84083,Buttons are tight to use.,84083,4
84083,Had compliments on it when worn.,84083,4
84085,"Looks good on, I would suggest this product to a friend.",84085,4
84085,I can't wait to start it to the upcoming party,84085,4
84086,Looks great and keeps the ears warm,84086,4
84087,Good quality but the fit is for a 6--18 month old.,84087,4
84087,Not a 3 year old.,84087,4
84087,Wasted my money so I took a star away.,84087,4
84088,Nice can't wait to wear them.,84088,4
84090,Great looking hat for my OU grad living in San Diego.,84090,4
84091,I ordered a size up as I do with all costumes.,84091,4
84091,This one is comfortable and fun.,84091,4
84092,I like the way the pants give me a nice shape and it hides my front tummy pudge lol,84092,4
84093,Very pretty top but just didn't fit right on me,84093,4
84094,"thick enough, warm and feels durable.",84094,4
84094,not bad for the money,84094,4
84098,Cute purse and it's a nice size.,84098,4
84100,Fits just as I thought...,84100,4
84100,Size up like the other reviews say...,84100,4
84101,The yoke is surprisingly lined with a satiny material and I worried that it would be too warm.,84101,4
84102,"fabric is soft & nice, the fit is a bit small I ordered a XL being a 34 - 36 waist and still felt tight.",84102,4
84103,Colors where not as bold but it is still a nice skirt.,84103,4
84103,It was like a handkerchief skirt.,84103,4
84103,It's fine with me.,84103,4
84104,I haven't tried it on so I don't know how it fits but I received it with the braid part in the front.,84104,4
84104,A lot of reviews said it did so I was skeptical but all I did was re arrange the straps and now it's perfect.,84104,4
84104,It took almost two months to get to me though.,84104,4
84105,"Bought this for my boyfriend he absolutely loved it, the band was a little big for him but we went and got it sized for about $8 in the mall, the time was set for eastern time but it was easy to readjust it and the date was set a day ahead.",84105,4
84105,The watch came in right on time.,84105,4
84106,"I doesn't fit small persay, I guess I failed to read the material but it is a very nice shirt.",84106,4
84106,I actually liked that it was tighter on my arms and flowy the rest of the shirt.,84106,4
84107,"I am 5' ft 3"" inches and 105 pounds.",84107,4
84107,"This fits well on me, just a little bit loose.",84107,4
84108,Its cute but the waistline in too big i have no belly so it big i put a belt to make it fit my waistline,84108,4
84109,"I thought it just custom type shirt, this is real shirt, it is too fancy for the price, the square buttons need little patient to button up, and hope don't lose them.",84109,4
84109,sim fit very well!,84109,4
84110,They are a little large and stretch quickly.,84110,4
84110,I ordered them to moisturize my feet at night.,84110,4
84110,"So, I don't think they will be useful for this purpose.",84110,4
84111,The fit is a bit too big...,84111,4
84111,I was looking for more of a baclava style scarf but I cant fault the product.,84111,4
84111,Just fit too big!,84111,4
84111,And Im 6 foot tall!,84111,4
84112,Too big for my son.,84112,4
84112,And just be sure to wash since it comes from China all the transporting etc smells tend to get in package.,84112,4
84114,"Got it for myself, but it ran small so I gave it to my daughter as a Christmas present",84114,4
84115,Fits very nice on me,84115,4

84119,She wears it to work and is the talk of the office...in a good way...,84119,4
84119,It fits a little small and smelled like fish when we got it but nothing a little washing couldn't help.,84119,4
84120,They're really cute but I got a lot of the same ones.,84120,4
84120,Good price for 25 though & came earlier than expected!,84120,4

84123,This is smaller than the standard charms.,84123,4
84123,"It is cute and I like it, though.",84123,4
84124,"Fuzzed up with washing - I know, you're not supposed to wash a sweater but I'm not going to hand wash stuff so they need to hold up.",84124,4
84124,"Other than that, they work great with leggings or just putzing around the house.",84124,4
84126,Package came super fast.,84126,4
84126,None of them were missing or broken.,84126,4
84126,Has a great variety and some duplicates.,84126,4
84126,One of my balls did crack though but for this price and the amount that you have in here you honestly can't beat this deal.,84126,4
84127,Fabric thinner but not see through.,84127,4
84128,I ordered my size based on the recommendations.,84128,4
84128,I wore this top in Vegas and was very comfortable.,84128,4
84128,it is a little thin but that's what I was going for so it was okay.,84128,4
84128,I might order the black one some day.,84128,4
84129,"The only ""complaint"" I could really have is that the material is slightly thinner than expected.",84129,4
84129,I will have to purchase a slip to wear underneath.,84129,4
84130,A little larger than I thought it would be but for a fun T it works just fine.,84130,4
84131,Was a day late.,84131,4

84133,"I ordered two sizes up according to the reccomendations of other reviewers, glad I did.",84133,4
84134,too small and no flowers on front top,84134,4
84135,The scarf is VERY pretty.,84135,4
84135,I didn't give it 5 stars because the material is pretty thin.,84135,4
84135,"I don't think thin is necessarily a bad thing since you can wear it when it's warm outside also, but it was so thin that it snagged on the first wash.",84135,4
84135,"If I fold it correctly, I can hide the snag.",84135,4
84136,I usually wear a large in ladies or x large in jrs.,84136,4
84136,I ordered this in a xl after reading reviews.,84136,4
84136,"Although  I love the look and fit, it's just  a bit short.",84136,4

84137,great to grab and go!,84137,4
84138,"The costume looks a little different than in the picture, but it did the job.",84138,4
84138,It runs a little bigger than expected.,84138,4
84138,I am usually between a small and a medium.,84138,4
84138,I ordered the medium to be safe and it was a bit large.,84138,4
84138,I should have gone with the small.,84138,4
84139,"so, my daughter loves these shoes, but they were very tight on her.",84139,4
84139,"in most of her shoes, a 12 has a bunch of wiggle room, but i could barely get these on her, and she complained before she even stood up.",84139,4
84139,"what's odd, is i bought her the court graffik shoes (also by DC) in the same size 12, and just like all her other shoes, she had tons of room.",84139,4
84139,"we wound up ordering a 12.5 in the trase, and while they fit, i can tell they will only fit for a short time as they were fairly snug....length was ok, but they are considerable tight around the foot pad area... if you can find a size that fits your kids feet, they are nice shoes...",84139,4
84140,Sleeve length said 34/35.,84140,4
84140,I was concerned because my sleeve length is 33 and it fits perfectly.,84140,4
84141,"The stamp, fabric, length and width are good.",84141,4
84141,I would recommend it.,84141,4

84142,and I like it.,84142,4
84144,Slightly bigger than expected.,84144,4

84145,"I wish the flared part were a little flatter instead of so much of a dome, if that makes sense.",84145,4
84145,"Otherwise, I love them.",84145,4
84146,It is great for my insulin pump,84146,4
84148,Just a little smaller then expected,84148,4
84149,"Very pretty dress, unfortunately it runs small.",84149,4
84149,"Arrived in a timely manner, no shipping complaints.",84149,4
84150,Size was good but the midriff was longer than I am.,84150,4
84151,It`s a fine wallet.,84151,4
84151,"For me though, it`s just about a half inch too wide, not thick but wide.",84151,4
84151,"All in all, it is a well made and high quality wallet.",84151,4

84153,"I am 5'9 and 180 lbs and ordered a medium, which fit well except for the length.",84153,4
84153,I have a long stomach and would have preferred an extra inch or too.,84153,4
84153,"The fabric that drapes in the front is great for the days I feel bloated, but is a bit much sometimes.",84153,4
84153,"I think it would look better if my B cup were a C or D, to balance the amount of material.",84153,4
84153,"All in all, this is a great shirt for work.",84153,4
84153,"I like that I can change the ""dressiness"" factor just with jewelry.",84153,4
84153,My favorite combination is medium gray slacks and a colorful chunky necklace.,84153,4
84154,I think it may be me on this one.,84154,4
84154,"I gained some ""winter weight"" which prevented me from being able to get into a large.",84154,4
84154,I am going to keep it.,84154,4
84154,"It is very cute ,so I refuse to throw it away ... to the gym I go :)",84154,4
84155,These were a big hit at the Yacht Rock Review Purple Rain concert.,84155,4
84155,I do wish the manufacturer had included a cardboard band inside to give some rigidity in shipping because they were misshapen with creases.,84155,4
84156,"The only downside is, it is really see through.",84156,4
84156,This probably won't bother everyone.,84156,4
84156,I just prefer not to have to worry about what I wear under something.,84156,4
84156,"Other than that, this is cute.",84156,4
84157,"Very nice, it fits great, no padding or anything in the bust which is ok with me.",84157,4
84157,If you need or want support this is not your suit.,84157,4
84157,But for relaxation and hiding tummy issues it's a winner.,84157,4
84157,"I'm 5'2,  150 lbs, 36DD, apple body.",84157,4
84158,Nice long sleeve tshirt,84158,4
84159,My only issue is I ordered a small and I got a medium.,84159,4
84159,They still got but a little big.,84159,4
84159,They aren't  see through!,84159,4
84160,"Not the strongest, most durable glasses but cheap and great for me.",84160,4
84160,I lose/break glasses on a regular basis so I don't spend much on them.,84160,4
84160,Will probably buy more.,84160,4
84161,Slightly wide but my son is skinny.,84161,4
84161,Had some loose threads prior to washing too.,84161,4
84162,I especially like shirts of this material because they don't shrink.,84162,4
84162,The only downside is that it does run small.,84162,4
84162,I saw another review saying to size up so I went with a 2X for my son and it fit.,84162,4
84162,He prefers an XL and this 2X fit more like a large IMO.,84162,4
84162,In any case its a great shirt for the quality and price.,84162,4
84163,Too big but looked awesome.,84163,4
84163,He will grow into,84163,4
84165,I'm petite so it could be shorter but it will work for my costume party.,84165,4
84166,Very nice product fits well on my daughters wrist,84166,4
84167,"Worth the $, only 2 problems: the pink beads would be MUCH cuter in red, and there are tiny wire ""hoops"" that scratch your wrist.",84167,4
84167,I think it can be easily fixed with plyers,84167,4
84168,"Nice dress for the price, good fit and a fun, flirty design!",84168,4
84168,"I REALLY love the neckline - its flattering but not too revealing which is something I struggle to find, especially in this price range.",84168,4
84168,"I'm 5'8"" and wear a size 6 bottom, 8 top (depending on brand) and its a nice length, fits well through bust and waist.",84168,4
84168,Dress is not exceptional quality but is GREAT for the price!,84168,4
84168,I purchased this for a bachelorette weekend and think it will be perfect for a night out!,84168,4
84170,I will keep anyway even thought its pretty big on me.,84170,4
84171,Ring is actually a lot larger than it looks,84171,4
84172,My Son loves this shirt.,84172,4
84172,He wants to wear it all the time we have had it sense Christmas and it has stood up to lots of washing which is nice.,84172,4
84172,We felt this fit a bit large.,84172,4
84172,He will have room to grow into it.,84172,4
84172,I think it would be nice to have toddler sizes too.,84172,4
84174,"I've had this for awhile, still in near perfect condition.",84174,4
84174,Fits all my cards and money.,84174,4
84174,But I don't need to!,84174,4
84175,Would be 5 stars if the strap keeper wasn't so close to the buckle.,84175,4
84175,I added the rubber floating keeper from my Suunto to give the band a cleaner look.,84175,4
84175,"NOTE: I don't have the actual watch attached to the band yet so once the watch is on the strap, the amount of extra strap could be minimal enough for the onboard keepers to be 100% effective.",84175,4
84176,Beautiful bag but they gave me the wrong color that was not in their description.,84176,4
84176,I wanted brown but they gave me pink.,84176,4
84176,"However, the bag is just the right size and is easy to carry around!",84176,4
84177,As expected in all regards.,84177,4
84178,Looks great but it's a bit larger then expected,84178,4
84179,How awesome our wooden sunglasses.,84179,4
84179,I got this because I wanted something a little bit different that no one really had around here.,84179,4
84179,I like the style of the wayfarers but I don't want to be like everyone else and get the exact same kind.,84179,4
84179,When I was in Hawaii I noticed people had wooden sunglasses and I thought they're pretty awesome so I started doing some research.,84179,4
84179,I picked up these because they're made of bamboo which I thought was even more awesome very stylish and yet very different at the same time.,84179,4
84179,It was a little off putting that these arrived in just a plastic baggie but they did include carrying bag and a microfiber cloth.,84179,4
84179,I was little hesitant because I thought that maybe damage but they weren't thankfully.,84179,4
84179,When you first pull out the glasses You can feel the smoothness in that bamboo the legs are made out you can tell legitimately that they are made of real bamboo.,84179,4
84179,The frames fit perfectly around my face which is generally hard because it's not easy to find frames that my nose.,84179,4
84179,Overall I am very satisfied with this product and will probably end up buying another pair but in a different style.,84179,4
84179,So if you're looking for something a little bit different but not over-the-top just to stand out these are the ticket.,84179,4
84179,I received this item a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation of the product.,84179,4
84179,These are my opinions and observations which have not influenced in anyway.,84179,4
84182,A little short for a dress but with leggings would be great.,84182,4
84182,I bought as a lounge around the house on the weekends but it's nicer than expected for the price so I expect to wear it out!,84182,4
84183,"The colors and fit were as expected, and It came quickly in the mail.",84183,4
84183,My only issue is the clingy fit of the cardigan.,84183,4
84183,"But, that makes sense as it is made with 50% polyester.",84183,4
84183,It also had a couple of loose strings.,84183,4
84183,Overall it seems to be a great product..,84183,4
84183,I bought the multicolored cardigan as well.,84183,4
84183,"Like both, already planning on what to wear them with.",84183,4
84186,So I'm 5ft even and weigh 165lbs and got an XXL to go with my Marvin the Martian costume.,84186,4
84186,"The fabric is pretty stretchy and I honestly could've gotten an XL, the waist band was a little loose around my tummy so it slid a bit but I didn't mind it because I was wearing a skirt over it.",84186,4
84186,"And they are not see through, so even better!",84186,4
84187,The size ran very big...,84187,4
84187,I would order a size down next time..,84187,4
84191,It was just too big for my purpose.,84191,4
84191,I own several Vera Bradley bags.,84191,4
84192,They look beautiful and delicate.,84192,4
84193,Good but too small,84193,4
84194,"It was made in China and their larger tops are made for the larger Chinese women, not American women.",84194,4
84195,Great product feel and fit are excellent!,84195,4
84195,Only complaint I have is that the stitching at the y came undone on one of mine so it rides back and forth.,84195,4
84196,Perfect under shorter skirts for a little extra coverage.,84196,4
84197,Everything I wear is a size 32 but these were still a bit too big in the waist.,84197,4
84197,Easy fix with a belt.,84197,4
84198,"Thin material, good for layering or alone.",84198,4
84198,"Pockets are more like folds in the fabric, or just decoration.",84198,4
84198,"Looks cute on, with leggings or pants, not alone to short.",84198,4
84199,It fit kinda small but it was still pretty good,84199,4
84201,"Arrived on time, very pretty and sturdy.",84201,4
84202,"The bra was really padded and gave it an unnatural, unattractive look.",84202,4
84204,Fits nicely and very sexy,84204,4
84205,The slip is a little tight but good as an evening dress after a day in the sun,84205,4
84206,I really like this little purse.,84206,4
84206,It's small and stylish and I love the smell of genuine leather!,84206,4
84206,"It perfectly fits my credit cards, cash, change and my iPhone 6 in an Otterbox commuter case.",84206,4
84206,My only complaint is that it doesn't fit much else.,84206,4
84206,"If I try to squeeze my keys or a lip gloss into it, it's really hard to button closed.",84206,4
84206,"It's a nice clutch, but don't but it if you're looking for more a of purse.",84206,4
84207,"The beads on the mala are beautiful, a deep amethyst purple.",84207,4
84207,They are semi- translucent and reflect light beautifully.,84207,4
84207,"The mala is well made, seems very durable.",84207,4
84207,I have worn it as a necklace and wrapped around my wrist and received many compliments.,84207,4
84207,The only complaint I have is that the peace sign charm is just snapped on.,84207,4
84207,I ended up taking it apart and adding it to the mala with a silver connector ring.,84207,4
84207,It looks much classier this way.,84207,4
84207,"Otherwise, it is a beautiful mala for the price.",84207,4
84209,Super cute and stretch material.,84209,4
84209,U can wear a tank top under it.,84209,4
84211,"Very good material, design and color, just ordered a wrong size, I used to be M, but I'm going to order an S.",84211,4
84214,The shirt itself is very nice--great quality.,84214,4
84214,I loved everything about it except for how tiny it was.,84214,4
84214,"I normally wear a small, and the medium I ordered was way too small.",84214,4
84214,It was too tight and too short.,84214,4
84214,Are these shirts made for teenagers?,84214,4
84216,"As described and looks great and was priced very low so all in all I'm happy with it, just with the back/bottom was a little fuller, as you can see in the picture its not a full bottom, but at the same time not a thong so it's takes a bit getting used to.",84216,4
84216,but still a nice purchase,84216,4
84218,Great laces thus far - they've been through a couple months of wildland firefighting.,84218,4
84218,They seem to be easier on my boot eyelets than stock laces.,84218,4
84218,"Loses color in the dirt, but that's to be expected!",84218,4
84219,I ordered one size up per reviews so fit was perfect.,84219,4
84219,Really pretty bra especially for the price.,84219,4
84219,FYI my order was shipped from China.,84219,4
84219,I didn't notice the long lead time when I added the item to my shopping cart.,84219,4
84219,"However, I was pleasantly surprised that it only took a little over a week to receive.",84219,4
84219,My Amazon order confirmation said item would be received approximately 1 month after ordering.,84219,4
84219,*Update: I wore bra today and it was slightly uncomfortable.,84219,4
84219,I still will wear because I love the look.,84219,4
84220,Length is amazing for those of us with long legs; straps are not attached to the back of dress so therefore it is completely open back and beautiful; the dress is very sheer yes...however for swimsuit cover up or even to wear a slip underneath the skirt part would fix that problem super easily.,84220,4
84220,"Would not recommend for anyone under 5'6"" unless you plan on having it altered.",84220,4
84220,Would also not recommend to anyone under at LEAST a B cup or it'll be way too loose up top.,84220,4
84221,"If your size is M, request L",84221,4
84222,It's a nice dress for the price.,84222,4
84222,"The lining underneath is really short, and so that kind of looks strange, but overall, I am pleased that I bought this.",84222,4
84223,Great fabric and design.,84223,4
84224,"It is a nice fabric but it is slippery, make the headscarf on top slippery",84224,4
84225,"Nice sweater, material not as soft, a little stiff, but will go well with jeans, or casual wear.",84225,4
84226,"After the purchase of this product I got lots of compliments from friends & others, looks good, fits well and I loved it.",84226,4
84227,Love this and the Bohemian look!,84227,4
84228,This dress is great.,84228,4
84228,Although the top is see through mesh with cups to his your boobies.,84228,4
84229,"Very cute, a little big for my daughter but that means she'll fit in it through the winter",84229,4
84230,"A little small, go up a size for sure",84230,4
84232,"Ordered a small, it was a little shorter than I expected but definitely not a crop top.",84232,4
84232,Hits right at my waist.,84232,4
84232,"(I am 5'9"" and 130 pounds for reference).",84232,4
84232,"Overall, an adorable top.",84232,4
84233,Has a larger fit than normal.,84233,4
84233,Material is a little thin but overall good for the price.,84233,4
84234,Holds the body really well,84234,4
84235,Love the shoes but however they are a bit bigger then what I need.,84235,4
84235,I will still use them.,84235,4
84236,Love it but is smaller than expected,84236,4
84237,These sun hats fit well.,84237,4
84237,This is the second hat I bought so that we will be able to just keep one in the diaper bag for unplanned outdoor outings.,84237,4
84237,The only warning I'd give is that I suspect these hats run large.,84237,4
84237,My 40 percentile 8 month old is wearing the 0-6 M hat and I suspect will be able to for several months more.,84237,4
84239,Oversized to cover ears completely.,84239,4
84239,"If you hate having cold ears, buy these, just do it.",84239,4
84239,They don't mess up my hair either.,84239,4
84240,I was expecting a sweater but I still like it,84240,4
84241,My son loves wearing these!,84241,4
84242,Chain color changed after first wear.,84242,4
84243,Great material and fits comfortably.,84243,4
84244,These were originally recommended by a foot doctor because of my plantar facadiasce.,84244,4
84244,I've used them continuously for many years with good results.,84244,4
84245,"Exactly as described but to small for my hubbies size 8 melon, and to stiff to be comfortable for me.",84245,4
84246,Fits great and made of nice matierals,84246,4
84247,"I'm 5""1, 106 pounds, usually wear XS clothes and this bottom wouldn't even go past half way my tights...",84247,4
84247,Size S is certainly kids size.,84247,4
84247,"The style is great however, will order a bigger size!",84247,4
84248,They are cute but really big.,84248,4
84248,I ordered the 6-12mo size and they are huge compared to my daughters foot.,84248,4
84248,Hopefully they will shrink to fit.,84248,4
84249,"The fit is great around the neck, it is not heavy.",84249,4
84249,The color of the stone is the same as in the picture and it came with a matching set of earrings.,84249,4
84250,"Wish it were a little smaller, if you come right out of the shower it does not absorb water well, but overall feels like being wrapped in a fluffy blanket.",84250,4
84250,I really like the pockets...,84250,4
84251,yo yo bruh thee sunglas look rely cleean thats a bet 100,84251,4
84252,A little see through but super cute,84252,4
84253,A very pretty shirt but needs a cami underneath it and the white but is really ivory.,84253,4
84253,I ordered the xl based on the size chart and it's fine but a L would've been better.,84253,4
84253,I normally wear a size 10.,84253,4
84255,"These readers a good value at ~$10, but I wouldn't spend much more for them.",84255,4
84255,"They have decent lenses, and are flexible, but have also bent out of shape a bit, so probably aren't really quality memory metal.",84255,4
84255,"In addition, the hinges are very tight, making them difficult to open and close without flexing the frame, so the likelihood of them keeping their shape over time (and not breaking) is pretty low.",84255,4
84255,But they work for now and the price is great.,84255,4
84255,"The case is nicely made, but a bit too small for the glasses, so it's sometimes hard to stuff them in and get the case closed.",84255,4
84255,"Again, fine for the price, but I'm glad I didn't spend any more on this product.",84255,4
84255,Edit 9/1/16:  These held up pretty well for a couple of months before a lens popped out and got lost while I was mowing the lawn.,84255,4
84255,"The frame is actually still in good shape, which I can't say for my many other pairs of readers, including flexies and Magnavisions, that lasted no longer than these.",84255,4
84255,If I ever find the lens again (not likely given my yard is 4 acres) I'd be able to pop the lens back in and they'd probably last a few more months.,84255,4
84255,"Given the price, I'm going to buy another pair..

My willingness to buy these again will depend on how long they last.",84255,4
84256,"Good color, just what my wife wanted.",84256,4
84257,Great print and overall design.,84257,4
84257,"It does fit a little too snug, but still a great t shirt!",84257,4
84258,"looks expensive, holding up well after wearing everyday for a week",84258,4
84259,It's very pretty but runs a little small.,84259,4
84260,"It looks cuter than I expected, but for a medium it's somewhat small.",84260,4
84260,I normally but smalls that give me more room than this top.,84260,4
84260,"Luckily I'm planning to lose 5 lbs, at which time I think it will fit perfect.",84260,4
84261,It was a little small but it fits pretty well so I'm pleased with it,84261,4
84262,First kilt I've owned and I loved it.,84262,4
84262,Measured by waist at 42 inches and got the size 42 and it fit perfect.,84262,4
84262,Tightened the straps on the side a bit to make fit a bit tighter.,84262,4
84262,Can't wait to wear for wading while fishing or kayaking.,84262,4
84262,Will definitely get another in a different color at some point,84262,4
84263,Met expectations as I needed a size 19 neck,84263,4
84264,I love these pants.,84264,4
84264,They fit great and feel like they are well made.,84264,4
84264,Two issues I have are 1) they have permanent creases where they were folded in package and on the creases they are faded slightly.,84264,4
84264,2) they started fading after the first wash and now after only four washes they are faded to the point they look years old the black parts look gray the rest of the colors look dull.,84264,4
84264,They were nice and bold when I first got them.,84264,4
84264,Now for me the colors fading isn't a deal breaker just a little disaponting.,84264,4
84264,The pants still look good and are comfortable.,84264,4
84265,I bought this dress for my 21st birthday in red and it's amazing!,84265,4
84265,I'm a size 14 in dresses and I ordered a medium.,84265,4
84265,The material is stretchy and it really hugs my figure.,84265,4
84265,It's sexy yet sophisticated which is my style :) and for so cheap I really can't complain!,84265,4
84266,"The dress is overall a great dress,  and it me everywhere except the straps!",84266,4
84266,They are not adjustable so the dress sat right under my armpits and made it uncomfortable.,84266,4
84266,"If only the straps were adjustable, I would have kept the dress.",84266,4
84266,"I'm exchanging it for a larger dress, and hoping that the fit is still good.",84266,4
84267,This product looked very small when I opened it.,84267,4
84267,Once I went to try it on it stretches nicely and is good quality material.,84267,4
84267,Would definitely purchase again!,84267,4
84268,My mom loved it,84268,4
84269,"Fits a little large, but otherwise very pretty for my little 5 yr old mermaid.",84269,4
84270,"My daughter was very satisfied, said they were comfortable.",84270,4
84271,I had to size up about 3 sizes (I got an XXL and I generally wear a small).,84271,4
84271,If I had gotten the size I generally wear it would have fit my 10 year old daughter.,84271,4
84272,Length is just right  of what I need for both my boots and walking shoes.,84272,4
84273,For an extra large it was a little snug.,84273,4
84273,I like it though,84273,4
84274,It looks good and the low tinkling draws attention.,84274,4
84274,So far it hasn't tarnished and I have been wearing it for two months...even in the shower.,84274,4
84275,Fabric was quality and color was vibrant.,84275,4
84275,Back length of the blouse was longer than I expected but the overall blouse fit as expected.,84275,4
84276,Like my new pants a lot but wish the waist was elastic.,84276,4
84276,I'm planning to wear these to work just hope they are comfortable enough.,84276,4
84276,Pants look fabulous though!,84276,4
84277,Beautiful dress however its small I am size small I had to sent it back for a bigger size.,84277,4
84278,I got the purse with no leopard print.,84278,4
84278,"So far there is only one con to this purse, and that is the fabric inside smelled like rotting eggs.",84278,4
84278,I'm hoping with some air and deodorizer it'll disappear.,84278,4
84278,"Over all it's really cute, and roomy on the inside.",84278,4
84279,"Unit is approximately what you would expect at this price point, but I would not recommend this for anyone seeking a good quality rosary.",84279,4
84279,"However, for a temporary or small inexpensive gift this would suffice.",84279,4
84280,"Thought it would be a little more A line, but i can work with it.",84280,4
84280,I can add a tacking or two in the back where it seems to gather a bit.,84280,4
84280,But i am pleased with the purchase.,84280,4
84281,Not as quite as I expected in material...,84281,4
84281,But still a nice look.,84281,4
84281,Not in love ...,84281,4
84282,These are nice for the price!!,84282,4
84282,The fit/comfort is perfect.,84282,4
84282,"The lenses are very dark, but not too dark.",84282,4
84282,"The box that they come in is NOT wood, however, but it will make a nice holder.",84282,4
84282,"The arms do appear very like Bamboo, and, in general, a really classic-look to the styling.",84282,4
84283,"it looks more spacious in the picture... the side where your makeup goes doesn't open all the way and i guess i could cut it to where it does, but i don't want to have to ruin it.",84283,4
84284,"Creat product however it fell just one time and the lens popped out, Whoops ~",84284,4
84285,"cute, lightweight, slim fit",84285,4
84286,This thing is sweet.,84286,4
84286,"Minimal as heck,  holds 10 nicely folded bills plus two cards,  perfects price.",84286,4
84286,Magnet could be stronger but overall is exactly what I wanted,84286,4
84287,"Got as a gift for my daughter, she loves it.",84287,4
84287,Is  little smaller than expected.,84287,4
84288,"Looks like white gold, maybe shinier.",84288,4
84288,"Way too wide for my husband to wear though, and shinier than he likes in a ring.",84288,4
84288,Decided to go with eight mm width and a brushed finish.,84288,4
84288,"Thought about keeping it for myself because it's such a nice ring for the money, but I'm not a huge fan of thumb rings ;)",84288,4
84289,Way to small not even close to a XXL,84289,4
84292,Grandson is excited to wear them.,84292,4
84293,Bought this for my son's snow sports.,84293,4
84294,They're  great I just wish the labradorite  looked more like labradorite  and not just black,84294,4
84295,Good shirt for the price.,84295,4
84295,It's loose not form fitting.,84295,4
84295,Lace sleeves held up in washer dryer just fine.,84295,4
84297,It's smaller than I thought but it holds everything I carry in a purse.,84297,4
84298,The dark gray has a slight greenish tint to it and the logo feels a little like an old iron-on (but appears to be much better quality).,84298,4
84299,This is such a pretty necklace.,84299,4
84299,I cannot wait to give it as a gift.,84299,4
84299,Arrived in a neat little package inside a bigger package.,84299,4
84300,Very basic and simple all black.,84300,4
84301,I purchased this hat for a cruise.,84301,4
84301,The hat did a wonderful job at protecting me from the sun in the Caribbean.,84301,4
84301,I did not get a sunburn on my face.,84301,4
84301,"I was heavily made fun of for having a ""granny"" hat.",84301,4
84301,It was worth the comments for not having to suffer from sundurn.,84301,4
84301,The hat held up great even after dropping it in the ocean.,84301,4
84301,"It held up, dried quickly,  and didn't lose its shape.",84301,4
84303,The shipment took a little longer than I would have liked but the product was great...so all in all...well worth it.,84303,4
84303,I would reorder in the future.,84303,4
84305,"First and foremost, the description is inaccurate, as no micro fiber bag is included, just a set of glasses in a plastic bag, inside of a paper envelope.",84305,4
84305,Hopefully you already have a case or bag to protect them.,84305,4
84305,"Secondly, it's not apparent from the photo in the description, but the lenses are not a uniform color at all.",84305,4
84305,The top third of the lens is much darker than the bottom two thirds.,84305,4
84305,It's not a subtle shift either.,84305,4
84305,"It's very dark at the top, and very light tint on the bottom.",84305,4
84305,It can be a little disconcerting until you learn how to angle your head for optimum viewing.,84305,4
84305,"I guess for $7, and the fact that they showed up 48 hours after ordering, I'll just shut up and post a review.",84305,4
84305,Edit to Update: I have been using them the last 2 days for my pre-dawn ride in to work and again on the sunny ride home.,84305,4
84305,"Due to the different tints, they are working like a charm for my night and day riding.",84305,4
84305,I'm going to order more and hope that they actually come with the listed storage bag.,84305,4
84306,Pretty but way  too small.,84306,4
84308,Works OK so far.,84308,4
84308,Doesn't set off metal detectors.,84308,4
84309,Good quality but does not fit well.,84309,4
84311,Top is really great!,84311,4
84311,However it's made of synthetic materials and runs small.,84311,4
84311,"So buy a size or two larger, and you won't face any issues.",84311,4
84311,"I am normally a medium, rarely a large.",84311,4
84311,"I bought a large, and it's a little tight.",84311,4
84312,"I will need to have it taken in around the waist, but I was expecting that based on the measurements.",84312,4
84312,I am taking one star off because it is a little see through.,84312,4
84312,You just need to be careful what you wear under it.,84312,4
84312,"However, I do still like it enough that I would buy it again.",84312,4
84313,"I love Genie bras, they fit and they last.",84313,4
84313,Eventually I take the pads out - as in all bras of this type the pads are a pain in the butt to put in and take out for every wash.,84313,4
84313,I've tried other brands but they seem to be cut too small under the arm or around the ribs.,84313,4
84313,Genie Bra is just right for me.,84313,4
84313,"However, ordering these, you must remember this company shipped from China.",84313,4
84313,It took quite a while for delivery.,84313,4
84313,I wish Amazon would mark the items that ship from China or out of the USA in general (most are China).,84313,4
84314,I've really begun loving leggings paired with tunics--I now own several sets in a variety of colors.,84314,4
84314,They's so easy to dress down or up.,84314,4
84315,This set is small and elegant.,84315,4
84315,I had been wearing them for quite a while (About 3 months) and the silver still have not darken like some of the other items that I have bought in the past.,84315,4
84315,The earrings are small and matches nicely with the necklace.,84315,4
84315,"The blue crystal looks good and bright, not super dark like some others.",84315,4
84315,It looks very similar to the one in the picture.,84315,4
84315,The metal chain is fairly thin so you do not feel really cold from the metal when you first put it on.,84315,4
84315,These are a good set of jewelry and overall just have to take good care of it and they will last quite a while.,84315,4
84315,The stones also still have not fallen off which is great.,84315,4
84315,"The prices of this item is superb although the shipping takes a while, however it was on time and in good packaging.",84315,4
84316,"Previous reviews mentioned that these socks ran small, for being listed as men's socks.",84316,4
84316,I bought them knowing this so was pleased that they fit women's shoe sizes 9-10 fine.,84316,4
84316,"Great bargain, compared to paying between $8-$12 for one pair in novelty shops.",84316,4
84316,Art work was acceptable.,84316,4
84316,Not top of the line but had good detail for the price.,84316,4
84317,It is one size fits most.,84317,4
84317,I would say the largest size where the top band fits comfortably would be a 14.,84317,4
84317,It has to be worn high on the waist if you are larger and have larger hips.,84317,4
84317,The material is soft and comfy and perfect for teaching Zumba.,84317,4
84318,The suits fit my husband just fine.,84318,4
84318,He was very proud when he sat in the pulpit Sunday morning.,84318,4
84319,I rarely carry a whole bunch of stuff so this works well to carry the few items I do carry all the time.,84319,4
84319,Kind of wish it held my wallet but it works well without my wallet anyway.,84319,4
84321,It's tiny - laughable really.,84321,4
84321,I got XL and it's about a size 6.,84321,4
84321,"I will wear it, but it won't go near my chest.",84321,4
84321,"I wear a 10 or 12 usually, for instance, in clothes from the Gap.",84321,4
84321,It is a good length though and nice design.,84321,4
84323,"Gets the job done as a boho coin statement necklace for the price, it's cute",84323,4
84324,The material was a little more see-through than I had hoped to but I can just use a slip .,84324,4
84324,It's a beautiful dress !,84324,4
84326,I wear it with shorts because its really mini.,84326,4
84326,For the price I got my monies worth.,84326,4
84326,wore it to beach 3 times already and would wear it again.,84326,4
84326,I can never get the tie to look like the pic though,84326,4
84327,Had a bit of trouble when it arrived.,84327,4
84327,It seemed like a pull over.,84327,4
84327,Took pics and messaged the seller.,84327,4
84327,He didn't seem to understand what the problem was.,84327,4
84327,So I was going to return it.,84327,4
84327,"As I was getting ready to pack it, I had it laid out and looked at it more closely.",84327,4
84327,"Where it should open in the front it was hand sowned up, tight I might say,  so for the heck of it I took a seam cutter and found a piece to start with and got going on it and the front open right up.",84327,4
84327,Now I really like this sweater and wear it a lot.,84327,4
84328,It's cheaply made hence the cheap cost.,84328,4
84328,"Will start to fall apart after a few months/several washings, but for one season, it was cute and super warm.",84328,4
84328,"Got lots of compliments, and the color of the pink in the pic is true",84328,4
84329,Warm and light weight.,84329,4
84329,Wish it fit a little better.,84329,4
84330,Item was exactly as described.,84330,4
84330,Quicker than advertised delivery.,84330,4
84331,"This watch is very classy looking I get compliments, but the strap will not stay engaged under the little loop so it is alway flapping on my arm.",84331,4
84331,But the price it right.,84331,4
84331,I had tp glue a tiny magnet on to stop the flapping.,84331,4
84334,Super comfortable and cute!,84334,4
84336,"Very elegant, professional looking portfolio",84336,4
84337,Functions well strong but light!,84337,4
84338,I bought the small and it was the perfect fit for my tall 3 year old.,84338,4
84339,They are thicker and warmer than I expected but very comfortable and easy to wear with boots.,84339,4
84340,Its really cute and a great price,84340,4
84341,"The large brim is very effective for blocking the sun, but I think the headband part is a bit too big for me.",84341,4
84341,"I'm wearing the heck out of it, though.",84341,4
84342,Very soft and love it just wish it was a little bit bigger,84342,4
84344,"I ordered this on a whim looking for a simple black cardigan with pockets (surprisingly not easy to find, at least for my picky self) it ended up fitting me perfectly.",84344,4
84344,"The material is very light and thin, but it does the job.",84344,4
84344,Its exactly what I needed.,84344,4
84344,"It said one size when I ordered, but if I had to guess I would say it fits like a medium-large.",84344,4
84345,"Based on the sizing listed I ordered large, when they came I received two medium with the pack both sizes fit but I prefer the snug fit of the medium.",84345,4
84345,The quality can be compared to some similar ones I also bought from Victoria secrets.,84345,4
84345,Will buy medium next time.,84345,4
84346,"High-quality leggings, but the fit was somewhat small.",84346,4
84347,"Wear these in low-light when I play golf, and they are perfect.",84347,4
84347,"The heavier frame blocks wind, which is good for me because I have dry eyes.",84347,4
84347,"The temples are somewhat long if you are smaller person (5'9"") like me.",84347,4
84351,Read that this shirt ran small so I purchased a large.,84351,4
84351,It fit a bit loose (could've got a medium)but looks great!,84351,4
84351,It's lightweight fabric and very comfortable.,84351,4
84352,I bought these for my daughter's school uniform.,84352,4
84352,Her socks are the only outlet for nonconformity.,84352,4
84352,They are men's socks.,84352,4
84352,"However, she is able to wear them with her size 8 foot.",84352,4
84352,The colors are vivid and really pop next to her burgundy and black uniform.,84352,4
84353,"Nice shoes, if only they were a little wider.",84353,4
84353,OR maybe i should have bought them on 10.5 size!,84353,4
84355,Great for cooler swims.,84355,4
84355,You will need help getting out of it if you have broad shoulders,84355,4
84356,Shear in the back.,84356,4
84358,nice for small children,84358,4
84359,These do not run small as a lot have mentioned.,84359,4
84359,"I am 5'5"", 34D, and a solid 8.",84359,4
84359,"The Hoodie is pretty baggy, more of a relaxed fit.",84359,4
84359,"Not as the image depicts, almost fitted.",84359,4
84359,"It thought I would get to wear it out on the weekends, put in it is more of a lounge fit for me.",84359,4
84359,I may have to reorder the small.,84359,4
84361,I would prefer clear only.,84361,4
84361,The colors are fun but a bit impractical.,84361,4
84362,Lots of color options and alternating options.,84362,4
84362,The charging is easy.,84362,4
84362,And they last a long time in the day.,84362,4
84362,Lights are bright and colorful.,84362,4
84364,"I like the shirt, it is cute.",84364,4
84364,I am not crazy about a high/low style shirt.,84364,4
84364,"The print is adorable, but please now the back is longer than the front, which I should have known when I purchased the shirt.",84364,4
84364,It is cute and casual though and a nice value for the price.,84364,4
84365,Looked good on my boyfriends big dome.,84365,4
84365,He said it was comfortable and warm.,84365,4
84366,"My boyfriend loves it, he is a kid at heart.",84366,4
84366,downside is that it is a little too big and putting in his cards and things like that are a bit of a problem.,84366,4
84366,Sometimes he has to take some time getting it into the slots.,84366,4
84367,It fit they way I wanted.,84367,4
84368,Material is great...feels great but a little large in cut.,84368,4
84370,I purchased these for my daughter.,84370,4
84370,They do appear to have sterling silver posts as her ears haven't been irritated during wear.,84370,4
84370,The small pearls are the perfect size for a girl and they look fantastic.,84370,4
84370,I do recommend and think this is a great value!,84370,4
84371,Was stretchier than I thought it would be.,84371,4
84371,Go with a size smaller than you normally would.,84371,4
84372,"I wear a size 12, but decided to order a 14 to be sure it fit.",84372,4
84372,"I'm glad I did, because a 12 would've been too snug.",84372,4
84372,"Cute style, so I look forward to wearing it this spring/summer season.",84372,4
84372,"Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase.",84372,4
84373,"I'm 5'5"", 147lbs 34C and ordered a large in black because I read other reviews saying it ran small.",84373,4
84373,It's too big for me.,84373,4
84373,With the drawstring pulled all the way there's just too much extra fabric draping.,84373,4
84373,I'll be returning & may try a medium.,84373,4
84373,The black is not see through.,84373,4
84373,"Nice fabric, really cute casual dress",84373,4
84374,The only downfall is that with a thin case on my IPhone 6 the pocket is unable to secure it.,84374,4
84375,My daughter loves this sweatshirt!,84375,4
84375,It fit as it should and looks super cute on her!,84375,4
84375,It isn't a heavy hoodie but it fits under her coat or another jacket.,84375,4
84376,"First impression is really good, solid construction on the buckle and the belt quality seems really good so far, can be easily adjusted to fit any size by trimming the belt, ratchet action is solid and smooth and allows for perfect fit vs. holes.",84376,4
84377,A 5T fits my almost 4 year old twins and the 6-9 month fits my 98th percentile 4 month old.,84377,4
84377,"The smell before washing is awful, but it went away.",84377,4
84377,Bought the fire dog set in both sizes.,84377,4
84378,"It is very slim and easy to carry, it slips in your pocket and you forget that it is even there.",84378,4
84378,At the same time it still has enough storage options to carry most anything you would need unless you are just one of those people who crams everything in their wallet and use it as long term storage.,84378,4
84378,The design is perfect for me.,84378,4
84378,"I carry my work ID in the windowed slot for easy identification, along with my drivers license in the second slot.",84378,4
84378,The opposite side carries payment options (debit and credit card).,84378,4
84378,Behind the card sets I keep a blank check on one side and my health insurance card on the other.,84378,4
84378,That leaves the main center pocket for cash and that's all I need.,84378,4
84378,My only complaint with this item would be the leather.,84378,4
84378,It is not the highest quality leather and the color just looks bad in my opinion.,84378,4
84378,"To be fair, the color is exactly how it appears in the photos, it is just too orange/red looking for me and I think it makes it look cheap.",84378,4
84378,"But, I will still be using it as my daily carry.",84378,4
84378,The RFID shield is a great addition but not why I purchased this.,84378,4
84378,"Honestly, it's not something I am concerned with so I just view it as a bonus.",84378,4
84378,"I have no way to test it's functionality though, so I can only trust that it works as advertised.",84378,4
84378,I have not had this product for very long so I am not able to speak to the durability of it in terms of longevity.,84378,4
84378,It seems well constructed as far as I can tell.,84378,4
84378,"However, if I have any problems with that in the future, I will be sure to post an update to this review with any relevant photographs.",84378,4
84378,This is a good product and I would recommend it.,84378,4
84378,"If you considered this review helpful, please mark it as such below so that other people will be able to find it more easily.",84378,4
84378,"I did receive it a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, but that in no way sways my review.",84378,4
84378,"If a product is bad, then I will tell you; and if my opinion changes with more use I will edit my review.",84378,4
84378,"I know how much I depend on these reviews when I am purchasing products for myself, and I work hard to give accurate and helpful advice anytime I review a product.",84378,4
84378,"I say all that because I have to in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsement and Testimonials in Advertising, not because it sways my review in any way.",84378,4
84378,I hope you enjoy this product should you decide to get it.,84378,4
84378,Thanks for reading and happy shopping!,84378,4
84379,My morning heal pain has been dissipating since I started using these.,84379,4
84380,This dress is lovely!,84380,4
84380,It does show more cleavage than most dresses but that can be fixed.,84380,4
84380,It also tends to run a little big.,84380,4
84380,I would go one size down.,84380,4
84380,I got the XXL at first but it was too big which is odd since I'm a 40 bust so I decided to get the XL to compare the fit and the XL fit perfectly.,84380,4
84380,The first picture is the XXL and the second is the XL.,84380,4
84381,Looks just like the picture sleves are short for tall people,84381,4
84382,Came much earlier than expected and looks beautiful!,84382,4
84382,"Only issue is I had to remove the pendant and put it on a separate part of the chain because the way it came, the pendant was right next to the chain and couldn't be moved around, which looked awkward",84382,4
84383,A friend of mine has one and told me it works for him.,84383,4
84383,"I was sceptical, but took a chance.",84383,4
84383,"I don't know how our went, but it works.",84383,4
84383,"For me, it doesn't do away with the pain, but it significantly reduces it.",84383,4
84383,And it really looks nice.,84383,4
84384,Love the dress  but her size 12 was too large so I would  love to exchange for a size 10.,84384,4
84385,These have flash mirror lenses just like the real Dior technologics but they're not exactly like them.,84385,4
84385,The Dior ones reflect about everything but these only reflect certain angles of light but it's real close to the Dior ones.,84385,4
84385,"Either way, I love them and I'm keeping them.",84385,4
84386,These are very pretty and shiny!,84386,4
84386,"A little larger than I thought so I haven't worn them yet, The lever-back seems well made and the metal looks like the finish will hold up well too.",84386,4
84387,Could be sized better,84387,4
84388,Keeps the change where I can get at it.,84388,4
84389,Looked cheap but once I put it on the face I was surprised at how nice it looked and fit.,84389,4
84390,This was a great purchase for traveling this summer.,84390,4
84390,"Based on previous reviews I did not use the side zippers, but it should be noted that they did zip and unzip without issue.",84390,4
84390,"It was big enough to hold everything we needed for a day of sight seeing, but not too bulky.",84390,4
84391,Looks even better on.,84391,4
84393,"Good fit, good construction, good look.",84393,4
84393,"You might need to iron it for a nice, crisp ""official"" look, as the material is soft and tends to slouch a bit.",84393,4
84394,grand daughter loved it but fits a little too snug.,84394,4
84394,I would go up a size for future purchase,84394,4
84395,It is a beautiful top!,84395,4
84395,It was the perfect fit for my neice.,84395,4
84396,"Tight across the shoulders & in the top of the sleeve, but acceptable to wear.",84396,4
84396,Very soft & warm.,84396,4
84397,Pretty purse with plenty of room.,84397,4
84398,Smaller than what I am a custom too.,84398,4
84399,This large size runs small.,84399,4
84401,I'm 5'4 190 lbs and 2XL was a bit big.,84401,4
84401,I wanted something comfy whilst trying to lose the baby weight bit XL would have been fine.,84401,4
84402,Somewhat tight in the shoulders but otherwise a nice looking jacket.,84402,4
84402,Too bad I only got to wear it once (left it in a bar the first night I wore it out),84402,4
84405,I bought this in a large and the top was too big and the bottom two small.,84405,4
84405,I should have gotten a medium since I bought new white bottoms to go with it in the end.,84405,4
84405,All in all it it its a good deal and very cute,84405,4
84406,"Soft, Slinky...not see through..",84406,4
84408,"I loved this top, however it runs very small.",84408,4
84408,I usually take a large or X-large and I couldn't even get my arm in the sleeves.,84408,4
84408,I had to sent it back.,84408,4
84409,"I really like these socks, they are warm and what i like more about it is that they are cotton.",84409,4
84410,"Good quality, very happy with the product.",84410,4
84410,The shine can rub off easily,84410,4
84411,"Good quality but I had to return the first because a large (which usually fits well) was too tight for my tastes... Just a basic white tee, nothing special about the actual shirt.",84411,4
84412,Bought for my 10 year old son.,84412,4
84412,Lasted the whole baseball season with no problems.,84412,4
84413,This bag is a little more shallow than I expected.,84413,4
84413,But it is fantastic as an airplane carry on.,84413,4
84415,The fasteners are cheap,84415,4
84416,"I actually really loved this suit, I am 5'10"" about 170 lbs, D cups, mostly proportioned figure and the 2XL was a little big.",84416,4
84416,"That wasn't the problem, the problem is in the front it flap over a mesh underlining.",84416,4
84416,When I pulled it down it creased strange on the sides making the silhouette look strange.,84416,4
84416,I also felt that keeping that covered would be a problem.,84416,4
84416,"It didn't really work for me, but its an adorable, flattering suit.",84416,4
84417,It's what you expect from a key chain.,84417,4
84418,"small in chest, large the rest",84418,4
84421,"This has worked well now that I am 6 months pregnant, but prior to that it was too small",84421,4
84422,"This is a cute robe for a little girl, however, it is not terry cloth or absorbent.",84422,4
84422,It feels more like fleece.,84422,4
84423,It exceeded my expectations.,84423,4
84423,For the super discounted price this watch is by far the best.,84423,4
84423,I'm very satisfied and planning on buying another SO&CO watch!,84423,4
84423,BTW I have a very thin wrist due to an injury so its very hard for me to find one that fits just right.,84423,4
84423,I would give it a 5 star if they added lighting to it.,84423,4
84424,Holds my jeans up as promised!,84424,4
84424,"It is a little large, but I am only at the beginning of my second trimester so I am sure it will fit better in a few weeks.",84424,4
84424,"I have only used this on one pair of jeans that fit tight in waist before pregnancy, but it did hold them up.",84424,4
84424,Do not buy if you are expecting this to smooth your stomach out.,84424,4
84424,"I have several scars from previous surgeries and was hoping this product would help make them less noticeable and give me a cute pregnancy bump, but unfortunately it does not.",84424,4
84425,Great and fair price,84425,4
84426,Very pretty pattern and colors.,84426,4
84426,"It is moderately comfortable, the material is stiff but may fix its self once its washed.",84426,4
84426,The dress is very short however.,84426,4
84426,It falls above mid thigh.,84426,4
84426,"I am 5' 5"" and 120 lbs and I ordered a medium (a size larger than I normally wear) because of the reviews saying it ran small and it is extremely loose and falls above mid thigh.",84426,4
84426,Definitely something I would wear shorts with or over a bathing suit rather than just as a dress.,84426,4
84427,"This LED light arrived just as I expected, and has already been working flawlessly to keep my watch fully charged.",84427,4
84427,"It is well made, and my only criticism is that the small rubber pad on which the watch rests is not held captive at all, so it could be easy to lose.",84427,4
84427,I suspect that is why it came with an extra pad.,84427,4
84427,"I was not surprised to discover that the bright light, at least in my case, isn't fully covered by my watch when it's being used, so quite a lot of light leaks out around it, so it's not something that can be used on your nightstand at bedtime.",84427,4
84427,Mine has migrated into a closet.,84427,4
84427,"It's great that it has both battery mode and a DC charger mode, so it can be used on the road when you travel.",84427,4
84427,It is certainly worth the $25 I paid.,84427,4
84428,Super cute but still pretty big on my one month old,84428,4
84430,"Like the fit, but due to my size still clingy but with tunics will look fine for winter.",84430,4
84432,"No stretch...came with a hole in it..I hope I can still wear it for awhile, it is cute...company contacted me and offered to replace my tank top even though I told them it wasn't necessary...good people!",84432,4
84433,"The only issue I have with this jacket is that the hood comes unbuttoned very easily, but it is an easy fix with some thread and a needle.",84433,4
84434,These shoes fit a little bit bigger then expected according to the chart but not by much and plus kids tend to go through shoes so.,84434,4
84435,The Easter Bunny brought this to my daughter.,84435,4
84435,I am concerned about the quality.,84435,4
84435,So far (3 wearings) it's done ok.,84435,4
84435,But it feels as if this is one of those necklaces that's not meant to last forever.,84435,4
84435,"At this price, that's alright.",84435,4
84435,"And it is a very different necklace for a little girl, who is usually only presented with Elsa, Hello Kitty, and Minnie Mouse.",84435,4
84436,Not the best but not bad either.,84436,4
84437,Fits nicely but noticing the band might wear out quickly...,84437,4
84437,Besides that I really like this product!,84437,4
84438,This cape worked great for Halloween.,84438,4
84438,We will be able to use it next year if needed.,84438,4
84439,"Comfortable and keeps ""stuff"" separate and dry",84439,4
84440,Cute and very comfortable.,84440,4
84440,Needed for a Halloween costume.,84440,4
84441,These were very cute and comfortable to wear.,84441,4
84441,"I wore them out around town shopping one day (the mall, craft store, and Walmart).",84441,4
84441,No comments on my otherwise naked feet.,84441,4
84441,"One of the toe loops did come loose from my toe, but only a couple of times.",84441,4
84441,"Wearing them very long did cause a little discomfort on my toe, but it was pretty negligible.",84441,4
84441,"I love these sandals, but unfortunately my toddler broke one, so I will have to reorder one.",84441,4
84441,"A reminder: they do come as a single piece, as stated in the product description.",84441,4
84441,But selling them as single pieces is helpful just for my situation.,84441,4
84441,I will definitely purchase this again.,84441,4
84442,"Even though, they fit tight on me, it wasn't an issue I still wore them, and will continue to wear them.",84442,4
84442,"If you want them to fit a little loose, I'd recommend going up a size or two.",84442,4
84443,Tunics with pockets are hard to come by.,84443,4
84443,"This one fits:  I'm between sizes, so order up.",84443,4
84443,A size L is good for my  size 16-18W frame.,84443,4
84443,"This is lovely fabric, washes well, and the pockets are big enough to be functional.",84443,4
84443,"I'm not crazy about the colours offered, but the sale price can't be beaten.",84443,4
84444,Legs are not as long as pictured.,84444,4
84444,Fits more like an American size small.,84444,4
84444,Suggest going up one size for a better fit.,84444,4
84446,"Made cheaply, but its cute, looks just like the picture.",84446,4
84446,"It's easy to bend out of shape, kind of hard to make it fit your arm once again.. but I like mine still, so that's good.",84446,4
84447,"The outfit is cute, however it was shorter than I had anticipated!",84447,4
84447,Im a little conservative for most ladies.,84447,4
84447,Sad to send back!,84447,4
84447,Got it weeks before anticipated.,84447,4
84448,"true to size on arrival, but shrunk a lot upon washing.",84448,4
84448,order up a size for accurate fit.,84448,4
84449,The fit is a little tight so go a size larger.,84449,4
84449,Otherwise I love this shirt!,84449,4
84450,Love the marble accent on these sunglasses.,84450,4
84450,"They are on the larger side, so if you have a small face they can look a little comical.",84450,4
84451,I want more ...,84451,4
84453,"Packaging was great, came in a bubble wrap-lined bag and with a convenient pouch!",84453,4
84453,"I love them because the screw on ball is also a stone, not just a plain old metal ball like 90% of the belly rings out there.",84453,4
84453,"This is an awesome set, ESPECIALLY for the price.",84453,4
84453,All the colors are just as pictured.,84453,4
84453,"Most cheap ones turn my belly button green and the gold tarnishes, so I will update after wearing this one for a while!",84453,4
84453,But even if that happens..,84453,4
84453,"I paid less than $1 a piece, I wasn't expecting much :)",84453,4
84454,Can wear with heels or flats,84454,4
84455,"Cute, Girly, Shiny, Perfect.",84455,4
84456,They are a perfect  fit,84456,4
84458,"It wasn't as form fitting as I had expected, but over all I really like this shirt.",84458,4
84459,Nice dress and fit.,84459,4
84460,This belt or gorgeous i love it.,84460,4
84461,IT WAS A SMALL FITTING 1X It was fitting let a meduim I do not have a chest at all.,84461,4
84461,I wear a 1x.,84461,4
84461,the quality was good,84461,4
84462,Lovely piece providing style and max comfort EXCEPT the sleeves are a different fabric and I would have preferred all French terry.,84462,4
84462,I don't like the seam in the upper arm.,84462,4
84463,"They do seem to run a little big in the waist, but that whats belts are for!",84463,4
84464,Wish they had more colors than black.,84464,4
84465,I normally wear a L/XL (busty) and I ordered a 2XL to be safe.. it's still pretty tight but wearable.,84465,4
84465,Fabric is thin but everything looks as expected!,84465,4
84467,I have purchased these for myself and two friends.,84467,4
84467,We all love them.,84467,4
84467,Perfect light weight vest.,84467,4
84467,Looks especially nice tied at waist.,84467,4
84467,I ordered smaller size for all of us.,84467,4
84468,Just don't screw too tight,84468,4
84469,Color was lighter in person than what's shown on site,84469,4
84470,Got what I expected except the color was off due to prior bleaching of tee shirt,84470,4
84471,Arrived earlier than said.,84471,4
84471,Look and feel like good quality!,84471,4
84471,"Nice prices , got 3 for like $15.00.",84471,4
84472,"Cute, and just right for the holidays.",84472,4
84472,"Purchased two of these for my nephews, it was just what I was looking for.",84472,4
84473,Coats are great and my grandsons love them- even when it's not raining.,84473,4
84474,Purchased this for my daughter who just loves infinity scarves.,84474,4
84474,"This is a nice, lightweight material that she can wear even in the warmer weather.",84474,4
84474,The colors were bright and crisp.,84474,4
84474,My daughter has worn this quite a few times and it has not snagged or ripped.,84474,4
84474,"Overall, I think this was a great purchase.",84474,4
84475,"Luv the style of shirt ,it's a little small in the upper arms.",84475,4
84475,Not much room to move.,84475,4
84476,"Pretty dress, fit a little big on chest area.",84476,4
84476,"My daughter had to keep pulling it up constantly, had to send it to seamstress.",84476,4
84476,Seamstress put straps on dress and that worked out fine.,84476,4
84476,reluctant to ask for return due to previous experience with seller.,84476,4
84477,"Arrived quickly, fits as expected.",84477,4
84477,I like the color and the material.,84477,4
84478,"I ordered 5 charms to get their ""FREE Shipping on orders over $49"" but they still charge for shipping!",84478,4
84478,Maybe it's for prime?,84478,4
84478,The shipping was fast and correct item!,84478,4
84478,I was hoping the diamonds would have more sparkles...it's okay for the price!,84478,4
84479,"These fit my wider face, but the quality/finish isn't what I'd hoped.",84479,4
84480,I originally ordered the small but it was too tight to comfortably wear.,84480,4
84480,so I returned and ordered the medium and it is a great fit.,84480,4
84480,I look forward to wearing it as it gets closer to Christmas!,84480,4
84482,I purchased this M dress for my Mom.,84482,4
84482,The quality is good although a bit thin but still I love it.,84482,4
84484,This shirt is super comfortable!!,84484,4
84484,"I actually ended up buying a different color after this one, because I liked the fit.",84484,4
84484,"The straps are super cute, and the flare on the belly is flattering.",84484,4
84484,"I wish it was slightly longer, but other than that, Great shirt!",84484,4
84485,I really like this pj; so hard to find 100 percent cotton!,84485,4
84485,It did have a very weird odor when it arrived; nothing that washing with Tide and extra rinse cycle didn't fix!,84485,4
84486,This is a little longer than I expected.,84486,4
84486,It's a long chain that comes down to between my breasts.,84486,4
84486,"Also, the mirror fell out the first time I wore it.",84486,4
84486,But a little glue fixed it up and I do still like the looks of it.,84486,4
84486,The pendant itself is probably about and inch and a half to two inches long.,84486,4
84489,This dress was purchased to wear on a cruise.,84489,4
84489,"It is definitely clingy, but seems to be the perfect length.",84489,4
84490,My son loves these pants FYI MY 6'6 SON WHOSE 180# LENGTH GOOD.,84490,4
84490,MINIMAL SHRINKAGE I gave measurements because I ordered xxl.,84490,4
84490,So they run small.,84490,4
84491,"Nice fit, very comfortable",84491,4
84492,Love this purse and been looking for something like it for the last little while until now.,84492,4
84492,If it's a Galaxy 7 and small mini wallets perfectly.,84492,4
84492,It has two compartments.,84492,4
84492,The handle on the purse is slightly thin and feels very fragile but otherwise a great item.,84492,4
84493,I really like the dress and the color is really pretty.,84493,4
84493,"The only slight problem is that I needed to get a large because I am tall but normally I would get a medium in this, but I didn't want it to be short.",84493,4
84493,Since I got the large it hangs really low in the back where you could probably see your bra if wear one with this so I think I'm going to wear a bando under it.,84493,4
84493,"But overall, LOVE the dress and really recommend the color, makes you look tan.",84493,4
84494,Really regret this .,84494,4
84494,"Even though I took a size bigger, it was way too small.",84494,4
84494,"Very pretty, great material but comes really small.",84494,4
84494,The xl fits my daughter whose a S/M.,84494,4
84494,"I tried to find it elsewhere in a bigger size, but couldn't.",84494,4
84496,The material is cheap but looks and feel pretty solid although the glass brilliant is not pretty well glued to the earring base.,84496,4
84496,Other than that is a nice piece of fashion jewerly,84496,4
84498,"The top is a bit snug, but the outfit is adorable!",84498,4
84500,Only thing I didn't like about this jacket is that half the patches are Velcro and don't stick on very well.,84500,4
84500,"Other than that, fits great and is made well.",84500,4
84501,Tight in the tummy,84501,4
84503,"I love this dress, is perfect for me",84503,4
84504,"** I received this product at a discounted rate in return for an honest review **

This is a very nice set.",84504,4
84504,"They are thick, so they would be appropriate for a man or woman who was interested in chain jewelry.",84504,4
84504,It is the type of chain that lays flat.,84504,4
84504,Darker shade of silver.,84504,4
84504,It was very nice.,84504,4
84504,They are well built and should last a long time.,84504,4
84504,"They are heavy, so if you are looking for delicate pieces this is not for you.",84504,4
84504,I have very small wrists so the bracelet was huge on my arm.,84504,4
84504,But it would work on my ankle well enough.,84504,4
84505,Amazing price and nice and soft.,84505,4
84508,Front has a little to much room but still makes the wife happy,84508,4
84509,"Of course, the cap has velcro on the back to tighten as needed, but the bill of the cap seems tight to me.",84509,4
84509,Will probably need some breaking in time.,84509,4
84509,The only thing I thought was funny and sad is it is made in China.,84509,4
84510,Hard time staying up,84510,4
84511,"I ordered one in navy and in black, both the same size.",84511,4
84511,Neither band fit the same way.,84511,4
84511,"The navy band was slightly larger than I expected, which worked out for when my belly got bigger.",84511,4
84511,"The black band fit much tighter, so I couldn't use it after a certain point when it got too tight.",84511,4
84511,"Despite that, it's a great buy to prolong wearing your normal pants while your belly is getting bigger!",84511,4
84512,"Because of these, I can still wear my regular jeans right now.",84512,4
84512,I am currently 5.5 months pregnant.,84512,4
84512,I would highly recommend these if you don't want to spend the money to buy maternity jeans.,84512,4
84512,I got the color black because it hides the zipper and buttons better.,84512,4
84512,"But through out the day, you will still notice your pants falling a little bit and have to readjust.",84512,4
84513,looks and functions elegant and high quality.,84513,4
84513,"only complaint is a bit too narrow for men's belt, lacking masculine.",84513,4
84514,"Really cute, bulges in back when tied but other than that I love it",84514,4
84515,This wallet insert is exactly what I was looking for!,84515,4
84515,I'd give it 5 Stars except it was relatively expensive.,84515,4
84515,I've purchased an identical item  before & it was less then $2.00.,84515,4
84516,"It's nice and warm, but the picture is not what you get.",84516,4
84516,The writing is more orange and the white is more gray.,84516,4
84517,This thing is warm and value for money.,84517,4
84517,The interior is very soft and cushiony.,84517,4
84517,That also helps to keep the wearer warm.,84517,4
84517,The colors are too good.,84517,4
84517,Have only worn it a couple of times so haven't washed yet so no comments on that.,84517,4
84517,The size was a bit small.,84517,4
84518,nice fabric; not full of lint,84518,4
84519,little more taupe and yellow than my son expected but the shirt is of good quality.,84519,4
84521,I used to get arm pain and numbness from many years of taking blood pressure manually.,84521,4
84521,After 2-3 days if wearing the bracelet I can say the pain and numbness has decreased about 80-90%,84521,4
84522,Bought these for my son and he loved them!,84522,4
84522,I would give them a 5 star if they were completely true to size.,84522,4
84522,They still worked out nicely tho.,84522,4
84523,The fabric on the dress was very beautiful however the dress was way too big and long for me as I am only 5'2 tall,84523,4
84524,Very pretty and flattering.,84524,4
84524,It was just too short for me.,84524,4
84524,"I'm 5'8"" and it was well above my ankles.",84524,4
84525,"I ordered an xs, I am 5'1 and 100lbs and it fits great.",84525,4
84525,Came with the belt.,84525,4
84525,Very cute and prefect length.,84525,4
84525,Only complaint is the top is very sheer and see-through.,84525,4
84527,It fit her great!!,84527,4
84527,We did have to add a tank because it was a little low cut.,84527,4
84527,Otherwise we are very pleased.,84527,4
84528,"Haven't used them too much yet as I'm still working on my costume, but they seem like they will work well.",84528,4
84528,"Seem well made, my only issue so far is that I wish they were all connected somehow as they kind of ride up one by one, though I also understand why they aren't, plus I can probably figure out a solution myself.",84528,4
84528,"Also, are they sold individually?",84528,4
84529,"Beautiful, expensive... does not have slots nor a pen holder...beautiful but no so useful.",84529,4
84530,Can't beat the price but I would definitely go 1 - 2 size higher.,84530,4
84531,This  is a super soft sweater with a great fit for my teen daughter.,84531,4
84531,She loves the pattern.,84531,4
84531,"The description did not list a size, so I had to guess the size by the measurements.",84531,4
84531,"She typically wears a ladies small, and this worked perfect.",84531,4
84532,took one size larger  just perfect.,84532,4
84532,only wish it had mr. power photo  on it  bt its great,84532,4
84533,"Made kind of boxy, but I get compliments when I wear it.",84533,4
84534,Short for a dress; great as a cover up,84534,4
84535,Gift for a teen and she loved it being a fan in all!,84535,4
84536,"Fits fine, but it's not black.",84536,4
84536,More of a dark grey.,84536,4
84537,The solid black color fabric is soft and cozy.,84537,4
84537,I think the black is a little sheer when you bed or around knees (curvy athletic build).,84537,4
84537,"I do not recommend wearing brightly colored underwear with these, but nude or black are fine.",84537,4
84538,"I love them I'm 5""3 there very long on me.",84538,4
84538,But other wise they r very comfy,84538,4
84540,they are cute but run small,84540,4
84541,Lack of insertable tab collars is a bit of a negative.,84541,4
84541,They are built into the shirt.,84541,4
84541,French cuffs are well sewn.,84541,4
84541,Cotton quality is fine with no burrs and thin as a tux shirt should be.,84541,4
84542,I bought these for my twin sons baby dedication at church.,84542,4
84542,"They are only 11 lbs, but the 3-6 month size was too small.",84542,4
84542,I managed to squeeze them into the outfits for service.,84542,4
84542,"Sadly, they will not be able to wear the outfits again.",84542,4
84542,So almost $50 for a one time wear.,84542,4
84542,"Aside from the size issue, the outfits are adorable.",84542,4
84542,I really enjoyed the fact that it was a one piece outfit and the tie clipped on and off.,84542,4
84542,I rated 4 stars due to the too small size.,84542,4
84543,I really like these yoga pants and own several pairs.,84543,4
84543,The color of this one is not what I would call Navy.,84543,4
84543,"The color is more of a dull and mutes than navy, more of a grey blue.",84543,4
84543,It's a great color too and I love these so kept them.,84543,4
84545,Very warm and comfortable.,84545,4
84545,"I am 5 foot 1 and they were long on me other than that great product

Update: still comfortable but after one wash the material looks snagged all over the place",84545,4
84546,I like this style of Jean for roominess although it is not Jean material I can no longer find them anywhere and it don't look like baggy jeans will return to mainstream ...,84546,4
84547,Is larger than I expected but looks really good anyhow.,84547,4
84547,The hood string disintegrated the first time I washed it but I still like the hoodie.,84547,4
84547,"I will try and find something to replace it will but until then, kinda dissapointed .",84547,4
84548,Beautiful colors and length is perfect.,84548,4
84548,A little low cut but it can be fixed.,84548,4
84549,People with larger legs won't be able to fit this as well.,84549,4
84549,"I'm 5'7"" and 130 lbs, and they're a little tight on my thighs, which are a little larger.",84549,4
84549,"They still fit, but they're just a little uncomfortable.",84549,4
84550,I order 2 size up and it is ok.,84550,4
84550,It arrived earlier that is a plus.,84550,4
84552,"Nice and  I love this plain white tops, but kinda small to him.",84552,4
84554,"Material is very thin, great for the summer.",84554,4
84555,I ordered a size up because of type of shirt and usually overseas runs small.,84555,4
84555,"If you're a medium, order a medium!",84555,4
84555,Cute sheer shirt though!,84555,4
84556,Ordered for Christmas wear.,84556,4
84556,Fit a bit more roomy than expected but pleased that it didn't run small.,84556,4
84556,Color holds well during washings.,84556,4
84556,Will order Allegra K wear again.,84556,4
84557,Shoes light up beautifully & my daughter loved them.,84557,4
84557,My only complain would be that the time frame you have to wait to receive the shoe is a little long,84557,4
84558,Fits and looks great will buy again,84558,4
84559,The hat is very large overall.,84559,4
84559,It needs some elastic around the edge of the hat.,84559,4
84559,Falls down over my eyes.,84559,4
84559,Some tissue paper like another user suggested does help,84559,4
84560,"Received the product on time, and it was packaged well.",84560,4
84560,The robe fit as expected.,84560,4
84560,"I bought a medium and at 68"" height it drapes about 10"" off of the floor.",84560,4
84560,I'm knocking off one start because the seam in the hood was done in a way that made it shed quite a bit.,84560,4
84560,"I simply washed it, ran a lighter over the seam a few times, and now it's good to go.",84560,4
84560,TL;DR: I'm happy with my purchase and feeling the comfort of the dark side ;),84560,4
84561,My only complaint is that there is a crease mark from it being folded.,84561,4
84562,This is a great idea to help your hat fit better.,84562,4
84562,How ever i think this could have been a little more dense.,84562,4
84562,I had to pile up 3 pieces over the top of one another to get it thick enough to make a difference.,84562,4
84562,I bought a high quality cowboy hat and wanted something made especially for hats instead of using the regular foam rubber weather stripping in the past.,84562,4
84562,"My head is like in-between sizes so if i buy a hat to small it gives me a head ache, and the next size up is a tad to loose.",84562,4
84562,"How ever this did work stacking 3 pieces, and this is a large roll so you'll have plenty for many hats to come.",84562,4
84563,It was cute and fit just right.,84563,4
84563,I was looking for something that goes well under jackets and this worked.,84563,4
84563,It's also not too long.,84563,4
84564,I bought these for my grandson who loves to play outside in any weather.,84564,4
84564,They fit well and are easy for him to get on and off.,84564,4
84565,I feel so adorable in this.,84565,4
84567,"Shirt is made from an okay material, it is very loose and perfect to wear with a cardigan.",84567,4
84568,The under slip fit well.,84568,4
84568,The dress itself was a bit big.,84568,4
84568,I ended up taking it in a little.,84568,4
84568,This was also a lot longer than pictured so I cut some off too.,84568,4
84568,"The lace was about 6"" longer than the slip.",84568,4
84568,With the modifications it fit really well and I got several compliments on it.,84568,4
84568,The color was just as pictured.,84568,4
84568,I paired it with lace up riding boots and cream colored sweater to wear to a rustic country wedding.,84568,4
84570,I do like it but I wish it wasn't almost 40 dollars.,84570,4
84570,"Its very light, it works, it just feels like it could be 10 dollars less.",84570,4
84571,Reviews said this ran small so I got an extra large.,84571,4
84571,"I'm 5'2"", 135 and size C chest and it fits just right.",84571,4
84571,I would've gone bigger in retrospect Bc that's how I like my workout tank tops.,84571,4
84571,"Lots of compliments, high fives and laughs!",84571,4
84572,"Bought for my father who wears L/XL, this hat adjusts on the sides which makes it versatile.",84572,4
84572,He had to let the straps out to the end.,84572,4
84572,The hat fits fine on his head when his hair is cut low.,84572,4
84572,"He did say that if he didn't get a haircut, it might sit too high on his head though.",84572,4
84575,"perfect length & color but the waist is very small, it was suppose to be large and I only wear medium but it was very small",84575,4
84576,I had such bad hip pain with this pregnancy and this product definitely helped my pain from the constant up and down from my desk.,84576,4
84576,My only complaint is that I wish I would have ordered a size bigger - it does run a little small.,84576,4
84576,"I could still use it, but it would have been better to have the extra support.",84576,4
84577,"Fit is a little large, but this hat is light and keeps the sun off your head and neck.",84577,4
84578,This product fit my 9 yr old perfectly.,84578,4
84578,It's lightweight material and she says its super comfy.,84578,4
84578,The little belt in the front makes it stylish.,84578,4
84578,My only complaint is the buttons aren't tightly sewn on so I will have to redo them.,84578,4
84578,I'm hoping the rest of the threads don't rip.,84578,4
84578,"I do feel the price is a little high for the material being so thin; however, if it holds up, I will buy more from the company.",84578,4
84579,Really good material the bow is to cheap,84579,4
84580,"A small pease of the glass get broke., i don't know if it has any kind of guarantee.",84580,4
84581,Darker in color than the picture!,84581,4
84581,I'm 5'3 141lbs and I got a XL and I normally wear a medium in clothes.,84581,4
84581,The quality is great!,84581,4
84583,"Nice fit, comfortable though the silicone pad doesn't exactly sit on my scar unless I pull the c-panty down a bit.",84583,4
84583,I'm 5ft and at end of day the c-panty rolled at top like pantyhose do...such is life for the petite!,84583,4
84583,That said it was nice to be able to wear underwear that didn't hurt when touching the scar.,84583,4
84584,"Its little small, but overall liked it",84584,4
84586,Came on time but a little large it's ok,84586,4
84587,Little snug but i knew i was on the fence for it fitting.,84587,4
84587,For some reason i thought it had the bra part built in so thats why i bought it.,84587,4
84588,"I bought these necklaces mostly as oil diffusers, so I wasn't concerned about what was inside, but as another reviewer noted 'it is an ugly clump of stuff inside' or something similar.",84588,4
84588,"What is in there, even though it does glow nicely when charged, is a really ugly clump of stuff.",84588,4
84588,They could of at least glumped it in there neatly.,84588,4
84588,"A pretty piece of felt makes it look nicer, and the design on the lid is very pretty.",84588,4
84588,I will buy more of them.,84588,4
84589,This is an attractive bracelet and very comfortable to wear.,84589,4
84590,Nice dress - my daughter loves it.,84590,4
84590,I like that the vendor requested my daughters measurements so that we would be sure it fit.,84590,4
84590,I purchased another dress elsewhere and the dress did not fit - returns to China are extremely costly.,84590,4
84590,I am glad this vendor was proactive so we could avoid any problems regarding fit.,84590,4
84592,The quality is okay for the price...you get what you pay for.,84592,4
84592,The only drawback is the sizing.,84592,4
84592,I bought a size XL.,84592,4
84592,"I am normally a size small to medium in US size tops...but this felt like an extra small to me, not a small or medium.",84592,4
84592,I am going to give the top to my teenage cousin....the top is just too small for me.,84592,4
84593,-1 star because they're kinda expensive.,84593,4
84594,I recently bought these pj's for our daughter and she loves them!,84594,4
84594,They're cozy and the right weight - not too hot.,84594,4
84594,"I probably could've gotten a size smaller, since they're supposed to be tight fitting, but they're not baggy and should last a good while since she has room to grow.",84594,4
84595,Like them but the quality is a bit weak,84595,4
84596,"Beautiful hat, arrived packed securely in a box, just tried it on my six year old today and it is too small but we will return and request the larger size because the hat is quality craftsmanship",84596,4
84597,Its a pretty dress.,84597,4
84597,I bougth size S but its too big for me.,84597,4
84597,So I fix and its beautifull.,84597,4
84597,My waigth is 100 lbs and 1.54 cms tall.,84597,4
84598,"I'm 5'5 ,140 lbs, and wear 36c.",84598,4
84598,The suit is small in the cup area.,84598,4
84599,very happy with this product,84599,4
84600,This is a loose fitting dress but be sure to order your true size - do not order up.,84600,4
84600,The fabric feels inexpensive but the overall look is lovely.,84600,4
84600,Needs a good pressing or steaming out of the package.,84600,4
84600,A good purchase for the money.,84600,4
84601,I bought these gloves for my husband and they were small for his hands.,84601,4
84602,"Smaller than expected but still fit, and is a nice shirt.",84602,4
84603,"I really like this, works great for me as it is so lightweight.",84603,4
84603,"I do want to note though, that the straps are about half the width of the straps shown in the picture.",84603,4
84604,I do love this!,84604,4
84604,It fits pretty  true to size.,84604,4
84604,"I have a smaller overall frame, but a bit of a belly so I ordered 1 size up.",84604,4
84604,That was enough to hide my midsection.,84604,4
84604,Wear this all the time!,84604,4
84605,"It's very nice product,I like it so much,but it's way too big for me,I have very small arms.so I returned it.",84605,4
84606,My daughter liked these - first part of a Halloween outfit and she continues to wear to school.,84606,4
84607,"I really like the bracelet; however, the link holding the clasp keeps coming apart, so I have to put it back together.",84607,4
84607,"Other than that, it is great!",84607,4
84608,I love this bandana bib but it's a bit pricey for one bib.,84608,4
84608,Also the bib is smaller than expected.,84608,4
84609,really good material but unfortunately I went by the reviews comments about the size so I ordered a bigger size :( SURPRISE is big on me.,84609,4
84609,For me this is Fit as expected item,84609,4
84610,Absolutely love this dress!,84610,4
84610,The colors are my favorite!,84610,4
84610,"But Before you buy check to make sure the size it right, it does run a little small and I had to get a size bigger than what I normally wear!",84610,4
84611,"Purchased the black one to wear to a wedding under a dressy jacket, looks elegant.",84611,4
84611,Beautiful fabric with slight sheen and comfortable stretch.,84611,4
84611,Followed reviews advising to size up.,84611,4
84611,The XXL worked for size 14; armholes are a bit tight but can be altered.,84611,4
84612,It was way to small but loved the dress.,84612,4
84612,I did get a refund on it thou.,84612,4
84614,The pattern on the skirt I received is different from what's pictured but I'm not complaining as I am pleased with the color and design.,84614,4
84614,It's a little shorter than I had expected and it has its limitations with how much shorter or longer you want it.,84614,4
84614,It also restricts your stride a bit so no running if you're late catching a train.,84614,4
84614,It came with instructions attached on how to fix the uneven hem or when one side peeks out the bottom.,84614,4
84614,"The stitching is a bit rough for the cost, making me question how well it will fare with its first wash, but overall I am pleased with this purchase.",84614,4
84615,This blouse is just what I was expecting it to be.,84615,4
84615,"The quality is good, for the price.",84615,4
84615,"The style can be worn as a modern blouse or the retro styling can be emphasized, depending on what you pair it with.",84615,4
84615,"It's soft enough to be comfortable underneath a sweater or jacket, sheer enough that you could wear a cami underneath, though personally I don't think it's required.",84615,4
84615,Depends on your level of modesty.,84615,4
84615,The bow is pretty and not of overwhelming size.,84615,4
84615,"Tucked into a pencil or A-line skirt, this is perfect for my taste.",84615,4
84615,"I'm 5'7"", 34D, 120-130lbs, and a small fits me well, not at all snugly.",84615,4
84616,A little snug & thin material but I love the style!,84616,4
84617,It is nice sweatshirt but it is not an XL....disappointed.,84617,4
84618,its warm and durable.,84618,4
84618,I love that I can pop it in the washer anytime and not worry about it falling to pieces.,84618,4
84618,I did buy extra large so I can wear bulky underneath so I can't be sure about the sizing.,84618,4
84618,The size I chose was perfect.,84618,4
84619,Fit well and stuck great!,84619,4
84620,Would have liked the New York Yankee logo on the hat.,84620,4
84620,Like the fact that Mickey's name was printed as well as his signature as we are giving it to our 6 year old grandson as he will be able to read the printed name.,84620,4
84621,A little snug for xl but good for the price,84621,4
84622,Could do without the lace across the back though.,84622,4
84623,Based on other reviews I ordered 2 sizes up (x-large) as I normally wear medium,84623,4
84624,Good sturdy product except that the strap that goes around the head isn't the one shown in the picture.,84624,4
84624,It's just a single strap that goes around your head.,84624,4
84624,Which makes it slide around when you have it on,84624,4
84625,"I suggest you get one size up , I purchased a size 36 B and my breast kinda pop but its not to the point that its uncomfortable.",84625,4
84625,"Its very amazing, it gives me that extra lift that other push up bras you buy from the dollar/Walmart store don't give you.",84625,4
84625,It also makes your breast look hella big.,84625,4
84625,This is my honest opinion about this item..,84625,4
84625,I cannot wait to wait to wear this bra with my dress for my birthday,84625,4
84627,It looks much better on than in the packaging.,84627,4
84627,I gave it four stars because in the picture it looks more dainty than it actually is.,84627,4
84629,Very tight but does glow.,84629,4
84629,Will need to leave it out in the sun for a long period of time to help with the glow effect.,84629,4
84630,These are amazing but my only issue is the inner pouch doesnt always fit right.,84630,4
84631,Great fit and comfortable keeps the boys looking awesome!,84631,4
84632,I ordered 2 separate swim trunks for my husband this summer.,84632,4
84632,"They both happened to be from this same brand, but they are WORLDS different.",84632,4
84632,The others came first and I was totally freaking out.,84632,4
84632,"But these fit just right, while the others look like ""shrunken hammer pants in shorts form"" where the bottom hem is skin tight to the point of being uncomfortable.",84632,4
84632,"Now, I ordered 1-2 sizes up due to reviews of the product for both.",84632,4
84632,I don't know if the other is just cut differently or if I just have that bad of luck?,84632,4
84632,But I would say this one is much better than the green striped with the same pattern.,84632,4
84632,It makes me nervous that two essentially identical swim trunks could be so different.,84632,4
84632,"Make sure, if you order that you have a back-up plan in case you need to return.",84632,4
84633,Couldn't breath when I tightened it.,84633,4
84633,So I think thats good lol.,84633,4
84633,Just needed to be loosened up.,84633,4
84633,I am 5'3 137 fatty lbs.,84633,4
84635,"It holds a lot, but when I first opened my package the zipper was busted.",84635,4
84635,How do you send a broken product to a buyer?,84635,4
84636,"He didn't think they would fit but upon trying them on, found they fit fine.",84636,4
84636,Says they are comfortable.,84636,4
84637,"present for a friend, colors looked a bit different when it got here but they loved it so i guess its fine",84637,4
84638,I gifted this to a friend who is as crazy about skulls as I am and she loves it.,84638,4
84638,"It loses a star b/c of the side zippers, which make it difficult to get into and out of the purse.",84638,4
84639,It arrived earlier than expected which to me is a plus.,84639,4
84639,It fit's well and I love the material.,84639,4
84639,Can I buy it again?,84639,4
84639,"yes, in a different color.",84639,4
84639,Very comfy for me.,84639,4
84640,"They feel great, but not having a fly is an annoyance",84640,4
84641,I did not receive this in exchange for my un biased review.,84641,4
84641,A little smaller and stiffer than I expected but that means I probably should have ordered a larger size.,84641,4
84641,That said I really like em and they make my butt look great.,84641,4
84642,Shirt is adorable but not a fan of the pants.,84642,4
84642,I put the shirt with just black leggings and it's super cute.,84642,4
84644,"This product did exactly what I needed it to do, but shame it didn't come with replacement pins, the one that is came with is flimsy and seemed like it was going to break.",84644,4
84644,But this product saved me money in the long run and I totally recommend it for those that don't want to spend extra money to adjust your jewelry.,84644,4
84645,"It was nice and had potential, but to go out in public in a swimsuit I need it to be perfect.",84645,4
84645,"I returned it, though it might work beautifully on a different body shape.",84645,4
84646,"I work as a part time server and this apron fits all my needs for my checkbooks, wine key, and pens.",84646,4
84646,Helps keeps things organized.,84646,4
84646,If it gets dirty flip it around as the same pockets are on the other side too.,84646,4
84647,I like it but it is itchy.,84647,4
84647,Hopefully that will not be the case after I wear it in.,84647,4
84649,The material for the leggings is thick and wonderful!,84649,4
84649,It's stretchy and tight in all the right places and actually seems to slim me down a bit!,84649,4
84649,The only draw back  is the waist line being a little strong and it can be tight if you don't try to stretch it before wearing it.,84649,4
84650,Thinner than I thought but works well,84650,4
84651,"I am 5' 11"" and 165-170 lbs and I got the large and it fits perfectly.",84651,4
84651,I think the other reviews are right that the sizes run a tad bit small.,84651,4
84651,The colors are also a lot darker than the picture on amazon.,84651,4
84651,But overall I really like the shirt.,84651,4
84652,"The quality is very nice, the color true to the picture.",84652,4
84652,"However, it is very narrow thru the shoulders on me and absolutely tight all thru the arms.",84652,4
84652,This would appear to be more of a juniors size than a misses.,84652,4
84652,I have requested a return.,84652,4
84653,"Excellent  am 5'2"" and weigh about 103 so they were a drop baggy but I am very pleased with them",84653,4
84654,Be careful with sizing!,84654,4
84654,"I ordered size 9 (expecting 39 European), but received size 40.",84654,4
84654,"But I guess they run somewhat small, because my usual size is 8 (38 EU) and these sleepers didn't fall off my feet.",84654,4
84654,"The slippers are cute, bright colors, and very well made in Austria.",84654,4
84654,Soles are firm and durable enough to wear outside.,84654,4
84654,Slippers are wide enough in case if you have wide feet.,84654,4
84654,I have high arches and they provide good arch support.,84654,4
84654,"You will have to wear them with socks though, because the insole is made of a cold material, not boiled wool.",84654,4
84654,I currently own another model of Giesswein slippers and those are made from boiled wool inside and out.,84654,4
84654,"That's why I didn't exchange, but returned these slippers - not only because of the wrong size, but also because they are not warm enough for me even with socks.",84654,4
84656,I like it very much however I think the size I choose is for a man,84656,4
84657,Bought in Dec. as gift for my child.,84657,4
84657,I have had to sew the upper shoulder seams as well as a hole that appeared in the hood and shoulder-not on the seams.,84657,4
84657,"The zipper also started pulling away from the stitching on both sides, my child wears this probably way more than it was 'made' for.",84657,4
84657,"Read the care instructions or it might get ruined, we have not had that type of problem yet.",84657,4
84657,"I bought it big on purpose, seems to be true to size.",84657,4
84657,"Fabric is nice, lets hope it holds together for Halloween!",84657,4
84658,Not as nice quality as I hoped but it will work for my event.,84658,4
84659,Simple and easy to put on.,84659,4
84659,"Inexpensive enough I don't worry about losing them, but I haven't lost them yet.",84659,4
84660,"Great style and feel, but material a little thin, mainly because I got it in white.",84660,4
84660,Just have ti be careful what I wear underneath!,84660,4
84661,Great long down coat.,84661,4
84661,"Red color is darker red than pictured, not a bright Christmas red I wanted.",84661,4
84662,Very happy with this top.,84662,4
84662,Great length for leggings and I'm 5'4.,84662,4
84662,Arms could be a little longer  Find I am pushing them up anyway.,84662,4
84662,Neck line comes up pretty high.,84662,4
84663,"Little small but I have large breasts but it holds them in tight
I love it looks more expensive and is very sexy",84663,4
84664,"Its Comfy, It is bigger, I ordered up because its said to run small.",84664,4
84664,Was very wrinkled when I got it...but over all I like it.,84664,4
84664,"its awesome, the necklace makes it all worth it.",84664,4
84665,Ordered for my soon to be grand baby.,84665,4
84665,Looks large for its size but will fit eventually.,84665,4
84665,I mainly ordered this for the adorable modern tipee design on the pants!,84665,4
84666,I got them to give as gifts.,84666,4
84667,i just got it so i don't know exactly how it feels after wearing it all day.,84667,4
84667,It got here way earlier than expected.,84667,4
84667,I was told it was going to get here feb. 29th.,84667,4
84667,So over a month early.,84667,4
84667,"Like other comments had said it is an elastic sort of feel, and not an actual shirt.",84667,4
84667,"Since i got the striped one, you can kind of see the stripes under neath the head.",84667,4
84668,"I love this hat, but wish the front brim were a tad bigger.",84668,4
84668,"Other than that, it's perfect.",84668,4
84669,Seems a little cheap made but very sexy.,84669,4
84669,Be careful unzipping it!,84669,4
84669,The side zips are real and almost took my skin off lol It is only worn by me for a few hours at a time so I give it 4 stars even with the cheap make because it does hold up for what I use it for.,84669,4
84670,I was a little skeptical because others that I had purchased (not from this seller) were very cheap.,84670,4
84670,They look sturdy and I get compliments on them every time I wear them.,84670,4
84670,"One down is that sometimes they fall from the top, a bit to top heavy but I can deal with that.",84670,4
84670,Very Happy with them.,84670,4
84671,I'm US size 8 and order medium which was perfect!,84671,4
84671,I'm 5'5 and 148 lbs.,84671,4
84671,it was delivered within 2 days #prime and good quality!,84671,4
84671,But I needed a nice satin inner under business suits.,84671,4
84671,Top has two side slits(funny) so I plan to tuck-in all the time...,84671,4
84671,I'll order other colors too!,84671,4
84672,My daughter loved this and wore it most days throughout the winter.,84672,4
84673,"I really loved this dress, it fit a bit weird, but would buy again",84673,4
84674,"For the price, this swimsuit is okay, they are selling same swimsuit on venus for a little over 40.00 bucks.",84674,4
84674,It's just missing the padding for bust area.,84674,4
84674,Like someone suggested can wear a bandu or triangle bikini top under it,84674,4
84676,Love the look but I feel the mother of pearl part around lettering should be more prevalent.,84676,4
84676,The lettering style is really nice.,84676,4
84676,Little pricing but they seem to be running the same prices no matter where you get them.,84676,4
84676,Hopefully they go on sale or you receive coupons at times.,84676,4
84677,I had a problem with the product and the seller was excellent in replacing the flip flops.,84677,4
84678,I bought it for my daughter's to wear as jr bridesmaid in my vow renewal ceremony!,84678,4
84678,I gave it 4 stars because it does run large.,84678,4
84678,I have to get alterations done other than that love it!,84678,4
84679,It was a bit smaller than I expected.,84679,4
84680,Great socks well made and fit great.,84680,4
84681,Nice size and good workmanship.,84681,4
84682,I want to give 3.5 stars.,84682,4
84682,My foot is a size 10 and these do have a tendency to slide off of my foot.,84682,4
84682,I wonder if buying the smaller sized ones would be better.,84682,4
84682,"I like them, in that they TRULY are NO SHOW socks.",84682,4
84682,"Without your shoes on, they look like little ballerina slippers, but they work great when they stay on your foot.",84682,4
84682,"It is annoying to be walking around, and feel that one of them has come off.",84682,4
84682,"So, I have had them for a while, and will continue to wear them, but feel like if your foot is on the border of the smaller and larger sizes, get the SMALLER sized ones!",84682,4
84683,Like it enough to keep it.,84683,4
84685,The round ball backs are very hard to install.,84685,4
84686,"that said, good product, fit alright.",84686,4
84686,Mainly got it for lols though,84686,4
84687,Chest portion is too shallow.,84687,4
84687,I am a 36 B/C and have to show serious cleavage or wear a Cami underneath.,84687,4
84687,Fabric not super substantial but very cute and soft.,84687,4
84687,Love it with a statement necklace.,84687,4
84688,These ears are fluffy and cute but let me tell you guys.,84688,4
84688,They are bright orange.,84688,4
84688,These come with a head band you slide through the ears if you kno your hair can't hold them up so that's nice.,84688,4
84689,Does have a weird gas like smell.,84689,4
84689,Had to wash 3 times and let it air dry outside before I was comfortable wearing it but for the price it's excellent!,84689,4
84690,I would have given these glasses a five had it not been that the temples are unusually short.,84690,4
84690,The curves for the hinges start long before they have approached their resting part at the ear.,84690,4
84690,"Yes, I have a normally proportioned face 
Other than that, they are perfect that I might decide to gift them to someone that's much younger and with smaller head proportion.",84690,4
84691,I don't like things high on my short neck but I got this anyway!,84691,4
84691,It is very nice but not my favorite because of the high neck but that is my fault!,84691,4
84692,I did not receive the matching wallet and called.,84692,4
84692,I got an unhelpful answer.,84692,4
84692,I love the purse though.,84692,4
84693,"I ordered an XL for length, but it was more for width than length.",84693,4
84693,Either way I loveeee it.,84693,4
84694,The only thing I don't like is it is much heaver than I expect.,84694,4
84694,May be a case made with aluminum is more light and suitable for lady.,84694,4
84696,The skirt definitely is a see through material type but for the price it's not bad.,84696,4
84696,"Good for summer when there's trips to the pool, beach or just longing around.",84696,4
84696,4 stars just because of the material.,84696,4
84698,After taking my daughters measurements we decided to order 1 size larger and I'm glad we did because it's fits nicely.,84698,4
84699,"Very pretty but I ordered the wrong size, however
they fit my granddaughter.",84699,4
84699,She was delighted with them!,84699,4
84699,I need to order a bigger set for me,84699,4
84700,"Good quality, but run a bit large",84700,4
84701,Really like the shirt however it is a little big.,84701,4
84702,Not leather inside but it's well made,84702,4
84703,"Delicate and nicely made, but it's rigid, and I was expecting a flexible clip.",84703,4
84703,"It works fine, though, and I use it a lot as I lose weight and am too cheap to buy new clothes every ten pounds!.",84703,4
84704,Great costume for the price.,84704,4
84704,Planning on wearing it to Emerald City Comic con this year.,84704,4
84704,I went with a custom size and it fits wonderfully,84704,4
84705,look nice for cake decoration,84705,4
84706,"great blouse, but too big... according to reviews i should have purchased a larger size, but i did and it was WAY too big.",84706,4
84707,Dress fit perfectly just didn't care for the front bust part,84707,4
84708,"I honestly loved this product and want another one, but I did order a size smaller based on a recommendation, and should have stuck with the belly bandit official size guide.",84708,4
84708,"With it being too small, it hurt more than alleviate pain and support my tummy.",84708,4
84708,It was uncomfortable to sit in because the size was wrong.,84708,4
84708,"Overall though, the quality is great, and i loved that the top or bottom could be tighter or looser depending on your needs.",84708,4
84708,"I will be buying one again, but in the correct size.",84708,4
84709,"Maybe a little on the small side, but I've always had a hard time getting hats large enough.",84709,4
84709,I wear an XL motorcycle helmet but the XLin this hat is slightly tight.,84709,4
84709,"Nice build quality, didn't shrink in the wash.",84709,4
84710,Good quality and nice options on length of chain.,84710,4
84710,The size is not overwhelming.,84710,4
84711,Nice quality but too small,84711,4
84713,Color was a little different than I expected but it fit good and is very comfortable.,84713,4
84714,"For the price, I didn't have high expectations, but they were just what I was looking for as a gift for a friend, and when I got them I was pleasantly surprised.",84714,4
84714,"They look like they will hold up decently, but I could see the stud bending easily if not cared for.",84714,4
84714,"They are just subtle enough, about a quarter inch diameter.",84714,4
84714,"The recipient loved them, and they can probably even be worn to work because they aren't gaudy.",84714,4
84714,I would buy this type again for other people without hesitation.,84714,4
84715,Have two other colors!,84715,4
84715,Probably will get more in future different colors.,84715,4
84716,Was a bit  bigger in the shoulders but its a lovely dress..,84716,4
84717,"Just as described, but lacks lining.",84717,4
84717,I wore this the day of Halloween to match my sons mickey costume and the hard tule was super itchy.,84717,4
84718,Nice and comfortable for little one,84718,4
84719,I love it the cuality is very good the only thing the it's to long,84719,4
84720,"The fit was what I thought- since one size fits all, I didn't have too big expectations.",84720,4
84720,"The legs are a little long on me, and the leggings are a little loose, but not bad.",84720,4
84720,"I'm a size 6-8P, in case that helps.",84720,4
84721,I think these glasses are great.,84721,4
84722,Perfect match the description,84722,4
84723,"quality could be a little better, but for the price you can't complain.",84723,4
84724,Original delivery was a belt that did not work for me.,84724,4
84724,"I gave a 1-star review, and a Customer Rep called me to advise that I had received an older model of the belt, and offered to send a replacement.",84724,4
84724,The NEW design works great; the reason why I didn't give a 5-star rating is that the buckle rides a little too high off the pants (it's a little thicker than normal buckles).,84724,4
84724,"However, it looks great and the customer service was superb.",84724,4
84724,"I'm going to wear it a while before determining whether or not to raise the rating to 5-stars, but I've got to give it to them:  Marino provides great customer service.",84724,4
84724,I am willing to purchase from them again.,84724,4
84725,I put one of these in my travel black purse and it's a little cramped in one section.,84725,4
84725,so the outer pockets are a little hard to use for me.,84725,4
84725,however the middle inserts are great.,84725,4
84725,"I works ok for me with this purse, I think it would work better in a purse that is a little bigger than mine.",84725,4
84725,Will try the other one in a larger purse.,84725,4
84726,"I have already reviewed the Binmer (TM) Swimwear (L, D) and found the suit too small and tight.",84726,4
84726,"However, I liked the style of the suit and how it fits- snug to the body with its elastic stretch, and the string keeps the suit from coming off during swimming or any athletics.",84726,4
84726,It appears perfect for a short-waisted body type.,84726,4
84726,It gives adequate support to the male groin area.,84726,4
84726,The price was also a drawing factor.,84726,4
84726,And it looks good on me (so my wife tells me).,84726,4
84726,"Because of these facts I bought the A suit in XL, and recently again purchased the D suit in XL.",84726,4
84726,I have no major negatives.,84726,4
84726,I would recommend the suit to anyone--just be careful about the size selection.,84726,4
84727,It's cute on but not for a long body.,84727,4
84727,I'm 5'3 and 36 c. A med fit me well.,84727,4
84727,The straps at the shoulder are just sexy enough.,84727,4
84728,"A bit thin, but an OK set of PJ's for the summer.",84728,4
84729,I liked this but it was way bigger than I thought!,84729,4
84729,It only fit for about 2 days.,84729,4
84729,"I do however, feel like it worked.",84729,4
84729,"It also helped me feel less like a bowl of jello, so I was active far sooner than I would have been without it.",84729,4
84730,Great shoes and I love the design.,84730,4
84730,I would definitely purchase other ones just 1/2 a size smaller.,84730,4
84731,This product surprised me.,84731,4
84731,"It's true they are still fairly visible in your ears, but compared to an actual piece of jewelry, they are very subtle.",84731,4
84731,I bought these for a business trip and they worked fine with the combination of me keeping my hair down to still hide the retainers.,84731,4
84731,"I also have kept them in for about a week by now, including 3 high-intensity workouts, showering, and sleeping, and they've been very secure in my ears.",84731,4
84731,"I was happy to receive 7 pcs (not sure if that was intentional) because I have exactly 6 piercings, so I was glad to have a spare in case I lost parts, so overall I am happy with this purchase.",84731,4
84731,"The only real downside is that they are fairly long, which makes them still noticeable in your ears (especially for me, they were more noticeable in my industrial holes than in my conch holes due to the angling).",84731,4
84731,"As another reviewer wrote, they are noticeable because they're a more white-clear than a perfect clear.",84731,4
84731,But for the price and how secure they are in your ears - and the fact that any retainers will still take up space and be somewhat visible - I'd say it's still a good product.,84731,4
84733,Beautiful piece of jewelry and very well made.,84733,4
84733,Would have given it 5 stars except the ball on the back of the post is super tiny.,84733,4
84733,If you are older than 2 you may help screwing the post into the ball.,84733,4
84733,Also depending upon the thickness of your cartilage may not be for you.,84733,4
84733,I am using this in the mid to upper part of my ear and barely fits.,84733,4
84735,Good lightweight boots for kids.,84735,4
84735,"The bottom part is a soft rubber, so kids may be able to damage them if very rough.",84735,4
84735,Easy to put on and no complaints about cold feet.,84735,4
84736,I wear an 8-10 and I'm 5'5 36c-d.,84736,4
84736,I ordered an xl.,84736,4
84736,Only issue is that the straps are the kind that hook on in the front and back.,84736,4
84736,They do come off easily but I'm going to squeeze the clasp tighter or maybe see them to be permanent.,84736,4
84738,I would recommend ordering a size or two larger than what you usually wear.,84738,4
84738,Fabric is very think and you can see through it.,84738,4
84738,Nice for the summer.,84738,4
84739,The dress was beautiful but unfortunately it was too big for my daughter and there were no smaller sizes available.,84739,4
84739,"We didn't have enough time to get it altered, plus with the beading I figured alterations would have been a little pricey.",84739,4
84739,We ended up returning the dress and buying one with a corset back.,84739,4
84739,This really was a beautiful color and dress though.,84739,4
84740,"I don't know if I had choose the right size, I suppose to get a size M not S and now it not fitting me at all.",84740,4
84740,There is any ways to exchange it with a medium size?,84740,4
84741,The material is nice and the dress fits as expected,84741,4
84742,"Love these, and so does everyone else.",84742,4
84742,A real attention grabber.,84742,4
84742,I don't like to walk with them on because you can't see great out of them.,84742,4
84742,I usually wear them on my head until I get to where I'm going and then drop them down over my eyes.,84742,4
84742,Also if the show is really visually special then I usually leave them up on my head.,84742,4
84742,"The three settings are cool, I switch it up a lot depending on what's happening in the music at the time.",84742,4
84742,"The controller could be a little more robust, it's kinda warping I think just under the stress from the battery springs, but for the cost I wasn't expecting a rock solid product anyway.",84742,4
84742,I've used them at a handful of shows and festivals now and they're still working fine.,84742,4
84742,I needed to glue the EL wire back on near the arm because it dislodged from flexing as you open and close the arms.,84742,4
84743,These perfect length workout tights are made to flatter the bodies curves and prevent muffin top.,84743,4
84743,"Its super comfortable rib fabric will get you hooked and spoiled, which it's good since you can mix and match with any piece in your wardrobe and keep wearing it all day long.",84743,4
84743,Its wicking-free management and odor shield feature will keep you fresh and dry for any plans on your busy agenda!,84743,4

84827,Great set of scrubs.,84827,4
84827,I get a lot of complements when I wear them.,84827,4
84827,It would be a lot more helpful if one was able to purchase as a set.,84827,4
84827,It's problematic trying to find matching pants to go with the top.,84827,4

84833,I am very pleased with this clutch.,84833,4
84833,It is roomy and seems to be decent quality.,84833,4
84834,"Love the color, but the fabric of this dress was entirely different than the fabric of the same dress and same seller in a different color.",84834,4
84834,This one was a little more stiff but has loosened up since I've washed it a few times.,84834,4
84835,Bought this for the Mrs. She loves them and said they were very cushiony.,84835,4

84837,it was blue - sent back.,84837,4
84840,"Very pretty, and it does the job but it's too pricey",84840,4
84841,They arrived extremely fast which was amazing !,84841,4
84841,I was soo happy to receive them since I'm a batman fan .,84841,4
84841,They did stretch my piercing just a tad bit but it was perfect because they keep wanting to close up anyways .,84841,4
84841,I would definitely buy these again they really do glow as promised the only thing I didn't like about them was that the backs are a little long and they did make my ears a little sore but the reason behind that is the bar on these are a little thicker then the average stud earring I'm used to wearing !,84841,4
84841,But I do love these & trust me youu won't be disappointed if youu decide to order these are a must for every batman fan who doesn't want real tapers  !,84841,4
84842,I was going to return it but then I received it in the mail today and its so pretty!,84842,4
84842,The only downfall is it doesn't come with a chain.,84842,4
84842,It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be as well.. anyways I love it and won't be returning it.,84842,4
84845,way longer than the description says,84845,4

84848,The bottoms are nice the tops not sure how they will last.,84848,4
84848,Think we re gonna stick with Carters.,84848,4
84849,These are decent shorts for lounging around or exercising in.,84849,4
84849,My only gripe is that the waist band is rather loose and I absolutely must tie the drawstring if I expect the shorts to stay on.,84849,4
84850,Nice workmanship and size.,84850,4
84851,"Fits a little snug, but it is well made.",84851,4
84853,Bottoms really strange even for high waisted.,84853,4
84853,Print fabric not great quality and stretches out white.,84853,4
84854,"The deep V of the dress was a bit inappropriate on me, but a couple tiny stitches solved that problem.",84854,4
84854,I love the colors and the material is so comfortable.,84854,4
84855,"The bust is always the hardest for me to fit properly-
No fault of yours, I love the material and color-
The price was almost perfect!",84855,4
84856,This shirt is as appears.,84856,4
84856,It does fit small so make sure to order larger than anticipated.,84856,4
84857,"I bought this bikini (medium)for myself but it didn't fit too well because the top wasn't big enough (my bra size is 32D) usually I wear size small, I'm 5 6 however I did give it to my cousin who is an extra small and wears 32A bra (5 10 tall)and it looked great on her, the top was a tiny bit loose size small would've worked.",84857,4

84860,"I'm 5'5"", 129lbs, 34dd.",84860,4
84860,"The bottoms fit perfect, but I like the more cheeky type of bikini bottoms.",84860,4
84860,"If you like full coverage, these aren't for you.",84860,4
84860,"The top covers my boobs perfect, but it does slide so I wore them with pasties to avoid any nudity.",84860,4
84860,"This bikini is beautiful, but it isn't a bikini to swim, and do activities in.",84860,4
84860,It's more of a bikini to just look pretty in and not do much other than stand and walk around.,84860,4
84860,"The top has adjustable ties on the top around the neck, and on the back.",84860,4
84860,"The cups do not move, they stay in place.",84860,4
84860,The bottom has a string which you can make it tighter if needed.,84860,4
84860,Both pieces have a thin white fabric which helps from seeing any of the private areas.,84860,4
84860,"I wore this bikini for about 4 hours, and washed it in delicate, and hung to dry, and it still looks like new.",84860,4
84861,"I think this dress is great, especially for the price.",84861,4
84861,Unlike others I don't think it runs small.,84861,4
84861,"I am 4'11"" and 130lb, which makes me short and pudgy.",84861,4
84861,My short and pudgy stature makes dress buying tough.,84861,4
84861,I decided to go with a small and it fits me well.,84861,4
84861,"The dress is flowy on me, not too tight and the length hits at my feet, so I wore a wedge sandal.",84861,4
84861,The only problem I had as far as fit goes is the straps.,84861,4
84861,"The straps continuously fell off of my shoulders, so it would have been nice if I could tighten them some more.",84861,4
84861,The thing is the dress cost around $15 with shipping so I am pleased with the purchase overall and I would recommend this dress.,84861,4
84862,Very light and good for everyday and travel .,84862,4
84862,I like it .quality very good,84862,4
84863,"I ordered an XL when I normally order a medium, and they fit me fine, so definitely plan ahead on this one.",84863,4
84863,"They won't last forever, but they are comfy, and will last long enough to justify the cost.",84863,4
84864,I loved the price!,84864,4
84864,I got a size medium and I wear about a size 5 or 6 in stores The bra is small I am small chested and the way it's sits is a tad awkward but I still like it the underwear fits good and the stockings fit me my thighs are on the thicker size  but they are one size however I could imagine they could not fit all.,84864,4
84864,Over talk though for the price I am not disappointed it will be fun to wear for my boyfriend,84864,4
84865,"Although I have NOT put any in my mouth yet, I'm already in love.",84865,4
84865,I received 6 sparkly tongue rings.,84865,4
84865,"One clear, black, blue, purple, & 2 different shades of pink.",84865,4
84865,"Considering I live in Washington state and the package comes from florida, I got it like a week early!",84865,4
84865,"It was packaged carefully and labeled as ""first class mailing"".",84865,4
84865,Definitely coming back in the future.,84865,4
84866,Pretty and looks expensive.,84866,4
84866,The only con is that you have to be careful not to break it because the band is only held together with rubbery string.,84866,4
84867,I wore these rings after my set didn't fit anymore during my third trimester and postpartum.,84867,4
84868,My son is about 2 1/2 about 30 lbs and the bam bam fits perfectly.,84868,4
84868,It's made well enough with felt fabric and triangles felt secure.,84868,4

84871,Fits good not to baggy n not to tight.,84871,4
84871,Only negative is the picture could be clearer,84871,4
84872,I do like this shirt and received a compliment when I wore it.,84872,4
84872,"However, it runs a tad small and I'm certain it would never fit me again if I washed it in the washing machine and dried in the drier.",84872,4
84872,"I'm hoping handwashing will lessens shrinkage but since it's a bit small to begin with, not too optimistic it's going to fit after handwashing either.",84872,4
84872,(Purchased the same shirt in two different prints.),84872,4
84873,"Yes it is a small frame but as a girl, is not for the thin faced.",84873,4
84873,I would suggest these for men or young boys with thin faces.,84873,4
84874,"I love this necklace, the only thing is the chain, its kind of cheap and flimsy.",84874,4

84875,"Lightweight, but functional for a costume with my band.",84875,4
84876,"Nice feel, very lightweight and silky.",84876,4
84876,"I got a 3X based on the size chart, but it is long in the sleeve.",84876,4
84876,I just push them up.,84876,4
84877,They run big in my opinion so they filled up quickly with sand in the ocean.,84877,4
84878,This top is cute.,84878,4
84878,I did go a couple sizes up.,84878,4
84878,I normally wear a size Medium (36D) and I got an XL in this because I was worried about it being tight based off of the other reviews.,84878,4
84878,I could have gotten away with a Large.,84878,4
84878,So go up at least one size of your normal size.,84878,4
84878,I did not expect that.,84878,4
84878,It also washed well and still felt soft.,84878,4
84878,It was a good buy for the cost.,84878,4
84879,"I haven't worn it too much, but it's a little small and looks different from the picture",84879,4
84880,Fit somewhat tighter around the bottom horizontal stripes part and shorter than I expected.,84880,4
84881,"I liked it, fit well :)",84881,4
84882,Very cute and high quality.,84882,4
84883,"I'm 5 foot 7 inches and weigh 110 pounds, 32a bra size and long torso, (no treasure in my chest or junk in the trunk).",84883,4
84883,"Its super cute and makes my chest look ok but I wish there was more padding, but that is what I have been saying since puberty so, no biggie.",84883,4
84883,And for the price...get right outta town!,84883,4
84884,"Nice shoes, but too small",84884,4
84885,Not to long or tight.,84885,4
84886,"The dress is perfect the size is a true size,",84886,4
84887,cute but runs very small,84887,4
84888,"Good quality, old-style tweed vest.",84888,4
84888,Good with casual shirt & jeans.,84888,4
84889,The torso section was too long for me so i had to do adjustments to bring the waist up but otherwise from that the dress was ok.,84889,4
84889,I am kinda excited to see it after the alterations are completed.,84889,4
84891,"They are a great size but the first time I washed them, the MILK IT black circle part faded a lot so the top black part looks a year older than the bottoms.",84891,4
84892,The contrast on the etching is a little light for my tastes and seems different than the picture used here but it fits perfectly and meets my needs!,84892,4
84892,Fast shipping and a great price!,84892,4
84893,Looks just like the picture and fits really well.,84893,4
84895,"Zipper  can be tuff to close, but all backpacks are like that.",84895,4
84896,Looks cute but I think they should improve the quality of the elastic and the charms.,84896,4
84896,1 charm fell off when i recieve it.,84896,4
84896,"But no big deal tho , i just put it right back and tighthen it.",84896,4
84896,Will give it as party favor for my daughter tea party.,84896,4
84896,For the price it is a great buy,84896,4
84897,Comfortable but fit very snug.,84897,4
84897,I stretch them out after I wash them so they aren't so tight.,84897,4
84898,"Very nice Halloween costume, and received lots of compliments, the material is stretchy so I would think it can fit different sizes",84898,4
84899,"I am only 5' 3"" so they were a little long.",84899,4
84899,Very warm and oh so soft,84899,4
84900,Looks but are really thin.,84900,4
84900,Thinner than expected and really small.,84900,4
84900,They don't fit quite as I hoped but are still nice.,84900,4
84900,They would be perfect size for a  child.,84900,4
84901,"Once you get them on and feeling good, they are great..........but getting to that point is an effort.",84901,4
84901,Right now one foot is great and the other I am still struggling with.,84901,4
84901,I have hopes that this one will eventually succumb to my effrorts.,84901,4
84901,"When they work, they are terrific",84901,4
84902,Not as I expected...,84902,4
84904,"This wallet is great, I think my only issue is the coin purse having this partial separation?",84904,4
84904,"The cloth between the sides doesn't come down all the way so if you keep your coins organized for some reason, I don't recommend this wallet.",84904,4
84905,This top is a good length and it is nice enough to wear to work.,84905,4
84905,The fabric is a nice off white but it is a bit sheer so you would need to wear a cami or something under it.,84905,4
84905,It is a bit tight in the shoulder area as well,84905,4
84906,"I am 5'5, 150lbs and it is a little bit under my arms.",84906,4
84906,I am saving this for my honeymoon trip to Hawaii so it's perfect for the beach!,84906,4
84906,"Other than that, it's cute.",84906,4
84910,"Nice jacket, just way too small.",84910,4
84910,The size large we ordered arrived (eventually) but it is approximately a size 8.,84910,4
84911,This blue was darker than what I expected.,84911,4
84911,I thought it would be a navy blue but is more midnight blue.,84911,4
84912,Good quality really cute and comfortable but definitely order a size or two up especially if you have a long torso.,84912,4
84912,But other than that it's really cute.,84912,4
84912,Definitely ordering more from this seller!,84912,4
84912,I am going to have to return mine for a bigger size unfortunately but I really love it.,84912,4
84914,I purchased these to wear with a tunic.,84914,4
84914,"I'm 5'4 and 145 lbs and while they fit, they are a tad on the large size.",84914,4
84914,I'd rather that than too small though!,84914,4
84914,They definitely have extra length for taller ladies as well.,84914,4
84914,They are very comfortable but I noticed some pilling after  wearing them just once.,84914,4
84914,It's not super noticeable but a little aggravating that it happened so quickly.,84914,4
84915,Cute dress but a little short.,84915,4
84915,Comfortable to wear around the house but too short to wear outside but if you are young and on the small side it's a very cute dress.,84915,4
84916,I was pleasantly surprised at the apparent quality of this swim suit.,84916,4
84916,All the seams appear to be well sewn.,84916,4
84916,The fit is exactly what I expected after reading other reviews.,84916,4
84916,"It's slightly on the small side, but I expected it and planned ahead.",84916,4
84916,The bottoms have a little less coverage than I was hoping for.,84916,4
84916,I ordered the L. I usually wear a size 8 dress and a 34B.,84916,4
84916,The top fits just as I hoped and the elastic in the bra is comfortable.,84916,4
84916,There is room for someone with a bigger bust without making mine look empty.,84916,4
84916,It might be a stretch to say the L fits up to a size 10.,84916,4
84917,A little difficult when I get a wad of bills but otherwise very nice to use.,84917,4
84918,There are many things that I see when I look at this purse.,84918,4
84918,The outer shell feels like a nice leather (I couldn't find a material listing on the purse).,84918,4
84918,The inside is lined with a satin feeling flowered design material that really doesn't go with the southwestern outer shell.,84918,4
84918,The color that shows in the picture (which looks the same when I took a picture) is not true life the purse actually has a more greenish blue that is very pretty.,84918,4
84918,The outer side pockets and top clasp are magnetic closures.,84918,4
84918,The back zipper closure does hold a 9mm Ruger with no problems.,84918,4
84918,The inside has a center zippered pouch and side zippered pouch with good amount of room on each side of the center pouch.,84918,4
84918,The top zipper closure for the purse was a negative for me because it leaves either end open (I will provide a picture).,84918,4
84918,The purse itself feels heavier than what I'm use to but really isn't an issue as I wanted the purse because of the back zippered pocket.,84918,4
84918,Disclosure: I received this product at a discount for my honest review.,84918,4
84918,I am not affiliated with the seller or the company that made this product.,84918,4
84919,"I don't think I did my measurements correctly, so I had to have it altered.",84919,4
84919,"I definitely recommend the gown, just buy it a size bigger than you normally would because it costs more to have it let out rather than taken in.",84919,4
84919,Have a professional take your measurements if at all possible; save yourself some headache.,84919,4
84919,I added a blingy belt to give this beautiful gown some wow.,84919,4
84919,I didn't take it off all night and it fit like a glove!,84919,4
84919,I also had 2 layers of the tulle trimmed out.,84919,4
84919,I did not wear a mermaid skirt underneath because the dresses shape was perfect!,84919,4
84920,Arrived quick & is good quality.,84920,4
84920,Looks great on & my daughter loves it!,84920,4
84922,This is really a great wig for the money.,84922,4
84922,"I used it for a teen production, and it made it through 5 performances and is still in great shape.",84922,4
84924,Very pretty dress and fit well.,84924,4
84925,Not quite as full as pictured but color is beautiful and is very swishy,84925,4
84926,Really cute but order larger size,84926,4
84928,I need a M for me because the L is some big.,84928,4

Do not wash this tail with detergent!",84929,4
84929,"There is a washing label on the tail, but it's in Korean so I couldn't read it.",84929,4
84929,There are washing symbols but I can never remember what those mean.,84929,4
84929,I should have looked it up but I have 3 kids and was just rushing.,84929,4
84929,I assumed that since its swimsuit material I could wash it--it turned black!,84929,4
84929,And is now sticking together.,84929,4
84929,I uploaded a photo to show you.,84929,4
84929,I'm changing my review from 5 stars to 4 since the washing instructions were not clear and since its not washable.,84929,4
84929,"Original review:
 My 3 year old LOVES this!",84929,4
84929,I ordered two--one for her and one for her to share with her friends at the pool.,84929,4
84929,She put it on the moment I took it out of the bag and hasn't taken it off since.,84929,4
84929,She even slept in it!,84929,4
84929,"She's spent 24 hours talking about what mermaids do...""Mermaids eat dinner with napkins in their laps.",84929,4
84929,"Mermaids fall asleep with their heads on pillows.""",84929,4
84929,The bra has stayed on for the most part.,84929,4
84929,She did wake up crying for us in the middle of the night because one of the straps came off and she needed it back on.,84929,4
84929,"As for the size, it's a little bigger than I was expecting.",84929,4
84929,"She can grow into it, which I love.",84929,4
84929,"It's pretty long, so she steps on it.",84929,4
84929,But it's also loose enough so she can pull it up when walking up stairs or running.,84929,4
84929,"When I ordered it, I wasn't sure if it was closed at the bottom or open.",84929,4
84929,"It's open, so her feet can poke out while she walks.",84929,4
84929,I also think that's safer for swimming.,84929,4
84929,"The bow on the underwear part is not sewn in place, so the bow can be pulled out.",84929,4
84929,I took some photos so you can get a better idea of what I mean.,84929,4
84929,The stitching is nice and I expect this outfit to be fairly durable as a costume/pool play.,84929,4
84929,"The washing instructions are all in Chinese or another language, so I have no idea how to care for it.",84929,4
84929,That worries me because I don't want to ruin it in the laundry!,84929,4
84929,"All in all, my daughter is so happy with this outfit, so I love it.",84929,4
84931,GOOD MATERIAL-CHILD LOVED IT.,84931,4
84932,"Is well made, color as advertized.",84932,4
84932,The zipper pocket is a little small; the size of the pieces is such that a pocket large enough to accommodate a credit card or a drivers' license should be possible.,84932,4
84932,It does fit some bills or postage stamps...,84932,4
84933,Somewhat small but still love he shirt.,84933,4
84934,The size of the circle and chain are just right.,84934,4
84934,The letters are what I was looking for.,84934,4
84934,The service was on target.,84934,4
84934,"I would have preferred a mat
finish.",84934,4
84935,Couldn't ask for better quality for the price.,84935,4
84936,"For the price, it's good.",84936,4
84936,The shoulders run a bit narrow.,84936,4
84937,Very cool and stylish goggles.,84937,4
84937,Purchased as a part of my burning man wardrobe and they were very popular amongst my friends and random acquaintances.,84937,4
84937,Knocked off one star due to them being slightly uncomfortable due to a lack of padding around the frame as well as there being a sharp piece of plastic that I had to file off from their injection mold.,84937,4
84938,A bit too small.,84938,4
84938,"I wear a size 7 and these fit me like a 6.5, bought a 38 so I just had to guess.",84938,4
84938,I can still wear them though.,84938,4
84939,Peefect gift for my lady.,84939,4
84940,Awesome fit of the size and even better prices.,84940,4
84940,I pay half the price for a good bikini.,84940,4
84940,Although the material is not the normal swimsuit material.,84940,4
84940,"I think they use wetsuit, making it feel weird",84940,4
84941,"Ordered yesterday,  had one day shipping for a gold and white party, not bad....",84941,4
84941,"I was a little scared after reading other reviews from other sellers, but I like it.",84941,4
84941,I ordered two sizes up and happy I did.,84941,4
84941,"If you'reyou're a large you may want to order an extra, extra large.",84941,4
84941,Here is my first try on- will be taking to the cleaners to get pressed before the gold and white party.,84941,4
84941,Happy with the out come.,84941,4
84942,I normally wear a size 14 and I ordered a 2x.....it fit perfectly.,84942,4
84944,A little large but really pretty,84944,4
84945,"I like the dress ordered medium based on chart but was way small, not sure to try again with large or xl.",84945,4
84945,I'm short like 5' and usually wear a M in women.,84945,4
84946,"very comfortable, and serves it's purpose.",84946,4
84946,"The bra is supportive enough, but definitely not a push up.",84946,4
84946,"The snaps are plastic, and material is soft.",84946,4
84947,This necklace looks very pretty with denim and my sundresses.,84947,4
84947,I received compliments on it.,84947,4
84948,"I have a Samsung Droid Turbo 2, and this purse is capable of fitting it, but only barely and only at the right angle.",84948,4
84948,"In person, it's a very cute bag, but it is very very small.",84948,4
84948,"The top (the part that holds the purse closed) cannot stand up straight, and the magnets in the top are slightly off-center so it can't close correctly.",84948,4
84948,"The rope handle is slightly too thin for my tastes, but overall it's a cute bag and I knew what I was getting into when I bought it, so I will not leave a bad rating.",84948,4
84949,"I wear an 8 1/2 size shoe, and bought the XL because I don't like things tight around my ankles.",84949,4
84949,"They're just a little long, but once wet, that doesn't matter, but they are still a little tight around the ankle.",84949,4
84949,"However, I really like them.",84949,4
84949,Using them to do water aerobics and walking in the pool.,84949,4
84949,They give you a grip on the pool bottom without wearing a shoe.,84949,4
84949,"I lost my first pair, and have since re-ordered because I really like them.",84949,4
84949,"Would give them a 5, except for the tight ankle.",84949,4
84951,Really like bathing suite but it fits really small I ordered a 2x n wear a 36d abd it was tight,84951,4
84952,"This was a gift for my 17 year old daughter, She loved it, I love it.",84952,4
84952,"Only negative is that its a tad large without a hairband on it,  so it will slip off a little too easy if not paying attention.",84952,4
84952,But a quality product for the money.,84952,4
84952,Will be buying more for Christmas gifts.,84952,4
84954,"Love them, except they are not actually white.",84954,4
84954,More of a pinkish cream.,84954,4
84956,"The coat itself is very cute and fits, however, the arms seem to run a little long so we just had to cuff them.",84956,4
84956,Otherwise I would recommend this product!,84956,4
84957,Great hoodie but runs small.,84957,4
84958,Cute but the hearts move...,84958,4
84959,I really like the print of the swim suit but the bottoms were small.,84959,4
84960,nice but didn't like the way the top part fits.,84960,4
84961,I read the reviews and ordered one size up fit was perfect the material and texture are good for the price....however  pattern does vary from  picture posted.,84961,4
84962,I like it... not love... but like.,84962,4
84962,You won't regret it if you buy it,84962,4
84963,I like it but sleeve are large for me,84963,4
84964,kind of a tight fit getting it all in there but we did it and she loved.,84964,4
84965,Worked well as a cheap work shirt,84965,4
84966,"Nice bracelet,  I love the  charms and the pink is so feminine and adorable.",84966,4
84967,The glow is an after math to direct light.,84967,4
84968,"This is no fancy piece, it's a no frills, cheap watch with a nice look to it.",84968,4
84968,The watch itself is solid and doesn't look like it'll break easily.,84968,4
84968,It's quartz so it'll keep time fairly accurately.,84968,4
84968,"The low point is the strap, it's awful and will likely break within a few months of continuous use.",84968,4
84968,But it's a inexpensive (cheap even) watch that'll at least look interesting.,84968,4
84968,Lowest part is that shipping took a long time.,84968,4
84969,"The sleeves have zippers that I hate and the sleeves are a little too long so they're pretty inconvenient, but I just roll the sleeves up to solve both of those issues.",84969,4
84969,Pretty great sweatshirt otherwise.,84969,4
84971,Is a nice t shirt but a little bit bigger than I was expecting.,84971,4
84971,I found that all converse items are too big.,84971,4
84971,Anyway still being a cool t shirt.,84971,4
84972,The green is not the same as pictured but the fit is ah-mazing.,84972,4
84973,"I am 5'6, feel as if this dress could be a sinche longer in the middle",84973,4
84975,"Great tank, soft and stretchy.",84975,4
84975,the iron on is cheap and thick plastic.,84975,4
84975,I would love to buy this without the iron on!,84975,4
84976,order up 1 size.,84976,4
84976,very nice otherwise and I ended up buying a second one.,84976,4
84977,"I was leery ordering a Chinese made tank top because of the sizing,but I am glad I did.",84977,4
84977,This fits nice and loose and easy care and wear.,84977,4
84977,"In the pic it looks like a t-shirt-type material,but it is more blouse-like.",84977,4
84977,Still very light and comfy.,84977,4
84977,I plan on washing in cold water and hang dry as I do with most of my clothing.,84977,4
84977,"Shipping took a while,but was with in the time frame given when I ordered.",84977,4
84977,All in all the price was good and I will be able to wear with jeans or skirt for summer.,84977,4
84978,"Very soft and comfortable, a little large on my hands.",84978,4
84978,Unfortunately the yarn thread to secure the buttons broke within a week.,84978,4
84979,style is just as advertised and its a very nice style for such a low price,84979,4
84981,The charms are beautiful.,84981,4
84981,A little bugger than I expected.,84981,4
84982,I love this necklace and earring set.,84982,4
84982,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when I received it one of the earrings had come apart from the hook.,84982,4
84982,It was very easy to fix.,84982,4
84983,Nice prints and workmanship.,84983,4
84983,Only at Busy is too tight..  Good supplmore,84983,4
84984,Easy to put together and size.,84984,4
84984,"The edges were a little rough, but that seems to be fading with time.",84984,4
84985,They look and feel great!,84985,4
84985,"I would have given 5 stars, but the package they came with had shampoo I ordered in it that got all over the box!",84985,4
84987,smaller on the bust but a fabulous cheap find.,84987,4
84988,I didn't get a sunburn!,84988,4
84988,This was a great rashgaurd and easy to swim in.,84988,4
84988,"I ordered a large, but I usually wear a medium after reading other reviews",84988,4
84989,Little too curvy for me.,84989,4
84991,For this to be a synthetic product I like!,84991,4
84991,"I don't like the ""white plastic scalp"" but a little concealer fixed that.",84991,4
84992,The shirt shrank in the wash so it turned into more of a belly shirt and it attracts lint.,84992,4
84992,I love the design though and it shipped quickly.,84992,4
84993,GREAT PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICE,84993,4
84994,I love black and white and the style of a tunic.,84994,4
84994,This top has a beautiful design.,84994,4
84994,It's too small across the top for me.,84994,4
84994,I'm a 38DD (size 12/14) and the large top doesn't cut it for me .,84994,4
84994,The purpose of a tunic is to feel relaxed and comfy.,84994,4
84994,"Also, I prefer a cotton blend for the warmer weather but this is polyester.",84994,4
84995,I just wish I had bought red.,84995,4
84995,Perfect size for travel.,84995,4
84996,Just a little snug but still fits.,84996,4
84996,I like my jackets a little loose,84996,4
84997,"This Satchel is nice in size, not too small.",84997,4
84997,Great for everyday use.,84997,4
84998,Nice looking top but too small.,84998,4
84998,Should have ordered a size larger than normal.,84998,4
84999,Nice shirt for the money,84999,4
85000,I have a large bust which makes the dress a little shorter.,85000,4
85000,Going to jazz it up with some accessories for a formal.,85000,4
85001,"Great socks; however, I do like the thinner Incredisocks I purchased last time a bit better.",85001,4
85002,"Overall, the best bang for your buck if you're looking for BTTF2 ""future"" shoes.",85002,4
85002,I was a bit disappointed that the tongue isn't nearly as long or as big as it should be (it barely sticks out above the velcro strap that wraps around the shoe.,85002,4
85002,"Only other real ""complaint"" was that the shoe doesn't have the ""bumps"" on the side like in the movie (where you would expect the ""power laces"" to be housed underneath the material.",85002,4
85002,But the lights look and work great.,85002,4
85002,Everyone at all the Halloween parties I went to loved them!,85002,4
85002,":) And if you check on eBay, there's a guy in China who sells a decal kit to add the ""Nike MAG"" decals and swoosh to these, as well as a kit to add a light-up ""Nike"" logo to the velcro strap.",85002,4
85002,"Overall, I was quite happy with these (as I'm a HUGE BTTF fan.)",85002,4
85004,"Like it, cute looking",85004,4
85005,Wish it came in a lighter baby blue color.,85005,4
85006,"Great hat, but this is only for kids.",85006,4
85006,Decent quality for the price and its lot of fun to wear when we play Pokemon Go at the park.,85006,4
85006,He gets compliments from other kids.,85006,4
85007,"I bought this for my girlfriend, she enjoys the material.",85007,4
85007,Its very silky and does not add the sweaty feeling.,85007,4
85007,It looks great on her and does not leave her exposed (It suits the curvy).,85007,4
85008,It's a bit tight.,85008,4
85009,"The shirt is flattering, but the sleeves are so short that they sometimes flip up and don't hang right.",85009,4
85009,Not really a big deal.,85009,4
85010,"I like this, but it has some cons.",85010,4
85010,The ones I bought before were not V-neck.,85010,4
85010,The low cut takes some getting used to.,85010,4
85010,"I like the wide band, its more supportive than my other ones.",85010,4
85010,The shoulder straps are really comfy!,85010,4
85010,All tanks should have these!,85010,4
85011,"Newborn is a far stretch, I say more like 5 months and up",85011,4
85012,this is nice and a good unique set to add that finishing touch to that fun outfit.,85012,4
85012,The chain is sturdy which I like since I work with kids a lot.,85012,4
85013,It is ggod and lioks great for this price!,85013,4
85014,And the price is good also.,85014,4
85015,This was slightly smaller than expected.,85015,4
85015,"Also, the straps do not stay in place, which makes it a little uncomfortable.",85015,4
85015,It seems to be due to where the straps are attached in the back.,85015,4
85015,"Other than that, the snap for the front is easy to remove and reattach and it holds the nursing pads in place.",85015,4
85017,The chain was giving me problems but I love it so far :),85017,4
85018,"I'm happy with the bag, the price is right.",85018,4
85019,I got this set as a gift for a fellow HP lover!,85019,4
85019,She loved it but the time turner was quite a bit larger than I expected.,85019,4
85019,"From what I briefly saw of it, the set isn't the highest quality, but then again I did not pay the price for high quality so it's not a big surprise.",85019,4
85019,"Overall it's not a bad set, I just wish the time turner was smaller.",85019,4
85020,I didn't know what to do about sizing because of the comments.,85020,4
85020,I'm typically a size 4 and bought these in a 7.,85020,4
85020,They're still pretty snug but okay.,85020,4
85020,Decent quality for the price (and great colour) so I'm going to buy a different colour in a 9 and see how those are.,85020,4
85021,Runs small so oder bigger size.,85021,4
85022,Lovely colors and finish.,85022,4
85022,Just be warned they are a little small.,85022,4
85022,"Ordered the 1/2"" and they're more like 00g",85022,4
85023,A little tight in the legs but ok otherwise.,85023,4
85024,Bottoms were a little small.,85024,4
85025,Comfortable and easy to work in them.,85025,4
85026,Like them but I think they run a little small.,85026,4
85027,"Beautiful and fits great, but a week at the beach and swimmimg in a pool really dulled the color.",85027,4
85027,"Within a couple weeks, the green had faded to white.",85027,4
85027,"Other than color problems, it's beautiful and holding up well.",85027,4
85028,Comfortable and great deal for the price!,85028,4
85029,It is not as flattering as it could be because the legs are cut low.,85029,4
85029,However the neckline is very flattering!,85029,4
85030,The product was great.,85030,4
85030,shipping was actually pretty fast.,85030,4
85030,I have a small waist therefore I had to get the dress taken up in that area.,85030,4
85030,"I took pictures where I had the straps showing and some where it was not showing only because the strap looked a little ""cheap"".",85030,4
85030,I will definitely add a picture when I upload to my computer.,85030,4
85030,thanks for the great services.,85030,4
85031,I really like the bag.,85031,4
85031,My only concern is the size.,85031,4
85031,For me it is too large.,85031,4
85031,If I could have the same bag in a smaller size I would certainly reconsider making a purchase.,85031,4
85031,Also the photos on line with  the description created some confusion when choosing.,85031,4
85032,I purchased this robe twice in the blue and purple.,85032,4
85032,Each came from a different supplier.,85032,4
85032,The blue color is true to what is on the website.,85032,4
85032,The purple is more on the burgundy side.,85032,4
85032,I don't mind that for the price.,85032,4
85032,The robe is very comfortable.,85032,4
85032,"I have not washed it yet, but I would wash it in cold water and let it hang dry because of the material.",85032,4
85032,The robe looks heavier on the computer than it is.,85032,4
85032,It is a lightweight velour-type robe.,85032,4
85032,The prices were very good.,85032,4
85033,This is a little large on my 2 yr old daughter who usually wears 18mon clothes but it is really cute and she will be able to wear it for at least another 6 months.,85033,4
85033,I'll just roll up the sleeves for now.,85033,4
85034,"Super comfortable and cute, the only problem is that it does not close completely and I would have liked it to.",85034,4
85035,Fits a bit snug.,85035,4
85036,it goes with everything,85036,4
85037,Fits a bit small but I read reviews and ordered a size up.,85037,4
85038,Very cute bought several to give ad gifts.,85038,4
85038,Cheap way for a nice little gift.,85038,4
85039,"It looks and fits nice, but it's not for a tall girl.",85039,4
85039,"I'm 5'9"" and 200 lbs.",85039,4
85039,I got it two sizes up and it still seemed a little small.,85039,4
85039,"It's easy to put on, but after wearing it for a while, my boobs started falling out and it was very awkward (38DD).",85039,4
85039,It stopped a little past my belly button so it was way too short.,85039,4
85039,"I got a different one made for longer torsos, but if you're on the shorter side, this could really work for you.",85039,4
85040,Does help to organize.,85040,4
85040,I like the part mesh top to see what is in the bag,85040,4
85041,"I am 5,3 130 pounds.",85041,4
85041,The size is not by weight it's by height the taller u are the larger u need to get it.,85041,4
85041,I got medium it's a little hard to get on due to it only opening partly on the chest but it's super cute and comfy!,85041,4
85042,"TheThe dress is cute, but it's sized too small.",85042,4
85042,This is due to being Chinese.,85042,4
85042,I got a 4t & that's what my 4y old daughter wears.,85042,4
85042,The size is labeled as 10 (Chinese).,85042,4
85042,"1st of all, I had to shove my daughter's head thru to get it on, 2nd of all, it's short.",85042,4
85042,"I didn't order it with enough time for an exchange since today is her birthday, so I just had her wear leggings underneath.",85042,4
85042,"I have a 2yr old daughter that wears 2t,so she'll get it next & it'll probably fit perfectly.",85042,4
85042,"The length almost looks fine, but since the top layer is tulle, you can see thru, with the layer underneath being super short.",85042,4
85043,So far so good!!,85043,4
85043,I love this fitness tracker.,85043,4
85043,"My main workout is swimming laps everyday,1-2 hours.",85043,4
85043,It doesnt  count laps but atleast I get a semi acurate count on calories burned and sleep pattern.,85043,4
85043,It has not problem in the water.,85043,4
85043,I love that about this smart watch.,85043,4
85043,Also steps count is good.,85043,4
85043,"The reason 4 stars is the tiny booklet,  tiny letters and lousy instructions..Otherwise it would of been a 5 star...
7-17-16...*****UPDATE UPDATE**********
I JSUT SAW THIS WATCH FOR $15.95!!!",85043,4
85043,WHAT A RIP OFF AMAZON,85043,4
85044,It was to small and not long enough,85044,4
85045,"It's nice, fits a bit larger than expected.",85045,4
85046,These were great for our baby!,85046,4
85046,Awesome with his christening outfit!,85046,4
85047,It came a bit small than other Calvin Klein shirts with the same size that I bought before.,85047,4
85047,But it is not a problem of the store.,85047,4
85048,Nice belt love the design.,85048,4
85048,Just wish the notches were closer to the tip.,85048,4
85049,"Super cute dress,  but the small fit more like a medium, unfortunately.",85049,4
85049,Wish it came in XS!,85049,4
85050,Perfect for what I was needing.,85050,4
85050,I wanted a wristlet to keep cash and my debit card in.,85050,4
85050,Something I could just grab and not have to take my whole purse or large wallet into a store for a quick errand.,85050,4
85050,It's great for that.,85050,4
85050,My Samsung Note 5 won't come close to fitting.,85050,4
85050,I don't expect it to last year's but definitely feel I will get my money's worth out of it.,85050,4
85051,"Fit a lot smaller than expected, but still very cute!",85051,4
85052,It was a gift she seemed happy with it.,85052,4
85053,Cute and okay quality-way too big for our average size 4 month old.,85053,4
85053,Should fit her when she is maybe 12-18 months.,85053,4
85054,It is good product for the price.,85054,4
85054,It needs a few more 'bones' to make it tighter.,85054,4
85054,Overall exceeded my expectations for this price.,85054,4
85055,"Love the look, nice material, but I find it is hard to keep on with it's lovely ""flowing"" but open structure.",85055,4
85056,Somewhat small if you have wider hips and larger backside.,85056,4
85056,Color is bright and sparkle is plenty!,85056,4
85056,Just don't expect these leggings to stand alone as pants.,85056,4
85056,They could show skin or underwear when sitting down.,85056,4
85056,But they are honestly still comfortable under a skirt or dress or with a long tunic shirt on.,85056,4
85056,"The waist is not too tight, you can just tell they would look better on someone with a ""straighter"" figure than someone with a ""curvier"" one.",85056,4
85057,Heavy and pretty good quality for cost.,85057,4
85058,Look like designer glasses.,85058,4
85059,"Perfect fit, light weight perfect for the summer and can dress up as business casual.",85059,4
85060,Good and resistent materials.,85060,4
85061,This is a decent set of single flare tunnels.,85061,4
85061,They all came with o-rings but the rings ranged from 2g to 0g and even some 00g.,85061,4
85061,"But the tunnels are all 0g and fit well, they have a shorter flare that makes them very comforable to wear.",85061,4
85061,The finish is not perfect but three sets of tunnels for this price is a pretty good deal.,85061,4
85062,Material is much thinner than most sweatshirts.,85062,4
85062,Overall it is nice.,85062,4
85062,Does seem to run a little on the small side.,85062,4
85063,"Hat is great, except that the one I received says ""Make Donald Drumf Again"" and mis-spells his last name Drumpf.",85063,4
85064,Smaller than i imagine,85064,4
85065,This is a very pretty and comfortable top.,85065,4
85065,"The way it is sewn brings attention to my shoulders, which are already broad, so I don't like that very much.",85065,4
85065,It is a little more oriental looking on than I expected.,85065,4
85066,Ran a little small.,85066,4
85066,Gave it as a gift.,85066,4
85067,Just be careful when you wash - the material leaves a lot behind and creates lint build up.,85067,4
85068,"It is a small ring, but it's still cute in my nose.",85068,4
85070,Small at the top.,85070,4
85071,"I'm a Burlesquer and I bought these for a X-men show, they look great fit great!",85071,4
85071,Which for me is hard bc I have wider feet than most and pointed shoes tend to be very narrow.,85071,4
85071,no cushioning in them what so ever.,85071,4
85071,"But they look great on, fit great and aren't to slippery to dance in.",85071,4
85071,I love them but please be advised my feet were aching after 3 hours....,85071,4
85071,Pain is beauty though right!?,85071,4
85071,other than not having any cushioning there super well made and I was more than happy with them!,85071,4
85072,I like the quality of their product and they deliver so fast.,85072,4
85073,"Great material, quality construction and a fun purchase.",85073,4
85073,"The size is a little small, though.",85073,4
85073,"I've purchased similar items from other companies, these run small.",85073,4
85073,It could just be the inherent size differences due to construction and material used.,85073,4
85074,We purchased this for my daughter to wear for several events leading up to graduation.,85074,4
85074,It is a bit tricky to get wrinkles out of especially when it first arrives in packaging.,85074,4
85074,It is good quality for the price but certainly not the highest quality fabric.,85074,4
85074,It is definitely a good buy though as it does do the trick for banquets and such where it won't be worn more than a handful of times.,85074,4
85074,"She is just shy of 5'6"" and it was a nice, modest length landing just a the top of the knee so it fit in dress code for school events.",85074,4
85074,"Good, basic, banquet dress.",85074,4
85075,Nice quality ... As expected ...,85075,4
85075,Arrived  on time,85075,4
85076,"Got a medium because of my boobs, and was rather large, was able to sew it to fit however.",85076,4
85076,I am 5'3 110 lbs but DD boobs,85076,4
85078,I need to start wearing them again,85078,4
85079,I'd give this 5 stars if the lace wasn't a totally diff color than the rest of the dress... dress is great.,85079,4
85079,Perfect size and fit...,85079,4
85079,I'm 5.1 138 lbs with bust 36 and waist 32... size 8 fit great!,85079,4
85080,"After reading the previous reviews of it being smaller than expected, I ordered it two sizes up.",85080,4
85080,Because I like my yoga tanks loose.,85080,4
85080,It is a bit too loose and not nearly as long as it appears to be.,85080,4
85080,This shirt is just a regular tank not a tunic length.,85080,4
85080,"But for a cute tank top, I think it's wonderful!",85080,4
85081,Size chart on Amazon for these briefs is incorrect.,85081,4
85081,Medium is 32-34 on package and 36-38 on Amazon.,85081,4
85081,Briefs seem fine but time will tell.,85081,4
85082,Liked the shape and fit but it is super thin and see through.,85082,4
85083,I really love it...,85083,4
85083,I think I'll get in silver as well.,85083,4
85084,"The embossing on the front is a little light, but otherwise fine - spaces for ID, etc...and will protect your passport.",85084,4
85085,Very good fit and material.,85085,4
85085,Gets scratches on it fairly easily though.,85085,4
85085,Other than that love it!,85085,4
85086,"I like the shirt just wish it was a little longer,",85086,4
85088,Nice for the $.,85088,4
85090,"I got this in a 3x, it fits great, but as with most t-shirt prints they keep the ratio of the image the same for the smaller shirts as they do for the larger.",85090,4
85090,"Otherwise the shirt is awesome, and exactly as advertised.",85090,4
85090,I have a longer torso so the length was also perfect for me.,85090,4
85090,"I will note that the neck hole, as many other reviewers have stated is tight, so heads up on that too.",85090,4
85091,It's a pretty dress but the fabric that covers the breasts is very very see through!!!,85091,4
85092,I bought a large based on my measurements and had to burn a new hole at 37in because it was too long.,85092,4
85092,"It feels like a nice, quality belt and fits fine now that I have a new hole.",85092,4
85092,"Length from end to end: 46.6in
There are 5 holes an inch apart from 38.5in-42.5in
1.5in wide",85092,4
85093,"Excellent shoe, but we had to order a second pair within a few hours of my daughter wearing them as one led bulb or strand stopped working and then would light up different colors then the setting she was using, so far no issues with the second pair, she loves them, excellent fit, very well made except the one issue noted above.",85093,4
85095,Don't believe reviews that it fits small.,85095,4
85095,Fits just right to size,85095,4
85096,Love love love it.,85096,4
85096,My daughter looked so cute,85096,4
85097,I liked the hat a lot but it was too small for my large head/face.,85097,4
85098,The only down side is the purse is a little heavy.,85098,4
85100,"Size runs a little small, otherwise would give 5 stars.",85100,4
85101,"The item was too small, but I received a full refund.",85101,4
85101,"They were very cute, just needed a larger size",85101,4
85102,"Fits great , love the material, not sure about the white lace",85102,4
85103,"great suit, fit fine for water aerobics but faded fast in the chlorine.",85103,4
85103,Will try chlorine resistant for pool next time.,85103,4
85104,"The product was smaller than expected, but I had read a previous review stating this prior to my purchase, so it fits my daughter.",85104,4
85105,This bikini is so vibrant and looks exactly like the photo.,85105,4
85105,Pros: The bright colors.,85105,4
85105,The package came in a 2-day delivery with Amazon prime.,85105,4
85105,Cons: The bottoms run a bit big - I wish I would've sized down.,85105,4
85106,"I usually wear shoes size 44 and this socks was barely fit to my feet, it,s size 42 - 44 if anyone use bigger size then don,t buy from it, anyway the quality of it is good.",85106,4
85107,The reviews lamenting on the unexpectedly small size of the jacket were confusing and misleading.,85107,4
85107,"Hence, I ordered the medium (I usually wear a small 4-6) and it was far too large for my frame.",85107,4
85107,I am 5'8 145lbs.,85107,4
85107,I tried the jacket on with my thickest winter sweater and I still felt like I was swimming in it.,85107,4
85107,"That being said, the medium seemed an accurate 8-10 size.",85107,4
85108,"Overall I like the shirt, but there are a few problems.",85108,4
85108,"The alien in the picture looks like it's printed on, but it comes embroidered.",85108,4
85108,"It is not very well sewn on, and I had to cut off some of the excess material.",85108,4
85108,There were also loose strings everywhere I had to cut.,85108,4
85108,"I got the pink shirt, but the color doesn't look quite like the picture; it's more orange-pink.",85108,4
85108,"Still, it's a pretty cute shirt and I will be wearing it.",85108,4
85108,"I'm usually a small (5'2 and 120ish lbs), but I ordered a medium just in case, and it fits pretty well, so I'd recommend ordering a size above what you are.",85108,4
85108,(The pictures are taken after I cut off the extra material from the embroidering),85108,4
85109,"It's a cute cardigan type, but the pockets are a bit ""behind"" or in the back verses where they should be up front.",85109,4
85109,That's a bit strange.,85109,4
85110,Material light and cool.,85110,4
85111,a tad bit small butbi love it so,85111,4
85112,Pro: It's a beautiful dress.,85112,4
85112,Con: it was a little short.,85112,4
85113,I tried a medium.,85113,4
85113,The torso is very short and it did not fit.,85113,4
85114,I ordered up one size.,85114,4
85114,The top fits well and hides my mom flab.,85114,4
85114,The bottoms are small though.,85114,4
85114,Definitely don't cover everything.,85114,4
85115,Nice and long I'm 5/11 it reaches my ankles,85115,4
85116,Skull orange not red,85116,4
85117,But was somewhat small.,85117,4
85118,Based on previous reviews I ordered a size up and I am sure glad I did!,85118,4
85118,"The dress tends to run small but overall I like the fit of the dress, the length, and the price!",85118,4
85120,"The sleeves are very, very tight.",85120,4
85120,The body is very roomy and long.,85120,4
85120,I am 5'2'' and it comes down nearly to my knees.,85120,4
85120,"Also, the beige color has a distinct peachy/light orange tint.",85120,4
85120,NOT a neutral shade but a warm shade.,85120,4
85120,I bought this in three colors and only kept one.,85120,4
85121,"I already have this shirt, and this was no different.",85121,4
85121,"It is cut generously, although thin and lightweight, and did not shrink.",85121,4
85121,"Just what I was expecting...if you want something more form fitting you may want to go down a size, but this is cut to be rather slouchy.",85121,4
85122,Little tight but still love this,85122,4
85124,"It's nearly impossible to find 100% cotton sweatshirts these days, so I am very happy to have found this one.",85124,4
85124,"It does run small, however.",85124,4
85124,"I would recommend ordering one size up for ""fitted"" and two sizes up for ""loose.""",85124,4
85124,The quality seems pretty good and the color was the same as it looked in the picture.,85124,4
85125,"Awesome dress, fits perfect and super comfortable.",85125,4
85125,I'll be also buying the short sleeve version,85125,4
85126,I am a size medium and I ordered the xl.,85126,4
85126,"If your bigger than a medium, this will likely not fit you.",85126,4
85126,The product is the same has in the photo.,85126,4
85126,Red with a flower print.,85126,4
85126,The dress is sheer as expected and beautiful I think.,85126,4
85126,I ordered one the 6th of July and received my order on the 16th of July.,85126,4
85126,"Personal note, it is very flowy from behind and just looks super cool in the breeze, if your bohemian, like me, go for it honey you won't be disappointed.",85126,4
85127,I would have given it 5 stars but the latch seems a little flimsy  It hasn't broke yet but everytime I pull it tight I do it carefully,85127,4
85128,"Very Tight on me top not meant for chubby bodies , thus doesn't cover very much downstairs but can just add a petticoat for that or none at all not like it isn't meant to be enticing",85128,4
85129,Great yoga pants at a great price.,85129,4
85130,"Alright, I'm on the plus size here, so I knew this probably wasn't going to fit, but I gave it a shot anyway, it's a great price.",85130,4
85130,"I want to mention that I bought this for a music festival, not as a swimsuit.",85130,4
85130,"(It is see-through, I don't believe this will do good in water)
I received this pretty quickly to my surprise.",85130,4
85130,"The print is not centered, which wasn't a big concern for me.",85130,4
85130,"I'm 170lbs 36DDD 5,3' and this fit pretty good, it's not too tight, and doesn't show a lot, the front is a bit low as far as the cleavage goes.",85130,4
85130,"Like I said this isn't meant to be a bathing suit, so I wore a bra with it, which will show a lot if you move a lot.",85130,4
85130,So if you have a large chest you probably want to wear something underneath to avoid flashing someone.,85130,4
85130,"This material is very stretchy, and the print still shows fine
Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase, I would definitely buy different prints again!",85130,4
85131,"Love the fact they stay in place and I don't have to tug on them constantly, but they do make my ankles swell.",85131,4
85131,I'm short so they are more ankle length than Capri,85131,4
85132,They were not as pictured.,85132,4
85132,"The order says ""blue shoe"" but both pairs ordered were this green and blue shoe.",85132,4
85132,My fianc ordered the same pair from his Amazon account and we ended up with two pairs of these green ones.,85132,4
85132,They are handy though.,85132,4
85132,Easy to get on and off.,85132,4
85132,They stop my son from slipping and falling in the kitchen.,85132,4
85132,They seem pretty comfy for my 17 month old,85132,4
85133,i love this top!!,85133,4
85133,"it is very cute and comparable to brandy's
it is not as soft as i thought it would be though
but for the price, cant beat it",85133,4
85134,No it's cute will wear to their play,85134,4
85136,"Shirt is so soft, feels great.",85136,4
85136,"I usually like to go braless, but won't be able to in this shirt.",85136,4
85136,It's a bit revealing.,85136,4
85138,get a size up bc it looks weird too tight under ur butt,85138,4
85139,Fit well and are comfortable.,85139,4
85139,I have washed them several times already and they maintain their fit and color,85139,4
85141,this is a pretty dress sexy and nice for a small person  its cheap for a honest review,85141,4
85142,They do slide up the leg a little,85142,4
85143,"Great hat, just a little smaller than expected.",85143,4
85143,Only means I get to wear it not him!,85143,4
85144,It will be hard to layer with this jacket.,85144,4
85144,Should order a size up.,85144,4
85144,"Good for cool, early fall weather.",85144,4
85145,I like the shirt just that it is a little see through,85145,4
85146,I wish the other 3 side pockets had some type of closure so everything doesn't fall out.,85146,4
85146,Perfect size for nurses!,85146,4
85147,Deducted one star for lack of backs and being slightly heavy.,85147,4
85147,Otherwise packaged very well and in it's own pouch.,85147,4
85149,"Hat looks great, but you need to be careful traveling in transit because the brim can get misshapen easily.",85149,4
85150,"Cute, ended up returning due to the shape not looking good with my face shape but my friend loved them",85150,4
85152,They're a bit snug around my thigh and bottom area but the fabric is soft and there's a lot of bandwidth to move about freely!,85152,4
85153,Love this purse just wish it was bigger,85153,4
85156,This dress was absolutely beautiful on me!!,85156,4
85156,I felt so amazing!!,85156,4
85156,I normally wear a size 22/24 so.i went ahead and ordered the 4X.,85156,4
85156,"It was extremely tight in the chest on me, however, I have G cups, so I wasn't surprised by that.",85156,4
85156,"It was slightly uncomfortable, but not enough to deter me from wearing it for a night out.",85156,4
85156,"I'm 5'10"" and it fell below my knees.",85156,4
85157,Looks just like the photo!,85157,4
85157,I love the shape and feel.,85157,4
85157,Didn't smell funny or anything.,85157,4
85157,The only problem I had was that there was a small smudge on the moschino part of the case.,85157,4
85157,It was small enough to be disregarded but you can tell it's there if you're looking for it.,85157,4
85159,If you're tall this will not be good to wear as a dres.,85159,4
85159,"Thankfully I'm short so I pulled it off, couldn't bend over lol but looks exactly how it's pictured",85159,4
85160,I was extremely satisfied with the quality based on the price.,85160,4
85161,The color doesnt run when your arm gets sweaty.,85161,4
85162,Good value and quick delivery,85162,4
85163,I looked good in this.,85163,4
85163,Its polyesters not cotton,85163,4
85165,I ordered a medium and the top fits good but the hems ate really narrow.,85165,4
85165,Will have to open the sides for a more comfortable fit.,85165,4
85165,I must say the colours are more vibrant than the picture,85165,4
85166,"5'4/152lbs/34C, Very cute, can be dressed up or down, material is stretchy, but fits very well, belt is a little large, I don't really care for the button on the back but overall its great",85166,4
85168,"Fits my very skinny 9 yr old a bit loose, but should be ok for a regular built kid.",85168,4
85169,"I love this shirt- it's comfy but best of all, my husband said it looks really good on me and he hasn't said that about any of my clothes!",85169,4
85169,I take a medium in shirts and this fit perfect.,85169,4
85169,My stomach kind of shows (I don't really care) but with the right pants or sweater I think this will be so cute.,85169,4
85169,"I ordered the light blue one since I don't have anything in that color, so beautiful like a sky blue",85169,4
85171,great just wish there were more protective padding inside the case,85171,4
85172,This jacket is cute and comfy.,85172,4
85172,It is a little larger than I would have liked (I ordered a small and am 115lbs and 5'2).,85172,4
85172,I still like it a lot and might buy the green one next.,85172,4
85172,Though it did take 21 days to receive it from the shipping date (I decided it was worth the wait since I couldn't find any other jackets in these colors that are lightweight and have a belted/tied waist and pockets ).,85172,4
85172,It is the perfect weight for end-of-summer and beginning of Fall and I also like that the sleeves can be rolled up and held with the tab/button details.,85172,4
85172,"If you are willing to wait for it to ship, I'd absolutely recommend it!!",85172,4
85173,Although it's a little large I still like it.,85173,4
85173,Kids grow fast so it will eventually fit.,85173,4
85173,My son love it!,85173,4
85175,love to buy another one,85175,4
85176,Would have given this 5 stars if it was sized a little bigger.,85176,4
85176,Very lightweight and cool to wear.,85176,4
85176,Washes well and dries quickly.,85176,4
85177,"The pom fell off, but other than that it's perfect.",85177,4
85178,Fits my 8 month old granddaughter great.,85178,4
85179,Was just like the photo..love it,85179,4
85180,Not really ment for large bellied women.,85180,4
85181,"Hard to put on, but I still like it.",85181,4
85182,"A little bit bigger than expected, but overall it looked nice.",85182,4
85183,"The shirt fit well....a little loose, as expected when we ordered a size up from her normal size...but the shorts are TINY!",85183,4
85183,"They still fit, but it's VERY snug.",85183,4
85185,Very cute in the back but the front is lacking a bit.,85185,4
85185,I added a cinch in the center to give the front a bit more flair.,85185,4
85186,This suit runs a little large.,85186,4
85186,I'm sending it back but I have already ordered one size smaller.,85186,4
85186,It's a really pretty bathing suit.,85186,4
85187,Purchased for a cruise.,85187,4
85187,Love the color and fit.,85187,4
85187,I'm very tall and love the length.,85187,4
85188,I liked the top.,85188,4
85188,I'm just returning it for the next size up.,85188,4
85189,I am short so it was a li longer than pictures and a li loose.,85189,4
85189,But over all it was nice.,85189,4
85190,"Fit great, nice and stretchy.",85190,4
85191,"Kiddo loves it.....Might be a tid bit too small, but have a rather large 4 year old and bought the 6 so he could use a little longer fits perfectly now).",85191,4
85191,looks like it fits comfortably on him though and the dinosaur mania makes it his fav.,85191,4
85192,These were bought for a gift for my two cousin.,85192,4
85192,The pink one is adorable.,85192,4
85192,I am not sure I like the blue one especially since that has a shoulder strap and it is too long for a two year - I would rather have two of the ones that did not have shoulders straps.,85192,4
85192,I am sure she will like both.,85192,4
85192,I think both are good quality for kids play purses.,85192,4
85193,It fit good and was comfortable.,85193,4
85195,Good product and arrived earlier than expected!!,85195,4
85195,One ball was slightly cracked but still useable,85195,4
85196,Good product good price.,85196,4
85196,Its a bit saggy and can't tell the inside vs. Outside.,85196,4
85196,But still very comfy and looks good,85196,4
85197,This dress is beautiful and extremely vibrant.,85197,4
85197,The zipper is sturdy and fabric is very comfortable.,85197,4
85197,It was very long but I purchased it for a friend who is 9 months pregnant and the waistline hit perfectly above her belly.,85197,4
85197,I also tried it on to show the low cut of it but it is supportive enough you don't have to wear a bra.,85197,4
85197,The reason for 4 stars was because there are sections of the lace that do not lay flat and are spaced awkwardly.,85197,4
85198,Great Shoes they are very comfortable as well I personally modified them though the only down side to these shoes is that there not mad of the best material but steal I think for the money these shoes are worth it:);) take a look at how I modified them you can do that too if you have the material.,85198,4
85198,Overall great pear of shoes the only thing it's lacking is the quality:).,85198,4
85199,Really comfy and stretchy!,85199,4
85200,"Some of the sizes are too small to work with, and others are so big they look outrageous on my ears.",85200,4
85200,But there are plenty of sizes in the middle that look great and are easy to put on and take off.,85200,4
85200,"I have two piercings in each ear, so I can play around with size combinations, which is great.",85200,4
85200,The one thing I don't like is that some of the pieces would screw together if you mix them up.,85200,4
85200,"Like, if I have two earrings of the same diameter, and I switch the two backings, they won't screw on.",85200,4
85200,I have to match them correctly.,85200,4
85202,Don't expect tummy control with these shorts.,85202,4
85202,Great to cover up the upper legs.,85202,4
85204,First time I tried one of these belts.,85204,4
85204,"I like having more control over the slide adjustment than over holes, which can be a big jump in between.",85204,4
85204,"Seems to be of good quality, the price is fair.",85204,4
85204,"I am assuming the belt will last longer than belt with holes, but we will see.",85204,4
85204,Belt also came with what appears to be a key ring with a leather strap on it with a snap (Se pic).,85204,4
85204,"There does not seem to be anyway to attach it to the belt so I am assuming an extra ""gift"".",85204,4
85204,No mention made in the description or with the product when it came.,85204,4
85204,The box the belt came in is very extravagant.,85204,4
85204,"Perhaps some people like the quality of the packaging, but I would prefer less cost through less expensive packaging.",85204,4
85204,So far I like the belt a lot!!,85204,4
85204,After 7 months I find that the buckle falls off as the compression teeth which hold the leather in the buckle have lost their grip.,85204,4
85204,This occurs only when the tongue of the belt is taken out of the buckle.,85204,4
85204,"A person could cut the belt in order to relocate the gripping area, but this again would only work for a time.",85204,4
85204,I return again later even after the 7 months with praise for Marino.,85204,4
85204,"They have a Warranty which states that if you cut too much off of the belt and the fit can only be too tight, they will send you a new belt.",85204,4
85204,"I certainly like this Warranty as it has benefited me, but I am more concerned that the company remain in business for future purchases than file bankruptcy!",85204,4
85205,"I'm a curvy 5'2"" (110 lbs) and usually wear an XS in most things.",85205,4
85205,The fit on this was a bit awkward.,85205,4
85205,"The arms were too short, but the armholes themselves were larger than normal causing it to be a bit baggy in the bust area (despite me being a 32D) and overall was not as formfitting as pictured.",85205,4
85205,"That being said, the length of the torso was definitely shorter than expected, which worked well for me, but I could see being problematic for anyone who is not short-waisted.",85205,4
85205,"Also, as others have mentioned, you basically have to squeeze your whole body through the neck holeso good luck!",85205,4
85205,"Overall, still looked hot though!",85205,4
85206,I bought this outfit for the robe.,85206,4
85206,"I am 5'5"" and weigh 110 lbs and it fits but I could use another inch or two for it to tie properly.",85206,4
85206,Overall I like the item though.,85206,4
85206,The bra/panties are not my thing but look fine with no flaws.,85206,4
85207,Love this Flipeez hat!,85207,4
85207,It was just pretty big compared to the others I've purchased in the past but I'm ok with it.,85207,4
85208,"Very comfortable, they are a little bigger than expected but not a huge problem.",85208,4
85208,They set a good example and look amazing.,85208,4
85209,Arm holes are too small.,85209,4
85209,"However, it looked great for the beach wedding.",85209,4
85209,It's just hard to roll up your sleeves.,85209,4
85210,"This product overall is good, and comfortable, and perfect for people with small wrist",85210,4
85211,"I love the material, the design.",85211,4
85211,It was just a bit bigger on the sleeves than I wanted it to be.,85211,4
85211,Over all its a great quality shirt.,85211,4
85212,The skirt I got is super cute and I love to wear it.,85212,4
85212,"There are some loose threads and like others stated, one if my elastic straps was sewn backwards so there is a permanent twist in it.",85212,4
85212,I've been buying enough cheap clothes from China lately to just automatically assume something will be wrong and accept that however.,85212,4
85212,"The teal color is true to the picture and as with any Asian clothing, definitely order up in sizing.",85212,4
85212,"I'm 5'7"" and weigh 160, carrying most of that in my bottom and thighs.",85212,4
85212,I got an XL and it fits fine despite being pretty short.,85212,4
85214,"Overall I like it, but it is extremely small so know that going in.",85214,4
85214,Realistically you can only hold 6 cards and a folded up dollar bill.,85214,4
85214,Another small problem I had with mine was extra fabric in the inside off the center pocket of the wallet I had to remove.,85214,4
85215,"Nice fit, and not too bulky.",85215,4
85216,I ordered this for my daughter's birthday.,85216,4
85216,It was shipped quickly and she really likes it.,85216,4
85217,"VERY, VERY CUTE NECKLACE!",85217,4
85218,Apparently my arches are not symmetrical so I only wear one in my right shoe - but it solved my foot ache problem when I run.,85218,4
85219,"Good for what I bought it for, which is just to loosely go over a bandeau bra.",85219,4
85219,But it's a very thin material and the seams are sub par.,85219,4
85221,"Tankini too small for my liking, but seller is very kind refunded me",85221,4
85222,"it is like the picture, however the links need to be closed completely, i had to use some pliers on a link because the chain kept coming undone",85222,4
85223,So far I like this wallet.,85223,4
85223,"It takes a little getting used to and feels a little weird in my pocket initially, but that quickly became no issue.",85223,4
85223,I like the RFID protection and the plastic slide out to hold cash or coins or whatever will fit is a nice touch.,85223,4
85224,My 6 year old son loves this.,85224,4
85224,"The main ""saber"" retracts.",85224,4
85224,The sides are not retractable but this doesn't bother him.,85224,4
85224,I wish it had sound.,85224,4
85225,I'm so pleased both with the dress and the company that sold it.,85225,4
85225,"Less than 3 hours after I ordered the dress, an employee called for my measurements and agreed to have me email them.",85225,4
85225,"And in less than a week I received my dress and the bust, waist and hips fit sooooo perfectly!",85225,4
85225,"I'm really short, 4'11, and clothes are often way too big on me so I was really happy that this dress fit me so well.",85225,4
85225,The length of the dress is way too long but that was to be expected regardless of what dress I bought because I'm so short.,85225,4
85225,"Since I did send in my measurements for the length of my dress and they did not adhere to that, I could not give them 5 stars.",85225,4
85225,"However, I contacted them about this problem and they agreed to split the cost to get it hemmed by a local tailor.",85225,4
85225,The dress is a great mix of elegant and sexy.,85225,4
85225,"The material isn't perfect, especially at the edges of the neckline, but that's to be expected by a dress so cheap.",85225,4
85225,"Also, the dress has a bottom layer to it that's kind of thick and heavy; my prom is in June so I'm worried that I might get really sweaty because of how thick the fabric is.",85225,4
85225,"But overall, the product is worth its money!",85225,4
85227,well made and the finish is good quality.,85227,4
85227,"So far working well, now if they only could make a model that causes the waist to shrink!",85227,4
85228,Super cute outfit but the arms are crazy long and the legs a tad short.,85228,4
85230,"Cute, good fit but things coming from China can taka a LONG time!",85230,4
85231,"Fit as expected, but not much stretch to the fabric.",85231,4
85231,Overall nice fabric and better than I expected.,85231,4
85231,great shirt to dress up or down.,85231,4
85232,Really like that I am able to find two piece swim suits that don't make me feel like I'm showing too much skin.,85232,4
85232,"I got the 5X The top was too big for me, I'm an A-cup, and this came with a D-cup.",85232,4
85232,"It was also padded under wire, so it could not be easily adjusted.",85232,4
85232,That was the only part that I took a star off for.,85232,4
85232,"I understand that most things that fit my bottom do not fit my top, I just like it better when there's room to adjust.",85232,4
85232,"The size fit nicely, I like the pattern.",85232,4
85233,I really love the dress but the elastic waist is a little to snug.,85233,4
85233,I wish they sent instructions on how to create all the different types of styles,85233,4
85234,Size 33 waist should get large!,85234,4
85235,fast service nice  product.,85235,4
85236,"It's a beautiful bag, but much bigger than I expected.",85236,4
85236,I'm keeping it anyway.,85236,4
85236,It comes in handy when I have a LOT to carry.,85236,4
85236,"I walked up to my neighbor's house for a party the other day and even with everything else I had in my purse,(phone, wallet, glasses, umbrella, etc..), I was able to stuff six beer bottles in there and still had room for more stuff!",85236,4
85237,So far .... so good.,85237,4
85237,I don't lose my glasses because I keep them in the same place every night.,85237,4
85237,And I can see the holder with my glasses off.,85237,4
85237,The only thing I would change is to make holder a bit bigger to protect more of the top lens.,85237,4
85240,"Be prepared to not have your girls be secured in there, this is definitely not a suit I would go play in the pool with.",85240,4
85240,It is a little hard to get into and out of.,85240,4
85240,"My boyfriend loves when I wear it, so provacative.",85240,4
85241,Order your regular size,85241,4
85242,I was hoping this would be more suitable for the cooler months but it is very light weight.,85242,4
85242,Will layer it for wearing this fall & winter.,85242,4
85243,"Very nice material,  but way too  small",85243,4
85244,These toddler hats are Not true to size.,85244,4
85244,They were big on my three year old granddaughters.,85244,4
85244,It fits my grown Daugthers.,85244,4
85244,Maybe if you wash them in hot water they'll shrink to size but I didn't try.,85244,4
85244,They are cute tho.,85244,4
85244,I am keeping them because my grown Daugthers are wearing them.,85244,4
85244,What is also nice is that the hats are warm and are thick heavy yarn and nicely made,85244,4
85246,Fit good and its warm.,85246,4
85247,I liked the style and fits well,85247,4
85249,"A bit see-through, but still cool.",85249,4
85250,I am a fairly athletic guy.,85250,4
85250,"i run a lot so my glutes and quads are quite big, the fit is reasonable if you like the compression feel, which i do like.",85250,4
85250,"if not, then buy a size higher.",85250,4
85250,"i haven't had an issue as far as discoloration and losing the fitness of the boxers, overall they are just a good pair of boxers.",85250,4
85250,"btw, if your girl sees you with these shes gonna want to rip them off",85250,4
85251,This pair of shorts fits perfectly and they are very comfortable.,85251,4
85251,The denim is not bulky and stiff.,85251,4
85251,I only just received them but noticed there is a offensive odor to them right out of the package.,85251,4
85251,"I always wash clothing before wearing, so these just came out of the washing machine and they still have a noticeable odor.",85251,4
85251,They smell like Raid bug spray.,85251,4
85251,"I'm hoping this diminishes because I've already ordered two more pairs, but they are in the dryer and I can still smell them!",85251,4
85251,"I should note that I do have a very finicky nose and heightened sense of smell, but still, I think you'll notice it too.",85251,4
85251,I will try to post an update when my other shorts arrive.,85251,4
85252,Really nice and simple clutch.,85252,4
85252,It seems fragile so I'm really careful with it but it completes my outfit.,85252,4
85254,I ordered these pajamas for my 5 year old and the blue set with white polar bears for my 3 year old.,85254,4
85254,I love how soft the pants are and how warm they keep my kiddos.,85254,4
85254,"They run small though, particularly the shirts, so we won't get quite as much use out of them as I was hoping.",85254,4
85254,I ordered a 6 for my 5 yr old and it fits like a 5T.,85254,4
85254,Same for the 3T I ordered - fits like a 2T.,85254,4
85254,The pants are long enough to get lots of wear time but they'll grow out of the shirts pretty quickly.,85254,4
85255,I like the Hammered Distressed Belt tho I wish the buckle was a bit bigger.,85255,4
85256,"I am 5'9'', with 36D boobs.",85256,4
85256,Usually a medium fits good but it is a bit too short in the front.,85256,4
85256,"Back of shirt, covers about half my butt, which is preferred for some outfits.",85256,4
85257,Very good product am happy that I bought it.,85257,4
85258,My doctor recommended this shoe and I so far am thrilled.,85258,4
85258,Have not had a chance to wear them all day so not sure how my feet will feel at the end of the day.,85258,4
85259,Greats but a little large for me.,85259,4
85259,I'm 5'5  and 145lbs,85259,4
85261,I love the shirt but it does fit a little too big.,85261,4
85261,I usually wear an XL so that is what I ordered.,85261,4
85261,"Unfortunately, the sleeves are a little too long and bulky.",85261,4
85261,I'm hoping to exchange for a smaller size.,85261,4
85261,"Regardless, I LOVE the shirt and the sticker!",85261,4
85262,Cute purse for kids.smaller than expected but very pretty..,85262,4
85263,"I'm 5'7"", 150 lbs, curvy, 38DD, and the size I bought fit really nice.",85263,4
85264,Went by the manufacturer sizing and XL fit perfectly for waist 34.,85264,4
85264,"The only reason not to give the product 5 stars is that they are high-maintenance: don't put in the drier, wash by hand or delicate cycle... lots of trouble for taking care of underwear.",85264,4
85265,Not quite as big stones as I thought but still nice.,85265,4
85266,Great colours but none came with earring backs...,85266,4
85267,Super cute and I love the bottoms I got,85267,4
85268,"The color was exactly like the one in the picture, I love the fabric and all... just, the straps are very long so I had to get them tailored.",85268,4
85269,Really like the light weight fabric.,85269,4
85269,We'll see about the life expectancy.,85269,4
85269,Check back in 6 months.,85269,4
85270,Love the fit and the length,85270,4
85271,"I like this tunic, but keep in mind, it was made for someone on the slender side.",85271,4
85271,"It's a bit tight in the butt area, but it is still a very cute tunic.",85271,4
85272,This shirt is amazing.,85272,4
85272,I ordered a size M and I was afraid it would be too small as it is from China but it fits perfect.,85272,4
85272,I am 5'5'' tall and M size covers my belly button completely so it's perfect.,85272,4
85272,Fits great and isn't too short.,85272,4
85272,The material is great too.,85272,4
85272,"It isn't cotton but it isn't completely ""fake"" either- to me it's a great material for a shirt.",85272,4
85272,"I feel like this shirt isn't only for cosplaying to be used as a costume, I think it's a pretty good shirt to wear in every day life, I know I will!",85272,4
85272,All in all I am very satisfied with my order.,85272,4
85272,The shirt is kind of expensive but it is worth $25.,85272,4
85272,"The shipping was also fast, it took less than a week.",85272,4
85273,Sent to my daughter as a gift.,85273,4
85273,The glow isn't as bright as some and only charges well in full sunlight but the design makes up for it.,85273,4
85274,Only complaint is that the button holes are a bit small.,85274,4
85274,It takes some effort to get buttoned.,85274,4
85275,"They are cute and they did come with a protective bag to cover them, but I would have liked the frames to be a little thicker.",85275,4
85276,I got a lot of compliments when I wore this skirt .,85276,4
85276,I think it looks cute higher up on the waist so that's how I wore it.,85276,4
85276,It fits nice and tight the way a leather skirt should.,85276,4
85276,The only problem I ran into it that the front of the skirt would rise up at the slit,85276,4
85277,Looks good and fits good i would definatly recommend it,85277,4
85278,Needs to be ironed.,85278,4
85279,"Beautiful, high quality dress.",85279,4
85279,Size ran very big- had to use many safety pins.,85279,4
85279,"However, the smell from it was awful.",85279,4
85279,I didn't have time to get it dry cleaned before our vacation and was forced to coat the entire thing in Lysol.,85279,4
85281,I love these but would like for the material too not be so attracted to fuzzies and fur magnets.,85281,4
85281,The waist was a bit loose/baggy but not too bad that it was noticeable.,85281,4
85283,This wallet will fit a couple of credit cards and some bills in the middle pocket.,85283,4
85283,There are 2 pockets on each side for a total of 4 side pockets and one in the middle.,85283,4
85283,Perfect for a night out when you don't want to carry too many things.,85283,4
85283,"This definitely was not designed for every day use, unless you are a real minimalist.",85283,4
85283,"Mine came with a lighter brown color, much lighter than what shown on website.",85283,4
85284,"This shirt does run small, but I've recently lost some weight so I was looking for a shirt that was a little more form fitting.",85284,4
85284,"I'm 5 ft 6, 150 lbs and I got a size large.",85284,4
85284,"I have had two babies, and so this is a little snug around my midsection just because I have excess skin there, but otherwise I like the fit.",85284,4
85284,I think it's super cute!,85284,4
85284,"There were some places where a string was poking out, but I cut them off.",85284,4
85284,I hope it doesn't cause something to unravel!,85284,4
85285,Looks great perfect fit,85285,4
85286,"These are a beautiful sandals, just a little tight in the front and loose in the upper side, I am wearing them at home to brake them in and hopping to wear them out pretty soon.",85286,4
85288,"These were just a tad small, but other then that they are great!",85288,4
85289,Shirts fits me okay.,85289,4
85289,I'm usually a medium.,85289,4
85289,It looks adorable in person.,85289,4
85289,Just a little bit thinner then I expected.,85289,4
85290,my girlfriend loved it,85290,4
85291,This too was perfect.,85291,4
85291,It looks just like the picture & fits great!,85291,4
85292,Very nice gift for someone,85292,4
85293,I ordered a medium but usually wears small probably should have gotten a small.,85293,4
85293,Best part it is has pockets!,85293,4
85294,"This is a beautiful shirt for summer, great quality and has lace on the back that adds style to the shirt.",85294,4
85294,"It is not see through at all and the armholes don't show my bra or anything, so there is no need to wear anything under it.",85294,4
85294,"It does run large, usually I wear a large or extra large but I ordered this in a medium and it fits perfect.",85294,4
85294,Which is great because I think any bigger and it would look huge on me.,85294,4
85294,It also comes with a sash that you can tie around your waist to make a tighter fit if you like.,85294,4
85294,This is a great option to have different looks with this shirt.,85294,4
85294,"*****I have been ordering from this company for a long time and one thing I have learned is that if you follow the measurements under the product description and order according to that, you will have a great fit.",85294,4
85295,"Great quality,  however it's awkward to get on my daughters foot cause she has fat feet and her heel will not go to bottom of the shoe.",85295,4
85295,Hoping she will eventually be able to fit them properly,85295,4
85296,"bought a size 18 month for my 12 month old, he is a big guy and it feels perfect.",85296,4
85296,"just a little too warm... i was not expecting that, but for now they are just fine",85296,4
85298,I purchased this watch back in March to replace my old one.,85298,4
85298,The only bad thing I can say is that the battery for the lights part didn't last too long before it died.,85298,4
85298,Other than that its a beautiful watch that arrived soon than expected and overall I'm pleased with my purchase.,85298,4
85299,"They looked cool, just way too small.",85299,4
85300,good price good product,85300,4
85302,"I have seen similar items to this piece that cost more and are made of a thicker material, however they do not fit as well as this one.",85302,4
85302,"It is very thin, I would suggest wearing this on a warm day or night if you simply don't want to walk around with your arms uncovered.",85302,4
85302,I have big arms that I am self-conscious about and this does the trick.,85302,4
85302,"Also, the shipping was relatively quick.",85302,4
85304,"Very pretty , I love it!",85304,4
85305,They some times fall off my feet.,85305,4
85305,Especially if I am doing a lot of walking in my flats.,85305,4
85306,Take the advice of those that encourage you to go 2 sizes higher than your normal jacket size.,85306,4
85306,"It also ships rather fast, which is amazing.",85306,4
85307,The glasses look %100 MURICAN.,85307,4
85307,I really enjoy wearing them by the pool and at church.,85307,4
85307,I would totally try to drive in them but my wife won't let me.,85307,4
85307,glasses only obscure %40 of your vision,85307,4
85308,"Beautiful cover, the only thing i noticed is that it snags very easily.",85308,4
85310,"look nice, a little smaller then the picture but still big enough to fit most college books.",85310,4
85311,Nice and long for tall women like myself...love!,85311,4
85311,But must order your correct size...I went up a size and they're too big.,85311,4
85312,"Attractive, lightweight straight skirt with stretchy material that allows for easy movement.",85312,4
85313,Wonderful color and weight.,85313,4
85313,"Size fits most, if not all.",85313,4
85313,Don't lose small pieces though!!,85313,4
85314,"Nice nightgown, great comfortable material.",85314,4
85314,"Was a little small, usually wear a 3 x but bought 4 X.",85314,4
85314,"Because it is 100% cotton, knew it would shrink a little.",85314,4
85315,All three of my sons like these!,85315,4
85316,I'm 5'2 about 120 32b.,85316,4
85316,Straps on bra and waist thingy are adjustable.,85316,4
85316,I've used it a couple times but don't think it will last very long.,85316,4
85316,"But for the price and my first impression when I pulled it out of the bag, staying intact for one use was surprising.",85316,4
85317,"My wife liked it when I gave it to her, but she hasn't worn it.",85317,4
85317,I think she is waiting to have one of the daughters to come home to help her put it on the first time.,85317,4
85318,"Didn't expect it to be somewhat snug ,I excpected x=large would be a little bigger, but it is very soft and comfy.",85318,4
85318,I recommend for those who are plus size like I am if you wamt to have an extra tight T- shirt then this is it.,85318,4
85319,"This is my new favorite summer dress, It keeps me cool and stylish!",85319,4
85319,A great fit for both busty ladies and slender body types.,85319,4
85320,"Cute and durable, just what I expected.",85320,4
85320,Good as a gift also.,85320,4
85321,"These work well to keep out the Tucson sun - only thing is that they are very stiff plastic, but that might be a plus to some.",85321,4
85321,"Pretty durable things, too, since I've managed to sit on them a few time with no breakage.",85321,4
85321,Also very stylish if I might add.,85321,4
85322,Let me start by saying this is a beautiful bag!,85322,4
85322,"It is good quality leather, very well-made with gorgeous details.",85322,4
85322,"The matching wallet is slender, has its own carry strap for when you want to travel light, and it is a total bonus for this price.",85322,4
85322,There are just a couple of things that could functionally be better.,85322,4
85322,"The description says the purse is 12""w x 9""h, which it is when measured to the top of the scalloped top.",85322,4
85322,"But the main zipper closure is 3 1/2"" below the top of the scallop, making the actual storage area of the purse much smaller, really only 5 1/2"" high.",85322,4
85322,(Note to the manufacturer that the zipper really doesn't have to be that far down.,85322,4
85322,"It could be at least another 1 1/2"" closer to the top to give more capacity without sacrificing the appearance.)",85322,4
85322,The outside cell phone pocket is too shallow to comfortably accommodate today's smartphones.,85322,4
85322,The gun compartment is amply sized to accommodate my compact semi-auto pistol.,85322,4
85322,"However, it lacks a holster and the soft inside lining allows for too much movement.",85322,4
85322,So I used a velcro-sided holster from another bag to add structure but will have to add some loop velcro to the lining of the compartment so it stays put when drawing.,85322,4
85322,"Again, this is a gorgeous, well-made bag with just a few functional flaws.",85322,4
85322,I still love it and get lots of compliments!,85322,4
85323,My wife is very happy with the product and it fits nicely.,85323,4
85323,She says it is very comfortable fit.,85323,4
85325,It looks the way it is fits well,85325,4
85326,My boyfriend loves it,85326,4
85327,The set arrived before  expected so I was super please about that.,85327,4
85327,"I absolutely love the color, the look and the capacity of both the 21"" upright and the dowel.",85327,4
85327,"However, I am very underwhelmed with how the 21"" rolls; it certainly does not roll smoothly particularly when I am rolling it alongside me.",85327,4
85327,It performs better when I am pulling it behind me which is not what I expected from spinner capabilities.,85327,4
85328,it was just like you see it.,85328,4
85328,already got lots of comments......Thanks,85328,4
85329,Room to wash and shrink.,85329,4
85330,Early delivery looks like the pictures and my son will  be getting it for his birthday this coming weekend!!,85330,4
85331,i ordered 2 sizes larger and it JUST fits....but very cute!,85331,4
85332,Way too big to wear right now but it's super cute so he can wear it later,85332,4
85333,"It is what it is, fits when you tie it.",85333,4
85333,Did the job for Halloween.,85333,4
85335,But there were a title bigger than I anticipated.,85335,4
85336,The first one I ordered was a small and too small for my birthday 15 year old who usually wears a small.,85336,4
85336,I reordered it Ina medium and it fit well.,85336,4
85337,I liked them I got them for a costume so they got the job done and note they are a little tight at the top where the red is but I expected that because I have pretty big thighs and they had a slight tendency to falling down but I just wore flesh colored pantyhose and it fixed those problems I wear a size 9-10 in jeans and I'm 5'2 if that helps anyone,85337,4
85338,I love this cardigan but the sleeves are half the size as shown.,85338,4
85339,I like the hat and the way it fits but hate the little  metal pin that says fashion.,85339,4
85339,I just took it off.,85339,4
85340,"Good looking, well made cap.",85340,4
85340,I've had a few snapback lids and this one seems to be slightly small.,85340,4
85340,Fits around the head as most would but there is less room than most inside the cap.,85340,4
85340,So it has more of a tendency to point upward than all of my other caps and trucker caps.,85340,4
85340,I have a large head so it may not bother others.,85340,4
85340,I still like it and will wear it as much as any other.,85340,4
85342,Cant quite see the bat symbol since it sits inside the tunnel but its still cute,85342,4
85343,Very high quality product.,85343,4
85343,I'm glad I checked the size chart.,85343,4
85343,This is my second order.,85343,4
85344,This dress was perfect and just as described.,85344,4
85344,I received it last week in the mail and wore it the next day because I just loved it.,85344,4
85344,This dress is made of a stretchy material that just works so well for all different body types.,85344,4
85344,"I also really liked the coloring of this piece because it matches so much of what I wear, especially if you're someone who wears mostly black.",85344,4
85344,The product fit very close to size and looks great alone or with stockings!,85344,4
85344,I wore it as an everyday outfit but it is so versatile you can go straight from day to night out in this!,85344,4
85345,Beautiful eye catching bag !,85345,4
85345,"Was very excited to receive it..
Large size tote
Inside has Id card slot, money compartment, small compartment and a zipper pocket
Front of the bag has a zipper pocket
Light weight
Design and quality are amazing, the studs on sides are attached into the leather, so it doesn't come off.",85345,4
85345,"There is no layer of leather or buttons attached at the outside bottom of the bag so there are more chances of bag getting dirty, since its a lighter shade.",85345,4
85345,Not a major issue though.,85345,4
85346,"Great idea, good execution.",85346,4
85346,"While nursing, I measure a 34C/D and i chose to size up and get a small.",85346,4
85346,"it is fairly tight throughout, which is nice to wear as an underlayer, but puts a little more pressure on my chest than I would prefer and is also not so flattering to the post-partum body.",85346,4
85346,I would prefer it bigger with a little stretch.,85346,4
85346,The elastic works well on my bravado body silk bras.,85346,4
85346,I got the mint color and it is lovely.,85346,4
85347,"For the price, I'm impressed.",85347,4
85347,"I didn't want to spend much on such an item, so I took a chance.",85347,4
85347,"I'm a curvy/hour glass shape girl, 5ft 138lbs and I was worried it wouldn't fit.",85347,4
85347,"The stockings only reasonably work as knee highs, and the vest top is kind of stupid looking, but the skirt surprisingly fit as pictured.",85347,4
85347,I put in a tight button up tied up instead and it looked pretty hot.,85347,4
85347,Looking forward to surprising husband with it.,85347,4
85348,Good and helpful; night driving is better.,85348,4
85348,"They don't reduce the glare completely, however.",85348,4
85349,purchased for my son.. he is happy with the belt.,85349,4
85350,These hats are nicely made and fit well.,85350,4
85350,The material is soft and they are exactly as pictured.,85350,4
85350,I was pleasantly surprised with the quality for the price.,85350,4
85351,A bit larger than expected but nothing a bit of hemming can do!,85351,4
85351,"Lightweight and durable, stunning and fancy-pants!",85351,4
85352,Fit well get lint balls,85352,4
85353,This is a pretty sweet little watch.,85353,4
85353,The band is a decent quality rubber sports style band.,85353,4
85353,"The size, if you have no other reference, might be in a unisex range.",85353,4
85353,"Not a tiny face, nor overcompensatingly large, because why?",85353,4
85353,"Obviously cheap plastic bling, just how I like my bling.",85353,4
85353,"Stainless steel back and metal, painted housing under the plastic bezel.",85353,4
85353,"Should have decent staying power, not bad for under $10.",85353,4
85354,This was a gift and was a little tight around the waist.,85354,4
85354,If you are a fan of FNAFF you will like this t!,85354,4
85355,These rings are perfect.,85355,4
85355,My girlfriend loved hers and the only bad part was I didn't realize there was Nickle in the ring ( which I'm allergic to) to I have to wear it on a chain..,85355,4
85355,Otherwise I love these rings.,85355,4
85356,The top fit Peru it the.,85356,4
85356,It bottoms were a bit too small but I'm keeping it!,85356,4
85356,I wish that I could have purchased it at seperate sizes.,85356,4
85356,"Overall, I love the set!",85356,4
85357,"The white portion was a little see through, but great as a cover up!",85357,4
85358,"I am about 5'5"" and it is just the right length, so if you are much taller it may be too short.",85358,4
85358,The print looks just like the photo!,85358,4
85358,I ordered the XL and usually wear size 16 in pants.,85358,4
85358,"I carry most of my weight in my butt and hips rather than my stomach, and this dress was a little clingy in those areas, I could have gotten the 1X instead of the XL.",85358,4
85358,But it still fits great and I like it a lot!,85358,4
85359,"looks so cute like picture, length is good, came SUPER fast/early, the only reason that this isn't a 5 is the bust doesnt fit me i ordered an XL anticipating this problem, but it was too small :(",85359,4
85360,Cheap way to keep your shades without scratches.,85360,4
85360,Nothing fancy but practical.,85360,4
85361,"Love the color, love the fabric.",85361,4
85361,It is super comfortable.,85361,4
85361,The only reason i gave it a 4 Star is because it was big on me so i jad to take it to the taylor.,85361,4
85361,Other than that it is super cute,85361,4
85362,Beautiful and well made.,85362,4
85363,Great shirt for my kids but seemed like they ran a size large.,85363,4
85363,"Like, the Small is like a Medium.",85363,4
85363,I guess they'll have them for a while though.,85363,4
85364,Arrived in a timely fashion.,85364,4
85364,I'm pretty sad though that the hemitite plugs are the next size up (2g).,85364,4
85364,I will have to wait another month before I can try them out.,85364,4
85366,I was hoping the print would be more vibrant .,85366,4
85368,"I did have to cut down the length of the tassels as they got tangled and didn't look good, but otherwise I like it.",85368,4
85368,Careful to hand wash and dry.,85368,4
85369,I  really enjoy it!,85369,4
85370,The size fits great but after the first wash like a lot of clothes it shrinks just enough to still be comfortable.,85370,4
85372,"Good product, well made.",85372,4
85373,"Not bad quality, great for a lounging suit.",85373,4
85373,"However, it was just too small for me.",85373,4
85374,My friend loved it!,85374,4
85374,Great birthday present and really classic!,85374,4
85374,"16"" is definitely too small for an adult though; wish I would have bought a longer size.",85374,4
85374,"Her 5 year loves wearing ""Mommy's NEW Necklace!""",85374,4
85374,:) Would recommend this product to friends!,85374,4
85375,"good quality, will add comfort to some of my shoes and boots that have zippers.",85375,4
85375,it is not for cowboy boots.,85375,4
85376,"The material is a little thinner, and maybe a little shorter than I was expecting - however, I'm enjoying them with each wearing.",85376,4
85376,I wash on cold and hang dry.,85376,4
85376,"When I shop ""higher end"" clothing - I'm always a perfect Medium/8-10...I felt I took a risk ordering a Medium from a ""made in China"" product - as their mediums usually fit like an extra small, however, this particular shirt fits as expected.",85376,4
85376,I bought it in both black and gray.,85376,4
85376,"These are my new ""go-to"" tops for the weekend...I feel dressed up in a t-shirt!",85376,4
85376,I can recommend this shirt.,85376,4
85377,Very useful for travel and quality product.,85377,4
85378,Like it but skirt is a bit short.,85378,4
85378,"I am a 5'2"" and ordered a Medium.",85378,4
85379,Was exactly what our granddaughter wanted.,85379,4
85380,It fit as I expected it to and it is very comfortable.,85380,4
85381,Great except for runs a bit small.,85381,4
85382,Love the long length,85382,4
85384,Fits like a glove.,85384,4
85384,They were even long enough for my long legs.,85384,4
85384,Very pleased with these leggings.,85384,4
85385,"These are comfortable for running, but run extremely small.",85385,4
85385,"I purchased the Medium 8, was hesitant that they might be too big, but probably should have bought the large.",85385,4
85386,Great price and they fit well.,85386,4
85387,"It's beautiful, but even smaller than expected.",85387,4
85387,"Keep in mind too that it's not very long, it barely covers my waist.",85387,4
85389,It's thinner than I thought.,85389,4
85390,I like it for sure but this is definitely a jr. sizing.,85390,4
85392,"It looked huge when I took it out of the package but once I put it on and adjusted the straps, pant legs, and draw string it fit great.",85392,4
85392,Unfortunately the straps popped on the first time wearing so if you have a good hand with a needle and thread...tighted up those seams beforehand.,85392,4
85392,Other than that it was a good buy!,85392,4
85394,"The sunglasses look and feel nice, just wish I could have gotten the ones that can really hide my eyes",85394,4
85395,I'm giving this 4 stars because of inconsistency of products shipped.,85395,4
85395,"While the watchband I ordered from this seller arrieved on time and has had 0 problems and clasps nice and firm, I suggested this exact product to a couple friends and their experience varied wildly, one had a slightly different mesh pattern, and another the clasp didn't hold very well.",85395,4
85395,"If you get a good one like I did, its AMAZING, buy with caution.",85395,4
85396,Bought for my husband because his roommate had one that he likes to use.,85396,4
85396,The paint it quality and it is a good size.,85396,4
85397,"Size runs small, nice material and style",85397,4
85398,I really like this dress .Its a nice summer dress.,85398,4
85399,somewhat tight but it works fine,85399,4
85400,I didn't really like the fit that much and the way it hung on me but its a pretty top.,85400,4
85401,Good uniform shoe -- easy on and off.,85401,4
85401,My son loves it because it looks like a man's business shoe.,85401,4
85401,I stick with Sperry Shoes because they are durable.,85401,4
85401,I can pass them down to my younger kids.,85401,4
85401,Pricey but worth it.,85401,4
85402,Excellent ring for tree price!,85402,4
85402,Just dragons aren't very distinctive.,85402,4
85402,You have to look closely to tell they're dragons.,85402,4
85402,Other than that great ring!,85402,4
85403,"Although this product took forever in the mail, I really love this hip scarf.",85403,4
85403,It is great to wear for my belly-dance classes.,85403,4
85404,"Great glasses, but the lenses are a bit small for women's glasses.",85404,4
85404,"However, they are made very well, and were in perfect condition.",85404,4
85405,It bigger than I expected but it's very pretty.,85405,4
85406,The fit and cut of this dress is great.,85406,4
85406,"I do wish it wasn't quite so short in the middle (front and back), but I know that's part of the idea.",85406,4
85406,This could be a year-round dress with leggings.,85406,4
85407,"This look well made, but is a little bit small, and are not very shiny, maybe better to wear on Helix or Orbital not good for standard lobe, this is for 1 earing only",85407,4
85408,Its thin and not like the picture but its still cute.,85408,4
85409,Runs small definitely go up a size or 2.,85409,4
85409,Also you can see through it so keep that in mind for undergarments.,85409,4
85410,The Belly Bandit fit's great but when you apply the Velcro it ends up sticking crooked especially when trying to make it tight.,85410,4
85411,Bought for my ten year old in XS.,85411,4
85411,Fit a little large as expected but she loved it.,85411,4
85411,"Not sweatshirt material, more like a thin nylon/jersey material.",85411,4
85412,These look cool and are of good quality.,85412,4
85412,"I have been sporting them for months now, with no complaints.",85412,4
85412,"I don't wear them daily, but when I do I find them comfortable and well fitted.",85412,4
85413,"Cute and flowy, but buy a size up.",85413,4
85414,its nice  it does the thing thing,85414,4
85416,"Cute shoes, but they run a little large, and they are wide.",85416,4
85418,Nice shirt.. my daughter loved it!,85418,4
85419,Construction could be better.,85419,4
85419,I ordered a small.,85419,4
85419,"It is barely big enough to close in front, but is not tight.",85419,4
85419,"It gaps open a tiny bit, so I wish I had ordered a medium or large.",85419,4
85419,"I am 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34D.",85419,4
85419,Order right size though.,85419,4
85419,"I ordered it in purple as well, and they send me an XXL which is silly because I ordered a small, but I actually like the fit of the large one better.",85419,4
85419,"It fits more like a robe, but is definitely larger.",85419,4
85419,I would give 5 stars if it wasn't for messy looking construction.,85419,4
85419,"However, I just ordered another in size XL.",85419,4
85419,"I like the looser, comfy fit.",85419,4
85419,"Honestly guys and gals, for the price, this is really nice and I would order more if they had more colors.",85419,4
85419,I got black and purple.,85419,4
85420,Perfect for the summer.,85420,4
85420,Will definitely replace yearly.,85420,4
85421,I just wish they had elastic fabric string rather than an elastic plastic band...but it's cool once you don't abuse it.,85421,4
85421,I also wonder if it's real tigers eye...It's so perfectly shiny and glossy.,85421,4
85421,Overall I like it!,85421,4
85422,It's cute and nice quality.,85422,4
85422,It runs small though I ordered a size 8 but fit it to fit how I want it to I think I'd need a 12.,85422,4
85422,I want it loose.,85422,4
85422,The 8 guys really tight and the lining needs  to be 2 inches longer to cover my stomach.,85422,4
85422,I'm sure a 10 would fit but most likely not as I want it to.,85422,4
85424,I ordered this as a costume shirt for my husband to wear.,85424,4
85424,It is light weight (which is a plus in this summer heat!),85424,4
85424,and the colors are bright.,85424,4
85424,He has worn it a few times and it doesn't shrink when washed.,85424,4
85424,"It is roomy enough for him to be comfortable, not not so big that it hangs on him.",85424,4
85424,"All in all,  very satisfied with this purchase.",85424,4
85425,Was very pleased with the fit of the jumpsuit the belt was a bit snug but I can buy my own belt.,85425,4
85425,Material is very complimentary to my body and love the spandex like feeling!,85425,4
85426,"I really liked it, but unfortunately it was slightly too small.",85426,4
85426,"The sizing chart was actually fairly accurate, but slight differences in build are difficult to account for.",85426,4
85426,"The sleeves, however, were nice and long, the way they should be.",85426,4
85427,"I love this dress, other than the fact that it is about half a size too big.",85427,4
85427,I got a medium after consulting the size chart: I should have just gone with my gut and gotten a small.,85427,4
85427,"I am in the process of exchanging the dress, because it is lovely apart from being too big.",85427,4
85428,"I always forget my readers and with these I can always get my email, texts, etc.",85428,4
85428,Of course I end up using them for more than just my phone.,85428,4
85428,After about 10 months the corner of the case came off and I don't recall dropping it but I still expect after it no longer stays on the phone I will get another.,85428,4
85428,The glasses are not a good fashion statement but at least you can see when you need to.,85428,4
85428,They stay on your nose well but are not going to work well if you plan on moving around much but again they are always there and completely unnoticeable on your phone.,85428,4
85428,I recommend them and will purchase them again.,85428,4
85429,"I measure as a small, but my butt looks a little strange under clothes.",85429,4
85429,I think a size larger would look better.,85429,4
85429,"Makes the tummy look good, though.",85429,4
85430,Very nice hat for the price.,85430,4
85430,"Lightweight, but not flimsy.",85430,4
85431,Very see through though.,85431,4
85432,"Not as soft as I would like, but the material is sturdy and the shirt holds up well in the wash.",85432,4
85433,I got this for my step mother for Christmas.,85433,4
85433,"She's hard to shop for.. and can easily afford whatever she wants, so I try to find things she wouldn't buy herself but that I think she might like.",85433,4
85433,"This one is nice in theory, the fit is just fine.",85433,4
85433,"She's a curvy 12-14, so 14 in a dress - and this fit her well.",85433,4
85433,"BUT it's sort of cheap, unflattering material.",85433,4
85433,You'd probably want to wear a slip with it and/or a body shaper of sorts - something to smooth everything out.,85433,4
85433,"Nothing against how it looked on her, I think she looked nice, but she felt very self conscious about wearing it.",85433,4
85433,"I'm fairly certain it'll never make a public debut, but it's a nice dress.",85433,4
85433,"Just know it's that form-fitting, tight-but-strechy-enough material.. where you feel comfortable enough but it's going to show nooks and crannies if you have any.",85433,4
85434,seem to be good quality but post part that goes through ear is larger than regular stud or maybe it's because its flat and not pointed either way good product,85434,4
85435,Cute cheap jewelry for little girls to dress up with.,85435,4
85437,I like it but the zipper is not great.,85437,4
85437,I have you have to be careful zipping.,85437,4
85439,Not too bulky so can wear it all day at work.,85439,4
85440,This is a beautiful purse.,85440,4
85440,Do not be put off that it has flowers on it and it is not the usual dooney.,85440,4
85440,"The colors are not overwhelming, and the navy blue leather pieces, top this purse of nicely.",85440,4
85440,The size would be considered a medium in the dooney world.,85440,4
85441,Bought several of these as a gift/gag.,85441,4
85441,"Fit nicely, material isn't the best as far as durability, but adequate for the price.",85441,4
85442,I love the look of these.,85442,4
85442,I've gotten a lot of compliments every time I wear them.,85442,4
85442,The waist is high too so it covers my post baby stomach issues I hate.,85442,4
85442,"My only complaint is that the black ""netting/mesh"" part is somewhat scratchy which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",85442,4
85442,I would order another pair so I guess it doesn't bother me that much!,85442,4
85444,These laces are fire...but a bit short for my preference.,85444,4
85445,"I ordered/received this hat, but wasn't quite what expected.",85445,4
85445,I wanted more of a suedo conservative cowboy type hat; this was more of a an Indiana Jones hat trying to be a cowboy hat.,85445,4
85445,But still a nice dapper hat if looking for a daily out and about/weather hat.,85445,4
85445,It's well made with good thick felt.,85445,4
85445,"One other thing, many of the Amazon reviews conveyed that the hat runs large.",85445,4
85445,"I wear a 7 1/8, so I ordered a Small even though the size chart indicated Medium.",85445,4
85445,Well the hat was too small......not by much but definitely tight....and would be headache tight if wore for long.,85445,4
85445,So my experience is that it fits as advertised.,85445,4
85445,If I were to exchange I would get a Medium for my 7 1/8 head/hat size.,85445,4
85446,Wore these to my Daughter's Wedding and they were comfortable and pretty at the same time..,85446,4
85447,This bag was great for my trip thru Italy.,85447,4
85447,Could carry so much.,85447,4
85447,Very comfortable to use,85447,4
85448,This is a really nice dress just that you should purchase a size up.,85448,4
85449,"Very happy with how the outfit turned out, however, the bow was too small for my 12 month old's head (and she actually is in the 25th percentile for head size).",85449,4
85449,"Also the outfit fit my 12 month but was baggy in the shirt area, (which didn't bother me, but I can't imagine putting a 6 month old in this outfit as it would just swallow them!)",85449,4
85449,I was very happy with the length since my daughter is tall and I was worried it would be too short on her.,85449,4
85449,"You can see how baggy the shirt is on her in the photo, the tutu was purchased separately.",85449,4
85451,Good quality product...exactly as described,85451,4
85452,I am very pleased with this sweater.,85452,4
85452,I have received many compliments when wearing it.,85452,4
85452,I read all the reviews before ordering and was hesitant on making this purchase but my reasons for buying were based on the fact that I wanted a sweater to kick around the house so if it wasn't a great sweater then no harm done.,85452,4
85452,This turned out to be a pretty decent sweater after all.,85452,4
85452,"In fact, I went ahead and ordered the other color offered.",85452,4
85452,It's really comfortable and looks really cute with a pair of leggings and some boots.,85452,4
85452,I chose a large because I wanted that over-sized look to it.,85452,4
85452,I usually take a medium.,85452,4
85452,It has just the exact look that I wanted.,85452,4
85452,I'm glad I didn't go by all the negative reviews.,85452,4
85452,The picture shown is exactly what it looks like.,85452,4
85452,"And when putting it on you don't just fold down the 'collar', you have to pull the fabric apart from itself in order to achieve the look shown in the picture.",85452,4
85453,They are pretty but are too big,85453,4
85454,"Very hard to walk in, but so cute.",85454,4
85455,"Love the Turquoise look, but butterflies with rose bodies are a bit girly for my taste.",85455,4

85456,Look great and are what I expected.,85456,4
85456,Had a funny smell when I got them and had to wash them right away.,85456,4
85457,Took 12 days to arrive but cute!,85457,4
85457,It's def a crop top though!,85457,4
85458,It is also very comfortable.,85458,4
85458,My one problem with this is that I tighten the straps every morning but by sometime in the afternoon I find my self tighten them again.,85458,4
85458,They won't stay tightened.,85458,4
85460,"Beautiful boots, ptetty brown color.",85460,4
85460,"However,  I wear an 8 1/2 in most shoes,  and got a 9 in these.",85460,4
85460,I'm  going to have to order another pair in a size 10 so my toes won't be scrunched up!,85460,4
85461,Its stylish and light and comfortable.,85461,4
85461,I only wish that the fabric was not burnout.,85461,4
85461,"The white stripes are burn-out, the black is terrycloth.",85461,4
85463,"I like it very much, it's vaporous, then it's perfect for my country that is tropical",85463,4
85465,Made well for the price!,85465,4
85466,I  like everything about this bag except the smell.,85466,4
85466,"I've purchased other Scarleton bags that had a faint smell when first opened,that didn't take long for the odor to go away.",85466,4
85466,The smell of this bag made the room smell.,85466,4
85466,Tried about everything I know.,85466,4
85466,I even left out side.,85466,4
85466,The smell is almost gone.,85466,4
85466,If it wasn't that I really liked the bag I would have returned it.,85466,4
85466,"If after placing odor eaters in it the smell is gone,I will return it.",85466,4
85468,Arrived wrinkled but that's ok.,85468,4
85468,The cat color needs some smoothing.,85468,4
85468,The material is a bit artificial but for the price I would say it's pretty well-made.,85468,4
85468,It's a delightful item that's sure to be a whimsical addition to your wardrobe.,85468,4
85469,A good travel bag for small items,85469,4
85470,My son loved it.,85470,4
85470,And has got many nice complements.,85470,4
85471,"Very nice
, good fit!'",85471,4

85473,Great sunnies at a great price.,85473,4
85474,Where it all the time with my other hippie jewelry.,85474,4
85475,The adjusters rub a bit.,85475,4
85475,Otherwise a good product.,85475,4
85476,the bra fits as expected I lie it and the bottom doesn't fully cover my booty but idc after all I'm going to the beach anyways,85476,4
85478,"Great shirt, fits well.",85478,4
85479,It came in on the soonest  day that it told me.,85479,4
85479,"I am very happy with the leggings i got, the size is the tiniest bit of loose but in my case i like it and they seem a bit longer than my legs but yet again another thing i usually like in my leggings.",85479,4
85479,Fabric is actually like a silk soft and they are thin but they trap heat well.,85479,4
85479,I am not saying your order will turn out like mine because we all have different body sizes and live in different areas so it may not ship as fast but i am very happy with my leggings.,85479,4
85480,"A very nice little ring, well made and comfortable to wear.",85480,4
85481,Love the colors but the legs are a little loose at the ankles...,85481,4
85481,Nothing a quick sew can't fix,85481,4
85482,Its what I was looking for.,85482,4
85483,"Fits as expected, zipper doesn't seem to stay zipped up.",85483,4
85484,My daughter LOVES it.,85484,4
85484,She ordered an --large because she read that it runs small.,85484,4
85484,She is an average sized young teen and it fits her slightly big.,85484,4
85484,I would say it runs a little small.,85484,4
85485,"Really truly ugly, but that's the point.",85485,4
85485,"Great sweater, popular everytime I wear it.",85485,4
85486,"Pros: seamless fit; Immediately flattened waist for times when want waist to look flat before stomach actually gets flat
Con: hooks that usually require help in order to keep initial hooks from unhooking as try to continue hooking others",85486,4
85487,The tone of gold color is a little too strong (too yellow) for me.,85487,4
85488,"The costume is cute and perfect for my daughter, but one size fits all!?!",85488,4
85488,It just fits my daughter who is 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds.,85488,4
85488,I'm a bit heavier than that and there's no way I would fit it into it.,85488,4
85488,"Also, not the best material, but for one Halloween night it would be fine.",85488,4
85489,"The Michael Jordan is covered when you wear it though, no fault to the seller, just a poor design.",85489,4
85489,If the Michael Jordan was centered it'd be more ideal but it works just fine,85489,4
85490,too small so I gave to my sister she loved it,85490,4
85491,Very light weight and good for a female/smaller face.,85491,4
85493,"Once I figured out how to use them, and which sizes work the best for me, they're actually pretty neat and really work (not freaky huge fake looking plump lips like teenagers using shot glasses on videos, but a more natural looking fullness.)",85493,4
85494,"Fits well, shapes like it says it should material pulls easily",85494,4
85496,It looks very sexy on.,85496,4
85497,I like the tree and the colors of the beads.,85497,4
85498,Size is good with good quality material.,85498,4
85498,My Irish husband loves it!,85498,4
85499,Strap is too short,85499,4
85500,Just what my granddaughter wanted.,85500,4
85501,I'm really happy with this sweatshirt.,85501,4
85501,"It's comfortable and it's not made of a thin, cheap material.",85501,4
85501,The only issue with it is that the egg patterns are a little more faded than what is shown in the picture.,85501,4
85501,Other than that I'd consider it a solid purchase.,85501,4
85502,I got the green color and its beautiful!,85502,4
85502,I love the fabric ..it flows so nicely.,85502,4
85502,I haven't had a problem with the necklace part as others have but it does snag on my hair and pulls at them.,85502,4
85502,I ordered the small -im 5'4'' 109 lbs and its a little big-esp the top part but its not a deal breaker.,85502,4
85502,looks very elegant and its just like a dress you would buy at bloomingdales for over $100... def worth it!,85502,4
85503,These are long bars.,85503,4
85503,"I wasn't paying attention to the sizing when I ordered but you can tell in the photos provided by the manufacture that the clear one is the shortest, the only one with a short bar.",85503,4
85503,"Other than that, they're all super cute and look just like the photos.",85503,4
85504,Great dress and fit was ok but more form fit than expected from other reviews and description.i am 5'0 and 112 bought size small.,85504,4
85504,Some people may like the more close fit but i am not comfortable with it 'hugging' tummy.,85504,4
85505,Arm cut-outs are a lot smaller than what the picture shows.,85505,4
85506,I get many compliments on these.,85506,4
85506,Note: It is a little difficult to find the right hole in the backing because of the many holes in the earring.,85506,4
85507,sleeves were 1/2 an inch longer,85507,4
85508,"I'm 5""3 and 148 pounds.",85508,4
85508,I ordered Large because of my cocos..36C and the bra covered perfectly.,85508,4
85509,"The shirt itself is lovely, but the size I selected (6) ended up being too large for me, and the sleeves were too short.",85509,4
85509,"I would gladly exchange it for a smaller size, but the sleeves would be even shorter.",85509,4
85509,The only other facet of the shirt that I did not particularly care for was that the crochet portion dangled at the ends.,85509,4
85509,"It looked lovely on the ladies who displayed pictures in the reviews, and the quality was not bad at all for the price.",85509,4
85509,It just didn't fit me right.,85509,4
85511,"Great product, stones and material are darker than shown in picture.",85511,4
85512,A slim fit version would have been perfect.,85512,4
85514,Ran a little small,85514,4
85515,These are tight on my head but are otherwise great.,85515,4
85515,Shipping was quick and the quality is great.,85515,4
85515,I live in Colorado and these keep me warm on those cold mornings heading into work.,85515,4
85515,"My only complaint is that I have a small head and they are tight, almost pressing too hard on my ears.",85515,4
85515,Hopefully this eases with time and wear.,85515,4
85516,"Softer and less supportive than the Saxx Fiesta, but still really comfortable.",85516,4
85517,Watch seems to be doing what it should.,85517,4
85517,One exception is that the watch band is too tight on my wrist.,85517,4
85517,I am a big man so will try to find an economical black band.,85517,4
85517,Do you sell a. larger black band that will fit my solar watch?,85517,4
85518,"Nice shirt, worth the price and well made,  shipping was a little slow",85518,4
85519,"Love it but a little smaller than expected, couldn't tell it was hands for leaves.",85519,4
85520,The split it the front is centered more than side and its cut kinda short...I thought it would be knee length but it's not.,85520,4
85520,My bump is really round so it made it open up whenever I walked and u saw my goodies.,85520,4
85520,Maybe a good postpartum dress but not work for me now.,85520,4
85521,"This is very cute, looks just like the photo.",85521,4
85521,"The material is soft, however I am a size ten and this is very snug.",85521,4
85521,"When you see one size fits all, it means probably a size 6 or less.",85521,4
85522,my sister love it,85522,4
85523,Will be very warm and cozy.,85523,4
85524,I don't think its the best looking bag around but it dose the job.,85524,4
85524,It is small enough to fit under the seat on a plain but I was able to fit a surprisingly lot of stuff into such a little bag.,85524,4
85524,It's a great  for the times you don't need to check a bag.,85524,4
85526,Little small on the butt.,85526,4
85526,But looks great and feels really nice.,85526,4
85527,Very cute and protects against sun but the navy is not as dark as the picture !,85527,4
85530,They're pretty cheap quality and keep stretching as I wear them,85530,4
85531,Very nice coloring and material but it ran small.,85531,4
85532,Love this cute little skirt!,85532,4
85532,"Pretty pattern, falls nicely.",85532,4
85532,"It's a little too big in the waist,  the Velcro fasteners barely attach, but the skirt stays on, so I'm keeping it.",85532,4
85532,"I am 5'6"", 125 lbs, I ordered a small (do have a small waist).",85532,4
85532,"I want the other color too, it's s great little summer skirt & it stays modest even when the wind blows!",85532,4
85533,"It fits a little snug, but I love it.",85533,4
85537,"Bought for son, lost it next day, found some weeks later.",85537,4
85537,Son really loves it.,85537,4
85538,"it is okay, becomes a bit uncomfortable if I wear them for a couple of hours",85538,4
85539,"Hat is nice, but had to stuff cotton balls in the inside rim so it wouldn't fall off after measuring my husbands head prior to ordering.",85539,4
85539,Thought it would be ok but guess not.,85539,4
85539,Too much hassle to bother shipping back.,85539,4
85539,Hat is good quality though.,85539,4
85541,"Love the colors and size, also the pocket is large enough to place items such as money, passport, etc.",85541,4
85542,"Looks great, but beads hanging off frequently get in the way of things.",85542,4
85543,"My boy is 20 months old and is 25 lbs, it is soft and comfortable.",85543,4
85543,My son had no complaints or problem when he wore it.,85543,4
85543,The collars and everything that you can see are all prints.,85543,4
85543,But a lot of people recognized him on a toxedo.,85543,4
85545,"I like the fit, but the material is sorta cheap",85545,4
85546,"I love the idea of earmuffs without the wire over my head, but I'm not sure they will stay on in windy weather.",85546,4
85546,"They fit good and are very comfortable, so I'm hoping they will work when the weather gets cold and windy.",85546,4
85547,These sunglasses are very nice.,85547,4
85549,Reviews have said that the sizing is off?,85549,4
85549,LOOK AT THE SIZE CHART :) People seem to default to the kids' age when it comes to size but we have a 5ft tall 9 y.o.,85549,4
85549,"soooo, we bought size 14 and they fit like a glove.",85549,4
85549,The quality is pretty good and we have been searching for pj's for my him that were reasonably priced.,85549,4
85549,These were on sale for $17 and worth every penny!,85549,4
85550,I answered the questions Amazon asked however the shoe runs small you must get a half a size larger,85550,4
85551,"absolutely gorgeous, but so big and blingy that it was not realistic for it to be my engagement ring...that's not saying it looks fake, just that it looks like it would have to cost tens of thousands of dollars which we don't have!",85551,4
85552,I'm 135 and 5'9' and got a medium and the dress fit great!,85552,4
85552,My only complaint is that it's shorter than I'd like.,85552,4
85552,It comes about to my ankles.,85552,4
85552,The cut and material are fantastic!,85552,4
85553,This was a great tool while expanding (pregnant) and not in full-fledged maternity pants.,85553,4
85553,"I could wear this band over unbuttoned (later unzipped, too) work pants and regular jeans until I was about seven and a half months pregnant...then it became too uncomfortable (and my pants' zippers started to peek out at the bottom of the band -- not pretty).",85553,4
85553,"Every woman's pregnancy expansion and way she carries a baby is different, though.",85553,4
85553,My husband even wanted to borrow this band to use over his work pants because he gained some sympathy weight.,85553,4
85554,The color is spot on.,85554,4
85555,These lenses were an economical option to replace very sceatched name brand.,85555,4
85555,I do t use these sunglasses as often as when they were new but now that I have replacement lenses I wear them more often.,85555,4
85555,The replacement lenses fit pretty well.,85555,4
85555,A little more loose than originals and if I were wearing them while very active I might be concerned.,85555,4
85555,They seem to smudge pretty easily but they clean easily with lense cloth.,85555,4
85555,They came with a large cloth case which was nice.,85555,4
85556,Very nice and elegant.,85556,4
85556,"However, it does run small so my recommendation is to order a size bigger that you'll usually wear.. unless, you don't mind very tight.",85556,4
85556,The materia is nice.,85556,4
85557,"I wish the little ""diamonds"" went down further on each side.",85557,4
85557,"However, it's still elegant!",85557,4
85559,My friend's baby must be big.,85559,4
85559,"This was tiny, tiny, tiny.",85559,4
85559,Better to go BIGGER since they grow so fast.,85559,4
85559,And service was great!,85559,4
85560,I kept failing at finding a nose hoop but these are what I was wanting all along.,85560,4
85560,They're easy to bend once their in your nose so you can make them fit to your nostril better.,85560,4
85561,The 12 month size barely fits my petite 6 month old (I haven't washed them yet).,85561,4
85561,As long as they don't shrink we'll be in good shape.,85561,4
85561,"They are so cute so I decided to keep them, (and also they went up in price about 50% when I went to reorder a size that would fit more appropriately...I got mine for almost $13).Amazon was of course great in allowing me to return them if I wanted to, but we'll take our chance with these.",85561,4
85561,"If they shrink to an unusable size when washed, I will try to update this so you know.",85561,4
85562,Nicely made and came ahead of schedule..,85562,4
85563,Color was lighter than expected.,85563,4
85563,We also had read in reviews that sizes fit smaller so we ordered a larger size and it's still smaller than we had expected.,85563,4
85564,I like this dress but don't love it.,85564,4
85564,It somewhat hugs curves and imperfections that you wish it didn't but it is very comfortable and seems well made.,85564,4
85564,It works really well as a swimsuit cover-up too.,85564,4
85564,It can easily be dressed up or down and looks sexy either way.,85564,4
85565,"They were perfectly fine but way too wide for my face, great service
  Joanna",85565,4
85566,I pulled the rivet through the side.,85566,4
85566,Need to use a safety pin to hold it together.,85566,4
85568,Its a nice wig for the pice!,85568,4
85568,It sheds easily and is kina thin but not bad all together!,85568,4
85568,I definitely recommend this wig,85568,4
85569,"I really like the glasses, but a screw fell out only a little while after purchase.",85569,4
85569,I would love to get a replacement screw because I love these glasses.,85569,4
85570,"I'm not sure if it's leather or actually ""pleather"" otherwise I love it!",85570,4
85571,Its a very pretty stone,85571,4
85572,I just got the wrong size but my fiance loved it anyway.,85572,4
85573,show color under white T-shirt,85573,4
85574,Color was much brighter than expected.,85574,4
85575,These look great for fake stones - very pretty,85575,4
85576,The brim of the hat gets floppy when wet.,85576,4
85576,"Other than that, my son loved the hat.",85576,4
85577,I wear this w/ legging.. it's a nice shirt,85577,4
85578,Good quality and fit.,85578,4
85578,There's a lot of strings on the pockets that got annoying right off the bat so I cut them off.,85578,4
85578,They're meant to secure the smaller pocket flaps but I couldn't stand them.,85578,4
85578,Other than that I've worn them countless times and haven't had any problems with the fit or quality.,85578,4
85579,Came as more of a highlighter orange but still super cute!,85579,4
85580,"A bit shorter than I like, I'm 5'4 with 32 25 35 and this is how it fits, I'm not wearing a bra, it's a bit too tight in the waist and I'm assuming it's gonna shrink.",85580,4
85580,If you're going for a skin tight look then it's fine but I was going for something looser.,85580,4
85580,Think I'll get a large.,85580,4
85581,Update:  They have been in contact with me and want to resolve the situation.,85581,4
85581,My best guess is a smaller size was sent to me by mistake from the amazon warehouse as I ordered it through prime or it could have been packaged wrong.,85581,4
85581,"Quality is pretty good and other than the sizing issue I would suggest this belt as a purchase, especially through Heepliday.",85581,4
85581,Bought this knowing there wasn't a lot of reviews and took a chance.,85581,4
85581,"Well it doesn't fit, I always buy a size 42 belt because I conceal carry and my handgun adds 2 inches to my size 39 waist.",85581,4
85581,Even without my holster this thing barely fits my waist and it's marked as being 3 inches larger.,85581,4
85581,Quality seems okay but I will have to return and try a larger size.,85581,4
85581,Will update my review if the replacement is better,85581,4
85582,Nice shoe for my 11 year old.,85582,4
85583,"Receipt of Champions Mens Cotton 6"" was on time.",85583,4
85583,Item was well packaged and no complications were note.,85583,4
85583,"Item was as stated, 100 percent cotton, great for gym shorts and hanging around the house.",85583,4
85583,Will definitely recommend to my friends.,85583,4
85584,"This is a cute outfit, but it is pretty big on my 12 lb 3 month old.",85584,4
85584,"He is average height but a little below average weight, but it is too long.",85584,4
85584,He'll probably fit into it around 6 months.,85584,4
85584,"It's not of the highest quality, but not too cheap either.",85584,4
85584,It would have been great for pictures.,85584,4
85584,I guess he'll wear it on Xmas when he can fit into it!,85584,4
85588,good for fancy occasins,85588,4
85589,"It's a cute, basic black coverup.",85589,4
85589,I'm a size 16 and it covers most of me up.,85589,4
85590,"Very pretty, made a good gift.",85590,4
85591,great color and fit - keeps you very warm,85591,4
85592,the toy was okay for my grandchild.,85592,4
85592,He is a little rough with his toys and this one held up pretty good.,85592,4
85592,The design is pretty good as well.,85592,4
85592,I will say that the toy was put through a lot of banging and throwing around.,85592,4
85592,It is kind of small though.,85592,4
85592,Other than that it is a great toy for little fingers to hold and enjpy.,85592,4
85593,I originally bought a 6 but the garment and package say it is an 8.,85593,4
85593,"However, I did not return it because it fit perfect like this.",85593,4
85593,My hip is 27.4 and the short fits comfortable (8).,85593,4
85593,My breast measure is 35.4 and size 8 fits somewhat small/tight.,85593,4
85593,I'm happy I got an 8 (do not know if by mistake) but I think a 6 would have been too small!,85593,4
85593,"As for comfort, I'm nursing so I found this swimwear very practical.",85593,4
85594,The perfect fit and classy look for a black tie affair.,85594,4
85594,Black tie tradituonally calls for a formal length gown but I chose to go short.,85594,4
85594,I bought a size 8 in this dress and it fit me like a glove.,85594,4
85594,My dress looked just like the picture and I did not even have to steam it out the bag.,85594,4
85594,I do acknowledge what the other reviewers said about the awkward cup placement sewn inside the bodice of the dress.,85594,4
85594,"Since the cups are not sewn indivudually into place, but rather seem to be placed into a sewn upper pocket of the bodice, it does make it easy for them to shift which can be an issue if you're particularly busty or on the opposite end of the spectrum if you're particularly modest in the chest area.",85594,4
85594,This was not my experience though.,85594,4
85594,"Sizing:
The dress does seem to run small so I recommend purchasing a size up, which is why I went with the 8.",85594,4
85594,"Accessories:
Also beware of your accessories!",85594,4
85594,"This dress is heavily designed with lace so be careful with necklaces, rings, bracelets  or handbags that could get caught in the lace and snag the dress with the slightest brush.",85594,4
85594,"In my opinion you do not need a necklace, it takes away from the beauty of the neckline.",85594,4
85594,"Weight:
Lastly, some commented on the weight of dress.",85594,4
85594,The dress does have a satin slip with like a built in petticoat which contributes to the fan out look of the skirt.,85594,4
85594,"I found it to be fairly comfortable and just right, not too heavy.",85594,4
85594,I could still move about freely.,85594,4
85595,Really cute for the price.,85595,4
85595,Wish it came in half sizes though.,85595,4
85596,"Barely covered chest, I only have b cups.",85596,4
85598,I like the shirt however was much smaller than expected.,85598,4
85599,"little too tight for holding more than a card or two, certainly not a wallet replacement, but does look very nice and protects the phone very well.",85599,4
85600,"Super cute, just like the picture.",85600,4
85600,I love the length.,85600,4
85600,It's long enough to cover a long shirt or sweater.,85600,4
85600,I would say it runs small like the other reviews said.,85600,4
85600,"I usually wear a small, but I got a medium and the fit is good.",85600,4
85600,My only complaint is that the sleeves are pretty short.,85600,4
85601,This long-sleeve cover up was exactly what I was looking for because it protects from the sun without leaving a horrible tan line.,85601,4
85601,"Two things I was afraid of before buying this product:
1.",85601,4
85601,That the neck would be too tight (I hate that feeling.,85601,4
85601,It makes me feel claustrophobic).,85601,4
85601,That I would get horrible tan lines on my wrists and neck.,85601,4
85601,"Neither of these were an issue, as the neck had plenty of room and I didn't get ANY tan lines!",85601,4
85601,"However, the fit was smaller than I had expected in other areas.",85601,4
85601,"The arms are slimmer than I thought it would be, as well as the stomach area.",85601,4
85601,I guess I should've known better based on the product image.,85601,4
85601,"The product description and other reviews made it seem as if it were a ""baggy"" fit, so I thought that I could order a size small, and it would be fine.",85601,4
85601,"It fits smaller than I'd like, and is definitely NOT ""baggy.""",85601,4
85601,"Also, the shirt rides up my belly, constantly exposing my pot belly, which is NOT what I want.",85601,4
85601,"But overall, I still like the product and got great use out of it over the summer.",85601,4
85601,I just wish it was a looser fit than the product makes it seem.,85601,4
85601,MY ADVICE: go one size up if you want a looser fit.,85601,4
85602,Im 5'11 and 244 lbs.,85602,4
85602,"It fit a little big, but I would rather it be big than be too small.",85602,4
85602,I gave four stars only because the buttons popped off when I tried the dress on.,85602,4
85602,I will sew them back on myself.,85602,4
85602,Other than that I love the dress.,85602,4
85603,Got this jacket for an upcoming trip to Norway.,85603,4
85603,"I'm 5'5"" and 130 and the medium fit perfectly and left room for my Thermoball Hoodie that I'll be wearing underneath.",85603,4
85603,"Haven't had a chance to wear it in the rain yet, so can't speak to the waterproofness yet, but I think it will be good!",85603,4
85604,I was not interested in the concealed weapon section but it gives me an extra spot to put things.,85604,4
85604,I really ordered this in memory of my 16 year old daughter who passed away.,85604,4
85604,The package arrived earlier than expected and so far I am extremely pleased with it as it was exactly as described.,85604,4
85605,The swimsuit runs small.,85605,4
85605,"I'm 5'7' , 130lbs and 34DD.",85605,4
85605,i ordered a large and it fits perfectly.,85605,4
85605,The material is typical swimsuit fabric with lots of stretch.,85605,4
85605,"I would give this a 5, but i gave it a 4 because there is no structure for the girls (boobs).",85605,4
85605,"If you are well endowed, there is going to be some side-boob peeking out.",85605,4
85605,And this suit is unlikely to work for long torso girls.,85605,4
85605,"That said, I'm thrilled.",85605,4
85606,"It is a beautiful belt , really nice gift box and a nice key chain gift inside.",85606,4
85606,but i am finding the release leaver very hard to work .,85606,4
85606,"I am 66 and a bit overweight so that might be part of the problem , i have talked to a few others and they told me to wear it with casual clothes and break it in before i wear it out of the house for the first time so i can get used to opening it.",85606,4
85606,and loosen it up a bit,85606,4
85607,Has the ray ban p etched on the lenses.,85607,4
85607,And most definitely are polarized:),85607,4
85608,Somewhat small but the material is stretchy so it fits.,85608,4
85608,"Its a bit on the short side, so I wear leggings with the dress.",85608,4
85608,"I love it, its cute and sexy:)",85608,4
85610,"I bought this for my daughter who is a small, I got the medium and it fit perfectly.",85610,4
85611,"Great sweats, just wish it had pockets",85611,4
85612,I ordered size large as I am between size small to medium.,85612,4
85612,It fits me perfect and the length is not short for 5.6 hight (without high heel).,85612,4
85612,I would have given 5 star if the inside fabric was cotton.,85612,4
85612,The inside fabric makes you a bit sweaty  during summer.,85612,4
85612,Overall;  the dress is classy and you can wear it as evening gown or casual depends on your jewelries.,85612,4
85614,Glad covered the phone well.,85614,4
85614,The color was slightly off.,85614,4
85614,The glad slightly impacted the touch navigation in the screen.,85614,4
85615,Wanted a swimsuit that had bust support.,85615,4
85615,"But not a swimsuit  that had a skirt, they do not flatter plus size girls.",85615,4
85615,This one works well.,85615,4
85615,The shoulder straps are comfortable.,85615,4
85615,Did not stretch out  while in water.,85615,4
85615,( support still there).,85615,4
85615,I would buys his brand  again.,85615,4
85616,I really like this shirt.. Its smaller than a US large but it fits me perfect.,85616,4
85616,I am 5'7 and 115.,85616,4
85616,Its light weight and looks exactly like the picture.,85616,4
85616,Its great for work and with leggings because it covers your back end.,85616,4
85617,A little tighter than I expected,85617,4
85618,My son in law loved this as a gift!,85618,4
85619,"Good basic skirt, but I have others that are more flattering.",85619,4
85620,These are good tops for the price they are listed at.,85620,4
85620,They are on the cheaper side; price and material.,85620,4
85620,"If you're familiar with H&M/Forever 21, they are along those lines of quality.",85620,4
85620,"Pros: Comfy, Affordable, easy asses to nurse
Cons: No washing info in English, shrink a good amount in dryer.",85620,4
85620,"Also note:

-There is a tag, card stock thickness, seen into the OUTSIDE FRONT of the top.",85620,4
85620,You will need to cut the thread to remove it.,85620,4
85620,It has a separate thread sewn to it.,85620,4
85622,I put it on and busted out the elastic on the back.,85622,4
85622,I'm only a 34C and not that thick around the top!,85622,4
85622,My mom is currently tacking the elastic back in,85622,4
85623,The top was tricky,85623,4
85624,Overall happy with the finished product.,85624,4
85624,My  complaint(s) is I wished the necklace was better quality and a more secure clasp was added.,85624,4
85625,Almost to nice to wear.,85625,4
85626,"It was very sheer, so you may want to get a tank top to wear underneath it.",85626,4
85626,"Otherwise, I have no complaints.",85626,4
85627,Chain could be a tad longer and thicker.,85627,4
85627,Overall pretty good purchase.,85627,4
85628,Love this bag and get a ton of comments about how cute it is!,85628,4
85628,"Only drawback is there are is no separation or compartments- if u put too much in I t, then ur fishing for things-  But I totally love it anyway!",85628,4
85629,"Good quality, although the post on one pin was bent.",85629,4
85630,Very light weight and the color is perfect for my pink obsessed self.,85630,4
85630,Only con is my handle seems to get stuck when I try to put it down.,85630,4
85630,Just to have fidget with it a bit to fix that.,85630,4
85630,Other than that perfect for airport weight standards!,85630,4
85631,Not the blouse that I initially ordered but like the bold colors.,85631,4
85632,The shoes fit great and are exactly what I was looking for.,85632,4
85632,They are trendy and go with so many different outifits.,85632,4
85632,The tan is a little lighter than pictured.,85632,4
85632,My only negative comment is: the buckles on the side move around and don't serve much of a purpose.,85632,4
85632,They are cheaply placed on the leather.,85632,4
85633,The blouse looks as expected and is of nice quality but it is somewhat smaller than the size expected to be so I would go one size up from your actual size to ensure a good fit.,85633,4
85634,"This swim suit is nice,  but honestly it should be called a by the water suite.",85634,4
85634,There is honestly no way I would feel secure in playing around or swimming in this outfit as it offers very little support for my breast.,85634,4
85634,"Don't get me wrong,  I will be wearing it,  because I look fabulous in it.",85634,4
85634,I purchased an XL and I'm 5'6.5 195lbs if that helps.,85634,4
85634,"I really love the look of the outfit it looks like the picture, but the top just doesn't offer the support.",85634,4
85635,Love the price and looks.,85635,4
85635,Workmanship looks good - have only used 2 times so far.,85635,4
85635,I usually order up a half size for the right fit.,85635,4
85635,Did that for these but they were way too big.,85635,4
85635,Ordered my daughter's sneaker size and they are perfect.,85635,4
85638,Beautiful dress but runs small.,85638,4
85638,I'd order a size bigger.,85638,4
85638,Which is why I gave it 4 stars.,85638,4
85640,"I read many reviews before purchasing this item, as well as viewing other vendors' products first... Usually, I am a medium across the board or a small if the sizes run bigger.",85640,4
85640,My only option was to purchase a Large in this product.,85640,4
85640,"I was anticipating it to fit either slightly loose or perfect, judging from reviews that said to buy a size up.",85640,4
85640,"When I first opened the package, the suit looked pretty big just holding it up.",85640,4
85640,"However, once I actually tried it on, it does fit slightly snug.",85640,4
85640,The issue is more so that the suit doesn't seem to be long enough to stretch the length of my torso - which is a rather small length.,85640,4
85640,"It tends to be tight on my shoulders; the material doesn't give much room to stretch and the shoulder straps are also positioned weird, but it looks exactly as I expected, so I have no complaints.",85640,4
85640,"I can stand up straight and be 95% comfortable walking around in it, but I do definitely advise buying a size larger than what you would generally wear.",85640,4
85640,Hope this review helps!,85640,4
85641,"Fit is good around legs, and material a little too thin and flimsy, seems like it would snag easily and tear while crawling around.",85641,4
85642,Beautiful and unique piece of jewelry.,85642,4
85643,"This is an excellent bracelet, that is very adjustable and will fit smaller woman wrists.",85643,4
85643,"The beads look genuine and if not real, but I had a chip on one of mine, so it was it a bit disappointed that it wasn't checked for quality control.",85643,4
85643,Otherwise I had no complaints.,85643,4
85644,My students think they are comfortable.,85644,4
85644,A bit long in length and will need to be hemmed.,85644,4
85644,So sad the customer service was so poor from the company.,85644,4
85644,The product is great but I would never order from this company again.,85644,4
85645,"This top is adorable, but if you have a bigger chest, order 2 or more sizes up.",85645,4
85645,I ordered a 3xl because I'm a 38 DD and it fit perfect.,85645,4
85645,"Looks good with jean shorts or a denim skirt, perfect for a country concert.",85645,4
85646,"Love the shirt, but it is SO small.",85646,4
85646,I am normally a medium or small.,85646,4
85646,The medium is more like an XXS.,85646,4
85646,Going to order again in a larger side.,85646,4
85647,"Because the shirt is clear, the thin material becomes so transparent.",85647,4
85647,I'm lucky as I'm not hairy which makes thin-fabric shirts disgusting!,85647,4
85648,"sexy, nice pocket for my package, others seem to like the look as well.",85648,4
85649,"I like this dress, fit is as expected.",85649,4
85649,It's not the best quality dress but it's a great price for a flattering work dress.,85649,4
85650,"They are smaller than I thought, but I still like them.",85650,4
85651,"I got it at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but it was only for a certain size.",85651,4
85651,"I thought it might be a little small, and I was right, it wouldn't zip.",85651,4
85651,But I'm in the process of exchanging it now (even though I have to pay a little more! ),85651,4
85651,and I am SO hopeful that it fits!,85651,4
85651,"This dress arrived very quickly, it is a very sturdy material, and I love the length!",85651,4
85651,It's very flattering even on a bigger girl like me.,85651,4
85651,"It may be a tiny bit smaller than expected, but only just.",85651,4
85651,This is a great dress to have in your closet!,85651,4
85652,Fits large for a medium but it's wearable,85652,4
85653,"I bought 2 of these this past Christmas for my boyfriend and I. I was looking for a funny/ugly Christmas sweater as a gag gift, but when I saw this I wanted one, too!",85653,4
85653,"It fits as expected, and will definitely keep you warm.",85653,4
85653,"I haven't been able to wear it as much as I would like to, only because I live in Texas and would be sweating a lot with this on.",85653,4
85653,We get comments about our sweaters whenever somebody sees them.,85653,4
85654,I purchased this bracelet for my bodybuilding competition.,85654,4
85654,"It looked great on stage, was comfortable and easy to put on and remove.",85654,4
85655,I like the look (very smooth leather) and the size is perfect.,85655,4
85655,The one thing I would have preferred would be an outside zipper  or clip to hold it all closed.,85655,4
85655,"I filled pretty much every slot inside (yeah, it all fit!)",85655,4
85655,but it's a little sloppy when it flops open.,85655,4
85655,"Still, a small issue considering everything else is perfect.",85655,4
85655,It was surprisingly difficult to find a small compact wallet with all the details I wanted.,85655,4
85655,It has a place for my driver's license so I can just flip it open to show (most wallets now you have to dig it out) and a few slots for photos which is nice.,85655,4
85655,Easy to reach the most often used credit cards.,85655,4
85656,"I thought I had lost my onyx earrings, so I ordered these.",85656,4
85656,"Wouldn't you know, but I found them.",85656,4
85656,"Still, I liked the shape of these, so I kept them.",85656,4
85656,They do have a very nice sparkle to them.,85656,4
85656,"Black is my favorite ""color"" so I can wear these earrings to dress up/dress down the outfits.",85656,4
85656,"I also like the elliptical shape, rather than a more conventional round onyx.",85656,4
85656,"One thing I wish: since the studs slide into a jacket, there isn't much of a stem on the back that comes through.",85656,4
85656,"I wish the stem were just a hair longer, because it worries me that the backing could fall off and I'd lose the earring.",85656,4
85656,"For that reason, I gave it a 4 instead of a 5.",85656,4
85657,"I love this bag, it's just the right size.",85657,4
85658,Fast shipping exactly what i was looking for,85658,4
85659,"I wish it would come in a small size, all in all it's a great purduct",85659,4
85661,This looks Great on!!!,85661,4
85662,super cute on my teenage daughter.,85662,4
85662,Fit her well and is not too thin or see thru.,85662,4
85663,It's just that it keeps coming off even if its secured tightly.,85663,4
85665,I am a small and they sent me a large but the fit is comfortable.,85665,4
85665,I would advise ordering larger then you need.,85665,4
85667,"Fit a little small, but it was basically fine.",85667,4
85667,The colors are really nice.,85667,4
85667,"The white parts (including the top) were translucent when wet, but I think I can get some cups to put in there.",85667,4
85668,It does seem to run a little small.,85668,4
85668,"I ordered the large too just to see the size difference, I'll probably update once it comes in.",85668,4
85668,"I'm 5'2, 112, larger through the chest, and the S fits ok just a little snug around the arms/shoulders.",85668,4
85668,"The length hits right at the top of my hips, which is perfect.",85668,4
85668,"The back is quite low; I can wear a regular bra, but it takes some wiggling and maybe some fabric tape.",85668,4
85668,"It seems well made enough for the price; it's not a high end piece, but it's not a high end price, either.",85668,4
85668,"It's a really flattering little shirt, and a nice balance of sexy and covered up; this wouldn't work with a too-low neckline.",85668,4
85668,"The edges are raw and the button that holds the back together isn't exactly solidly attached (nothing a few stitches can't fix), but again, at this price point, that's to be expected.",85668,4
85668,"The arms are cut slim, and the back does flip open quite a bit.",85668,4
85668,"I plan on wearing a very minimal black bra underneath and think it'll be fine, but if you're comfortable braless, that's probably the way to go.",85668,4
85668,"Edit to update: I bought the large as well, and it fit MUCH better than the small.",85668,4
85668,"I didn't see a huge size difference between the two, honestly, the large just gave me enough room to move without feeling like I was going to hulk out of the shirt.",85668,4
85668,"I think the medium would've been perfect, as the large was maybe a wee touch loose, but the medium wasn't Prime at the time and I needed it quickly.",85668,4
85668,"I returned the small, kept the large, and wore it out this weekend to rave reviews.",85668,4
85669,They are nice but just a little small,85669,4
85670,"Very pretty ring, I bought it to wear in a cartilage piercing, and honestly it's not a good choice for that specifically.",85670,4
85670,"At least for me, the post is too short to get all the way through the cartilage and be able to clasp it shut on the other side, and it's honestly a little big for a cartilage piercing for my taste.",85670,4
85670,"But it seems to be good quality, and for another application like a nose piercing or maybe eyebrow, it would work really well.",85670,4
85671,"I thought it would be tighter, but it is very comfortable and I like it.",85671,4
85672,Nice tote bag !,85672,4
85672,Big and didn't look cheap at all well made .,85672,4
85673,"Ordered a large, usually wear medium.",85673,4
85673,"Very light weight, need to be ladylike when wearing!",85673,4
85674,"It's comfy, fits well and my purchase arrived sooner than expected.",85674,4
85675,It was not easy to iron.,85675,4
85676,I could not tell you if it is that the size is good because they are gifts for nothingness but at first sight it seems that it is fair,85676,4
85678,It fits everywhere i just wish there was more support in the bust area.,85678,4
85680,The hat is really cute.,85680,4
85680,"It fits a little large on me, but it's ""doable"".",85680,4
85680,I can still wear it and it looks fine.,85680,4
85681,I'm a 5'4 weighing 123 lbs.,85681,4
85681,Medium is very little bit loose on me so Small would be a perfect fit.,85681,4
85681,I wore this for an opera watch in NYC.,85681,4
85681,It was my very first time to visit New York and I never received so much compliment wearing this dress feeling very welcomed.,85681,4
85681,This dress can be worn back and front ways depending how much you want to show your breast I guess.,85681,4
85681,"If you want this covered then wear it on U neck, if you want it sexy then wear it V neck, this sequined dress is not that comfortable but will definitely make you look modernly preppy or a rich lady from the old Hollywood style.",85681,4
85683,God look for the price.,85683,4
85684,I like it... it's light and soft.,85684,4
85686,This is an adorable little outfit for my little guy.,85686,4
85686,"When it first arrived, I thought that it looked a little small, however I measured it against other clothes that I recently purchased for him that are also a size 4t.",85686,4
85686,"As a result, I am confident that the size is just fine, although the shirt looks a little short, but that may be because my little guy is very tall and has a long torso.",85686,4
85686,But it is only a very little bit shorter than the 4t shirt that I purchased in another brand.,85686,4
85686,The outfit looks just as it is pictured.,85686,4
85686,Both the pants and top appear to be well made.,85686,4
85686,I have no complaints.,85686,4
85686,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.,85686,4
85687,"That is, the medium size fits me as a normal medium.",85687,4
85687,I like the covered buttons.,85687,4
85687,An entirely satisfactory product.,85687,4
85688,"wow super cute, I got them in mail yesterday and wore them to work today and wow they are comfy.",85688,4
85688,love them and plan to buy more in different color.,85688,4
85688,disclaimer I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion be it good or bad.,85688,4
85689,I does it's job.,85689,4
85690,"I like it ,it's pretty",85690,4
85693,it was a little small,85693,4
85694,Really cute shirt and fits perfectly.,85694,4
85694,"The fabric is slightly less soft/nice looking after a wash or two, but I still love the unique design so much.",85694,4
85695,These work great for keeping my favorite pins in place.,85695,4
85696,I HAVEN;T WOREN THESE CUTE SOCKS YET HAVE MISS LAID THEM WILL WEAR THEM WHEN I FIND THEM THEY ARE SO CUTE I LOVE THEM,85696,4
85697,"thin, tight fit, but cute",85697,4
85698,It only took about a week for it to arrive and it was well packaged.,85698,4
85698,It is made of a durable material and the color was true to the picture.,85698,4
85698,"The top is somewhat adjustable but none of the straps are sewn in so be careful not to pull them out of the clasps when adjusting, it wouldn't take much to sew them in place once you have it on comfortably.",85698,4
85698,The cups in the top are a firm thick padding and the bottoms  are sewn together well.,85698,4
85698,As for sizing...I am 5 ft 4in and roughly 120 lbs I have an athletic (boyish) not so curvy build and I am a 34 b cup.,85698,4
85698,I am normally a 3/4 in U.S sizes and I ordered a medium.,85698,4
85698,The top is just a little big not so much that it looks funny but I probably would have done better with a small.,85698,4
85698,"The bottoms I recieved were made for someone built like a Kardashian, if you have a booty they would likely fit fine but I had to make some adjustments to get them to fit (and they cover my butt completely), again I might have done better with a smaller size but I am not at all unhappy with the purchase I will likely be ordering another in a smaller size for comparison.",85698,4
85698,The pictures ive included are AFTER the adjustments were made to the bottoms.,85698,4
85699,"Very nice, bit of stretch to it.",85699,4
85700,I bought them for my lady she say that fit just rite and comfortable they size was perfect,85700,4
85701,"Simple construction, but comfortable for the growing bump.",85701,4
85702,"Little large, luckily it does hang beautifully.",85702,4
85703,i really like them but sometimes i have a hard time reading digital screens.,85703,4
85704,I loved the colors of the product and it feels like a good quality.,85704,4
85704,We ordered medium for my 7 month old daughter who was at 22 percentile for weight and 85% for length at her 6 month appointment.,85704,4
85704,So she is long and lean.,85704,4
85704,"It was just the right size for her but probably in 2 weeks, she would outgrow it.",85704,4
85704,So we returned and ordered large.,85704,4
85704,Will update the review when the new one arrives,85704,4
85705,I really like it and have received a lot of compliments.,85705,4
85706,Material a little thin wrinkles a bit.,85706,4
85706,I am not a fan of the collar very big turtleneck you have roll it twice.,85706,4
85706,I do like it overall.,85706,4
85706,I was not buying it for warmth I wanted it for dressing up jeans and white leggings.,85706,4
85706,I like that you can wear it sideways making it shorter and neater.,85706,4
85706,For the price you can't beat it.,85706,4
85706,I would give it four stars if the collar were smaller and if the material did not wrinkle in suitcase.,85706,4
85706,I recommend  it and the company.,85706,4
85707,Everything was as expected except the shirt was extra wide around the torso.,85707,4
85707,Neck and sleeves fit well.,85707,4
85707,I am medium build but has room for a lot larger person.,85707,4
85707,It will do for my needs though.,85707,4
85708,"Pretty good quality for the money, though flannel is on the thin side.",85708,4
85708,"Sleeve are a little on the short side, but OK.",85708,4
85708,Very nice colors and style.,85708,4
85709,These are pricey in my opinion.,85709,4
85709,"However, the look and quality are very nice.",85709,4
85710,"Great bathing suit, sslighty awkward fit, but doable.",85710,4
85711,"First of all, this diaper is adorable!",85711,4
85711,"It fit my small 5 month old and I'm sure it's the right size, but it did leave marks on her chubby little thighs.",85711,4
85711,"She didn't poop while wearing it, so I can't comment on its ability to hold poop.",85711,4
85711,"I like the idea of reusable diapers, but I didn't like the red legs.",85711,4
85711,Disposable swim diapers don't leave those marks.,85711,4
85711,"Overall, I recommend this diaper.",85711,4
85712,Quality fabric and durable.,85712,4
85712,Order a size up though.,85712,4
85712,"Coming from China, they fit a bit tight in the waist",85712,4
85713,I received my wallet.,85713,4
85713,Very pretty and very nice.,85713,4
85713,A bit smaller than I expected but I think it will work out nicely.,85713,4
85713,I hope it protects my card from getting demagnetized.,85713,4
85713,The mount that I have in my vehicle comes with a magnet that mounts on my phone case and sticks to the round metal ball mounted in my truck.,85713,4
85713,This magnet on my phone keeps stripping my  credit card.,85713,4
85713,Hope this does the trick.,85713,4
85714,"Very comfortable, hides my tummy, looks very pretty, I am not embarrassed of my self in this.",85714,4
85715,The size was a very small though.,85715,4
85715,I bought size 2T and it  fit like an 18 month outfit.,85715,4
85716,Love the style and great quality but the size runs small.,85716,4
85716,I ordered a size up in hopes they might fit next year too.,85716,4
85716,But they fit perfect this year.,85716,4
85717,"Cute, flowy and thin.",85717,4
85717,The lace top part lies a bit weird and it's easily wrinkled but I still love the dress.,85717,4
85717,Definitely would get a smaller size than the chart given so I'll just wear it with a belt.,85717,4
85718,Nice look but a little thin.,85718,4
85719,The skirt is beautiful!,85719,4
85719,It is exactly what I expected but it is cut a little small.,85719,4
85720,"This is a small bag, I kept it because it KINDA looks like the original  Celine bags, the smell goes away, and if you add a furry keychain it completes it..",85720,4
85722,I bought the 8125 (blue and yellow) set.,85722,4
85722,It's very pretty and seems to be well made.,85722,4
85722,"Unfortunately the earrings don't contain the blue and yellow stones which I would have preferred, but still very nice.",85722,4
85722,I also like that the earrings are not very heavy so I imagine it's going to be comfortable wearing them all day.,85722,4
85723,"Pretty nice , for the price",85723,4
85724,"I was confused by the sizing, and ended up buying two that were too big.",85724,4
85724,I think a size small was size 6.,85724,4
85726,they rip easily but other than that i love them enough i bought them twice,85726,4
85729,Although soft this shirt is VERY SEE THROUGH!,85729,4
85730,"Overall well made, a little bit short to fit my electric toothbrush, but still works.",85730,4
85731,The fabric is thicker and nicer than I anticipated and it is super cute but the size is a little too small for me.,85731,4
85731,"It has really has no stretch so that doesn't help me, but overall I really like it",85731,4
85734,Have several pairs because the pocket design is what I want.,85734,4
85734,"Wear a little easy, but maybe I'm a little hard on them.",85734,4
85737,"Great bag, was bought as a gift and receiver of said gift loved the color and size, can fit her water bottle which is important when buying bags.",85737,4
85738,"was hoping for more red, but it's a pretty little thing!",85738,4
85740,Dress fit ok accept it too thin on the bottom (black and white).,85740,4
85741,"I didn't pay too much for this so I'm not going to be too harsh,  but the underwear inside was pretty big.",85741,4
85741,Far too big for my girlfriend.,85741,4
85741,The rest of the outfit was pretty cool :),85741,4
85743,"I got a small and the top was a little too large, which is normal for me when buying swimwear.",85743,4
85743,"The material is a very high quality, but deifnitely worth what you pay, and the shorts fit great what you pay.",85743,4
85743,Top is pretty much just a sports bra,85743,4
85745,I love this bag!!,85745,4
85745,The color stands out and I love the texture.,85745,4
85746,"Wish it came in a ""Tall"" fit
(3XLT instead of just 3XL)

But, it's hard to find band Tees larger than 2x to begin with, so I guess I can't really complain too much",85746,4
85747,I really like this hat.,85747,4
85747,It fits well and looks nice on.,85747,4
85747,He cost is reasonable and the product is nice.,85747,4
85748,My grand daughter liked it,85748,4
85749,Loved everything about it except the material,85749,4
85750,Fits easy doesn't ride up especially due to wide hips,85750,4
85752,Recommended by my podiatrist.,85752,4
85752,Time will tell if they provide any relief.,85752,4
85753,This hat is wonderful and warm.,85753,4
85753,The fit is a little big- I wear a Hoodie with mine.,85753,4
85753,The satin lining on the hood makes it slide around a bit.,85753,4
85754,"This is very pretty, it fits true to size everywhere except breast area.",85754,4
85754,I ordered the xxl and I am a c/d cup and I hang out all over!,85754,4
85754,It still looks sexy on so I am going to keep it but can't wear it out of the bedroom!,85754,4
85755,It could have been better but not to bad daughter like it,85755,4
85756,bought for my daughter who is tall and slender (typically wears a small or medium).,85756,4
85756,"it's a bit baggie on her and she has to wear a tight tank underneath to prevent her undergarments from showing thru the arm holes, but it looks cute and she loves it",85756,4
85757,"Love the fit, colors and thick, stretchy material.",85757,4
85758,I do like these shoes as I do stand on my feet all day long.,85758,4
85758,I usually where a size 9 in skechers shoes.,85758,4
85758,I wish I would have ordered a size 9.5.,85758,4
85758,I found that they are a little tight in the toe area.,85758,4
85758,I have worn them a week now and they are slowly stretching out.,85758,4
85758,But by midafternoon my toes do hurt a little.,85758,4
85758,But the soft and comfy foot padding is really nice.,85758,4
85758,I know in another week they will be perfect.,85758,4
85758,I will deal with it.,85758,4
85758,Because I can't not where the 30 shoes you buy in the big box stores anymore.,85758,4
85758,My feet kill me with those on.,85758,4
85758,I will definitely order these again when I need new one's but in a half size bigger.,85758,4
85759,I'm 119 lbs and a 36C and it fit pretty well other than the middle was a little tight but that's mostly because I've had a child and have a little extra chub in the front.,85759,4
85759,But overall it fits and looks pretty good.,85759,4
85760,amazing quality they don't rust and everything rusts on me,85760,4
85761,"I ordered the size based on the chart, but it's too big.",85761,4
85761,"I'm sure he'll grow into it over the summer, so it's better than being too small.",85761,4
85762,I read the comments about it running small and ordered a size up.,85762,4
85762,Now it's 2 sizes too big.,85762,4
85762,Shame too because I like it.,85762,4
85762,I'm gonna see if I can get it altered because it's too much hassle to return it.,85762,4
85762,"It's good material, it's even a little stretchy so order your normal size.",85762,4
85762,The quality is better than i expected however the belt that came with it looks cheap.,85762,4
85762,I thought I would just use a different belt but the dress has belt loops so you would need a thin belt similar to what comes with it and I don't have one.,85762,4
85762,"Also the belt doesn't sit on my waist, it's directly under my bust instead so my waist belts don't stay there.",85762,4
85762,Looks like I'll have to invest in a thin waist belt and an alteration.,85762,4
85763,Fits well...quality is medium ( a little thin) but the design and fit are worth it.,85763,4
85763,"I bought it for the saying on the front, so it's good enough.",85763,4
85764,"Great wallet, it's a little larger than the old original style but works the same.",85764,4
85765,I expected the material to br a bit thicker,85765,4
85766,"Lined, so it'll be really warm for the winter.",85766,4
85766,"Looks  cute, just can't  wear it quite yet.",85766,4
85767,"It,s nice that it has a draw string to adjust the size, very clever.",85767,4
85768,Picture is much more sharper than actual item,85768,4
85769,"I Ordered a 22w at first which I knew I shouldn't have gotten , but reviews said if you had a bigger bust size up.",85769,4
85769,Which I did but was wayyyy to big.,85769,4
85769,So then I sent it back.,85769,4
85769,And ordered a size smaller .,85769,4
85769,but instead they sent me 2 sizes smaller which was actually perfect.,85769,4
85769,"BUY THE DRESS its beautiful , I ordered the blue and gold one .",85769,4
85769,The whole process was quick.,85769,4
85769,The material of the dress is every elegant and beautiful .,85769,4
85769,The refund process was quick also.,85769,4
85769,If help is needed customer service responds great with email ( within some hours ).,85769,4
85769,The only dislike is my dress had minor stitching problems near the zipper which will be easy to fix.,85769,4
85769,"I plan on wearing this dress to prom in April, might post pictures.",85769,4
85769,I Would recommend to follow the sizing chart.,85769,4
85769,Also the material has stretch which is always good for a plus size girl.,85769,4
85769,Get the dress !,85769,4
85770,"The shirt is so cute, and it looks exactly like the photo.",85770,4
85770,"The material is soft and high quality, and you probably don't need to wear an undershirt.",85770,4
85770,The style is loose - I got the 4US size and it's slightly larger than a normal size 4 in US in my opinion.,85770,4
85771,My son loves these sneakers,85771,4
85772,A bit smaller than I expected...,85772,4
85773,"Im 5""0 pants/115 pounds- fit me perfect!!!",85773,4
85773,"Kind of lose a little bit in tummy area-its silky,semi thin,but not to the point wear its too see through,cute with a long top",85773,4
85774,Pretty top just too small.,85774,4
85774,So i got one.,85774,4
85774,Fit everywhere but getting in it was a pain and it was kinda shorter than I expected.,85774,4
85774,Its also a silky material.,85774,4
85774,Cute but just not for me.,85774,4
85775,was a good hat but just smelt funny when received.,85775,4
85776,Very cute bathing suit.,85776,4
85778,Fit a bit small,85778,4
85779,Great look...too big...order one size smaller,85779,4
85780,great item worked as stated and promt delievery,85780,4
85781,The sleeves are a tad bit short.,85781,4
85782,Great for travel and layering!,85782,4
85784,Bought this for my wife; she says it's not a slim fit jacket.,85784,4
85784,It's more big and boxy and the arms are short for the size.,85784,4
85784,It would be good for a short big build woman with short arms.,85784,4
85785,It's not a terrible suit for the price.,85785,4
85786,This coat is much better than I expected.,85786,4
85786,"It is very warm, with plenty of features and options.",85786,4
85786,For instance the fur is detachable as is the hood.,85786,4
85786,The waist is adjustable on the inside for a tighter fit.,85786,4
85786,It has buttons and a 2-way zipper for closing the coat.,85786,4
85786,The inner collar lining is also detachable!,85786,4
85786,Overall it handles rain and wind well.,85786,4
85786,The coldest temperature I've worn it in was about 25 degrees Fahrenheit with a strong wind and I remained perfectly warm.,85786,4
85786,What more could you ask for?,85786,4
85786,I also own a $300+ Eddie Bauer all weather coat and I really couldn't point out a substantial difference in performance.,85786,4
85786,The bottom line is this is a nice coat.,85786,4
85787,This skirt is a great deal for the price.,85787,4
85787,"After reading a lot of reviews, I knew to expect that the bottoms edge would not be hemmed and it might be kind of short.",85787,4
85787,"Luckily, I didn't think it was too short, and because of the fabric it is made from, the unhemmed edge doesn't matter.",85787,4
85787,It arrived about a week before the first date in the range I was given.,85787,4
85787,"When I finally wore it today, I got a ton of compliments on the Starry Night pattern that I chose.",85787,4
85787,"My two complaints are that the fabric is shinier than I would prefer and the elastic in the back was only sewn in on the ends, not the middle.",85787,4
85787,"However, a couple quick stitches in the back fixed that.",85787,4
85787,"Overall, this is a great skirt in an adorable pattern.",85787,4
85788,Gifted and worn to keep her toes warm.,85788,4
85789,Good fit over my wide glasses.,85789,4
85790,Nicely plant crafted piece of jewelry but should have come with a chain,85790,4
85791,"Love this hoodie, very warm!",85791,4
85792,My reason for the four star is the fit is tricky.,85792,4
85792,"I bought these bigger when I was bigger, and now that I have lost weight I knew what I wanted for fit.",85792,4
85792,"This time I ordered a large, and now I would be considered a size 10.",85792,4
85792,"This is a good choice for me, a middle-aged tall woman with slender hips.",85792,4
85792,I wear these with a variety of tankini tops.,85792,4
85792,I especially like the fact there is no seam down the middle front for a modest fit.,85792,4
85793,Really cute shirt but big for a 2T,85793,4
85795,Long wait but no other complaints,85795,4
85796,Can't wait to wear it to the beach.,85796,4
85798,It's not very long and I'm 5'3 118lb so I'd say it fit well but not length wise,85798,4
85799,"They fit well, but I find them too thin and they seem to thin a bit more with washing.",85799,4
85799,Definitely not a footsie for winter time (when my son was born...),85799,4
85800,These are great and will be purchased in the next size once needed.,85800,4
85800,They fit the baby well and are adorable.,85800,4
85801,Super cute and loved the color.,85801,4
85801,Just a little short and doesn't have much shape.,85801,4
85801,I would probably wear this to bed.,85801,4
85801,Also has a wider neck line and I was hoping for a crew or scoop neck.,85801,4
85802,"This is definitely super cheap, feels like plastic, but it is also very pretty.",85802,4
85802,"I get lots of compliments on it and for the $2 I paid, I'm not upset about the quality.",85802,4
85803,I removed the metal buckle which easily bends and replaced it with my superior Eagle Creek buckle.,85803,4
85805,I literally purchased 10 swimsuits from Tankini's to one pieces trying to find one that fits my chest area without major spillage or having the underwire lay right on top of the boob.,85805,4
85805,I am 5'0 about 167 pounds and I have 38DD chest size (They are not a perky 38DD!),85805,4
85805,This fit my body top like a glove!,85805,4
85805,I ordered two sizes in the pink floral the 50 (16-18) and the 52 (18-20) and both fit but the 16-18 fit the best.,85805,4
85805,I think if you are taller than 5'5 this may not work for you.,85805,4
85805,Like other reviewers said if you have a larger chest the cups are ridiculous but you can easily take them out.,85805,4
85805,The material and the fabric are well constructed for the price.,85805,4
85805,I am taking this swimsuit to Hawaii and I wanted something that was stylish but also something I could be active be in without worrying about falling out all over the place.,85805,4
85805,Happy I found this in time!,85805,4
85806,this bag is magnificent!!,85806,4
85806,It am a big designer bag lover and this bag did not only NOT disappoint but it exceeded my expectations!!,85806,4
85806,It was navy and metallic and had a removable organizer insert!!,85806,4
85806,It never buy a bag smaller than 15 inches long and this was a perfect fit!,85806,4
85806,I would have given it 5 stars but I was disappointed that it is not on prime anymore and I really wanted to buy few more colors!,85806,4
85807,For as cost effective as this was it is so cute.,85807,4
85809,The only problem I have is I would love it to be longer.,85809,4
85809,I'm 5'11  and it falls at my ankles.,85809,4
85809,I would have loved it to be longer.,85809,4
85809,Other than that I love it.,85809,4
85810,Weird material and bulky.,85810,4
85810,I'm going to take the padded inserts out.,85810,4
85811,I have bought several earrings from this company and have gotten many compliments on this particular design.,85811,4
85811,"They look delicate yet are made well, I have no concern that they will fall apart.",85811,4
85812,I'd like it better if the 'I heart raves' label wasn't visible on the back of the boxers when flipped.,85812,4
85813,Given as a gift,85813,4
85814,"Daughter loved the colors, and material is shimmery.",85814,4
85814,Great hit with at 10 year old.,85814,4
85815,Sturdy and actually look real good.,85815,4
85815,Can't go wrong with carthartt products.,85815,4
85816,Beautiful and well made suit.,85816,4
85816,"However it
Runs small and unless you have a very short torso.",85816,4
85817,Needed to be altered.,85817,4
85818,Ordered for my mom and it fit her perfect!,85818,4
85819,The straps and back fits nicely; I'm usually a 34-36 band size.,85819,4
85819,The front area is a little small; I usually wear a D or DD.,85819,4
85819,There is slight padding in the front so nipples don't show through.,85819,4
85819,"If you're looking for something with support this might not be the best item, but that also might be due to my size.",85819,4
85819,It still fits decently and I will continue to wear this item.,85819,4
85820,"Great shoes for the price I paid, I just wish the material was a little softer and less stiff.",85820,4
85820,Easy to walk in and comfortable!,85820,4
85821,Good for high arch,85821,4
85822,These are super cute earrings and I can't wait to give them to my daughter for Christmas because she loves Minnie Mouse.,85822,4
85822,"The only complaint I have is for the price I paid, I expected a little bit better quality.",85822,4
85822,"The posts of the earrings came bent, at about a 30-45 degree angle.",85822,4
85822,"I was able to straighten them out a bit, but I worry they might break off.",85822,4
85822,This is something I would expect for cheap earrings from Claire's.,85822,4
85823,I bought a few of these bags and they are good for their price.,85823,4
85823,One of then had a faulty bag strap though...,85823,4
85824,These shorts are well made and are a great fit.,85824,4
85824,"They look like regular shorts that I would wear, but also function great as swim trunks.",85824,4
85824,I tried a lot of different board shorts before I found these!,85824,4
85825,These fit just as I expected.,85825,4
85825,"I am a large normally so I ordered a large, and they are high wasted and they fit snug enough to where the high waist does not slip down.",85825,4
85825,"One thing, between the scales they are as see through as a pair of sheer panty hose.",85825,4
85825,I will order these in another color.,85825,4
85826,I really like Vionic shoes.,85826,4
85826,I have  2 other vionics sandals that are a bit more comfortable than this pair.,85826,4
85826,"I am not saying these shoes aren't comfortable, they are but not as comfortable as the other sandals.",85826,4
85826,The criss-cross straps across the top have rubbed sore spots on the top of my foot simply because there are two straps.,85826,4
85826,I initially felt alot of friction and pressue when I first tried on the sandal and consequently spent a lot of time adjusting the straps.,85826,4
85826,I was afraid I might have to return them if I couldn't get them to stop rubbing along the side of my foot.,85826,4
85826,"Once I wore them for a few hours, I began to feel more positive about them.",85826,4
85826,I really hate to return shoes and I imagine once my foot gets more resilient and accustom to the straps they won't bother me as much.,85826,4
85826,"The color is very versatile, complementing most neutrals, browns, peaches and blues.",85826,4
85826,"The strappy casual style of the sandals can be paired up with shorts, palazzo pants or casual dresses.",85826,4
85827,It is a little more bulky that I thought it would be...It really makes a statement.,85827,4
85828,I would like to see if you have one with a warm lining inside and no elastic on the bottom.,85828,4
85829,Its not exactly like the picture but its still beautiful ans i always get complements with it!,85829,4
85830,If I doubt about size--go bigger,85830,4
85831,I'm 6 foot and a size 32 so it fits goodish.,85831,4
85831,I have a longer back so it rides a bit in the crouch but nothing bad and I wish the hood wash bigger but all in all I'm happy,85831,4
85832,Perfect for long term wear.,85832,4
85832,Vibrant colors as well.,85832,4
85832,The ball can be difficult to screw on but nothing a little determination can't fix.,85832,4
85832,The earring is the one in the lobe.,85832,4
85834,"Great watchband, but a little stiff and kind of cheaply built.",85834,4
85834,The adjustment is wonky and loosens over time.,85834,4
85834,"That said, it was quite affordable, so I'm not disappointed with it.",85834,4
85836,Good size if you don't want to carry very much,85836,4
85838,"Must wear shape wear and a push up bra with this, its not forgiving at all.",85838,4
85838,I sized up a dress size because of the material (I hate clingy dresses but they are so comfortable).,85838,4
85838,plunging neckline but i added a safety pin and worked fine.,85838,4
85839,"Prime  shipping, great price, lovely dress.",85839,4
85839,"It looks like the picture, definitely peach with pink roses.",85839,4
85839,"We ordered size 2 for a 5'1"", 100 pound girl.",85839,4
85839,The fit was pretty good.,85839,4
85839,We needed to take in the shoulders.,85839,4
85839,The corset back is also pulled as tight as it can go.,85839,4
85839,I wish they would offer a size smaller.,85839,4
85839,Also the lining could be a little thicker on the skirt.,85839,4
85839,But for $25 it was an excellent purchase,85839,4
85840,"The dress is quite well made for the price, consistent with other dresses I have purchased from ACEVOG.",85840,4
85840,"For reference, I generally wear an 18 in US sizing; I ordered this in a XXL and it fits just fine (also consistent with other ACEVOG dresses I own).",85840,4
85840,"The print is beautiful (I purchased the ""Rose Red"" version, which has a floral pattern that looks like cherry blossoms along with some lovely colorful birds), the scalloped neckline is a really nice detail, and the material is a mid-weight cotton blend with some stretch to it - it's a nice weight for wearing in the warmer months.",85840,4
85840,"The waistline is higher than it appears in the picture, at least on my dress.",85840,4
85840,"It's more of an empire waist, hitting just below the bust.",85840,4
85840,"This does not bother me, as empire waists are good for hiding a bit of tummy.",85840,4
85840,My only issue is that the bottom hem is not straight across.,85840,4
85840,"As a result, the sides of the dress are significantly and noticeably shorter than the front and back of the dress, on the order of a couple inches.",85840,4
85840,I have not had this issue with an ACEVOG dress before.,85840,4
85840,"(I've actually never had this issue with ANY dress before, and I own an embarrassing number of dresses from a variety of brands.)",85840,4
85840,"I will probably still keep the dress, as it's not something most people will notice at first glance, but it does bother me.",85840,4
85840,"I may try to fix the hem myself, but I'm not much of a seamstress.",85840,4
85840,"Edited to Add: It appears, at least based on the pictures the other reviewers have posted, that there may be an issue with the pattern for this dress - none of them mention it; however, their dresses seem to have the same issue with the front of the skirt being longer than the sides.",85840,4
85840,"(Which is actually the opposite of what you'd expect - normally the fabric would stretch where it was cut on the bias, which is usually at the side seams, not the front and back.)",85840,4
85840,I ended up returning the dress.,85840,4
85840,The discrepancy was too noticeable and really bothered me.,85840,4
85841,great colors love it !,85841,4
85841,Wish they offered tops to go with them.,85841,4
85841,I will have to make a couple myself.,85841,4
85841,Using for mermaid photography session on the Oregon coast.,85841,4
85842,"Good quality, nice fit and holds up after numerous washes.",85842,4
85843,great bra for the price,85843,4
85844,"The beads are much bigger than I expected, but I still love the bracelet, and have been wearing it for a couple weeks now!",85844,4
85846,The color of the fabric is true to the picture.,85846,4
85846,The fabric is of reasonable thickness.,85846,4
85846,The cut of the garment on the shoulder and neck area was a bit awkward.,85846,4
85846,It has a collar around the neck.,85846,4
85846,"The garment came down quite long, even on me (5 foot 11).",85846,4
85846,"If you do not have natural curves, this garment will not help you.",85846,4
85846,"If you are in need of something comfy to lounge around the house or to cover up a nice kami, this is a reasonable choice.",85846,4
85847,"Bottoms are a tad snug and my hips are 38"".",85847,4
85848,"Material is ok, not great.",85848,4
85850,"This is a very Gold, gold.. i think i can darken it a little.",85850,4
85850,but it is cumphy,85850,4
85851,"Looks great,  very playful skirt.",85851,4
85852,"The veil is as described, and my daughter was happy with it for her First Communion.",85852,4
85852,"The style is as shown, but has a more ""bridal"" look to it, as most Communion veils attach at the back of the head.",85852,4
85852,"This one comes attached to a satin wrapped headband, which my daughter happily wore for the duration of the mass and photos before and after.",85852,4
85852,"The shamrocks are glued in place, and didn't fall off for us.",85852,4
85852,I did iron it (tip - cover it with a pillowcase or it will melt!),85852,4
85852,and I think this secured the shamrocks because the glue melted and adhered well between the shamrocks and the veil.,85852,4
85855,Would by it again.,85855,4
85856,Loved the watch...HATE the band.,85856,4
85856,Lasted about a month..maybe...bummer....wouldn't buy watch again  because of that.,85856,4
85857,Feels good...not too tight.,85857,4
85857,"Makes my figure look very nice in bodycon dress, the only thing is I had to wear a thin slip under so you wouldn't seen the outline of the shaper.",85857,4
85858,It fits about half size smaller.,85858,4
85860,"Sometimes you need a purse that will hold just a bit more then a clutch will, but you don't want a huge purse or bag.",85860,4
85860,This is the perfect mix.,85860,4
85860,This woven pattern is a subtle classic style and will look great with whatever outfit you are wearing at the time.,85860,4
85860,"Although small, it's big enough to hold all the necessary essentials.",85860,4
85860,"The inner lining is very nice, the fabric is strong but elegant.",85860,4
85860,There are a few pockets to help organize your items.,85860,4
85860,There is ano adjustable strap so you can wear it on your shoulder or disconnect it to use the wrist strap or place it under your arm.,85860,4
85860,"I love the color, it accessorizes wonderfully.",85860,4
85860,"I do reviews for sellers on Amazon, and usually get a discount for the products that I review, and I did as well, on this item.",85860,4
85860,"However, don't mistake my reviews to be based on discounts.",85860,4
85860,I am 100% honest on what I say about an item I am reviewing.,85860,4
85860,"I read reviews before I purchase an item, I want to know what's good and bad from people that have purchased ahead of me.",85860,4
85860,I stand firmly in my review on this purse.,85860,4
85860,It's a great but.,85860,4
85860,DISCLAIMER:  I received this product discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,85860,4
85861,It's light and flow-y!,85861,4
85861,It's going to be the perfect dress for my 21st birthday I can't wait and the sizing of it is perfect.,85861,4
85862,"I am 5'4"" and 130 lbs.",85862,4
85862,Usually I wear a size small or medium but I ordered the large because I knew that these shirts run small.,85862,4
85862,The pattern of the shirt is really cute.,85862,4
85862,The fabric is light and it is see through so you need to wear a tank top underneath.,85862,4
85862,I'd say it was worth the price paid.,85862,4
85863,"I'm 5'2"" 146lbs natural waist is about 34"" this skirt is a little tight but not horrible.",85863,4
85863,The material is very shiny and it has a built in slip.,85863,4
85864,"5'11"", 160 lb, 42"" chest, 32"" waist, great fit, plenty of length to tuck in...no bunching, nice open v neck, no visibility under unbuttoned dress shirt, works well under fitted shirts",85864,4
85865,"For the price, this is one of the most comfortable thong underwear I've worn.",85865,4
85865,I have a 32 waist and it fits nicely.,85865,4
85865,"But, you know chinese manufacturing standards can be virtually nonexistant in cheap production products so it worked well for me.",85865,4
85865,Just wash in a lingerie wash bag and air dry and it will hold up well.,85865,4
85865,I'll be getting more of these soon.,85865,4
85866,Wish the material was a bit different but still love it,85866,4
85867,It a great jacket for cooler spring or fall.,85867,4
85867,I'm petite but was afraid XS might be too small or tight so I order a small.,85867,4
85867,The length is fine but the width at waist is wider than the tapered look on the product photo.,85867,4
85867,I do like the fact that I can throw it in the washer.,85867,4
85868,I would suggest ordering a size up.,85868,4
85868,Best $4 I spent!,85868,4
85869,Little too small and too short.,85869,4
85869,If it was a little bigger and a little longer it would be perfect!,85869,4
85870,"However, even though it has 2 layers for the dress, it stills can see the bra so I need something to cover it up.",85870,4
85870,"If you have bigger breasts, Get at least one size up.",85870,4
85871,Looking forward to creating dynamic make-up ideas.,85871,4
85872,It was cheep and fits well.,85872,4
85872,Wore in the summer and and kept well through washes.,85872,4
85873,Loved the fit on my full figure.,85873,4
85874,"I was looking for a slimmer wallet than the bi-fold, traditional one I had been using, and this one has worked perfectly so far.",85874,4
85874,"It's definitely slimmer and holds just the essential cards that I need, plus some space for cash.",85874,4
85874,"The only minor complaint is that it scratches easily, if you put it in the same pocket as your keys or phone.",85874,4
85875,Very good quality material but order a size bigger because it does run a little small.,85875,4
85876,My niece just turned 1 months.,85876,4
85876,"Although a bit snug, the cap was beautifully crocheted :) absolutely cute!",85876,4
85877,"The v-cut is slightly off-centered, but it's otherwise a very soft, flattering, very comfortable dress.",85877,4
85877,Best part about it is that it's nearly impossible to wrinkle.,85877,4
85878,"Looks as good as I had hoped, but fits a bit too small.",85878,4
85878,Hard to take off.,85878,4
85879,I just received these bras and am overall happy with them.,85879,4
85879,I am 22 weeks pregnant with my first and wanted to go ahead and get some comfortable bras that I could sleep in and use for nursing later.,85879,4
85879,I have always had larger boobs: 38 DD before pregnancy and quickly grew to a 38 DDD.,85879,4
85879,I got an XL and they fit comfortably with room to grow!,85879,4
85879,I'm able to clasp the band on its shortest setting and even have room to let the cups out when milk comes in.,85879,4
85879,"I took the cup inserts out as they just created a weird shape, but I'll only be using these bras for around the house/sleeping anyways.",85879,4
85879,"I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing these to work, but casual outings with this bra would be fine and comfortable!",85879,4
85879,Unhooking for nursing seems easy enough and secure when it is hooked so I don't have to worry about a boob escaping when I don't want it to.,85879,4
85879,My only complaint is that the shoulder straps roll very easily with barely any movement.,85879,4
85879,I just find it annoying and I have to constantly adjust so that they lay flat.,85879,4
85879,"I'm mostly happy with my purchase, though!",85879,4
85880,I bought two and the first clip broke within a week.,85880,4
85880,But I got a refund on my order so I was okay,85880,4
85881,This is a cute dress.,85881,4
85881,It looks just like the photo... sadly on me it was not flattering... too boxy and too short.,85881,4
85881,I ordered a large and didn't even know there was a zipper until I took it off... maybe a medium would have fit better but it still would have been too short.,85881,4
85882,Beautiful and very good quality.,85882,4
85883,"Shoes r wide, not a great fit for my baby but most babies have wide feet, they r very cute and so soft",85883,4
85884,Lots of great zipper pockets.,85884,4
85884,Fits lots of stuff in it.,85884,4
85884,"But had an odd,strong smell.",85884,4
85884,But I washed it and the smell was then gone.,85884,4
85885,"I love the color and weight of the fabric, but I believe it runs a size small.",85885,4
85885,I ordered up and it still will not button over bust area.,85885,4
85885,I will keep it and wear with a tank under.,85885,4
85886,Nice and exactly what I was looking for.,85886,4
85887,"Bought for a teenager and she loved them, the post was thicker than usual, but they look great!",85887,4
85888,I bought this for my 5-year-old daughter and she seems to find it comfortable.,85888,4
85888,My only real complaint is that it runs a little on the small side.,85888,4
85889,Fit as expected but is a little too short.,85889,4
85890,My boy loves the color and graphic of this sweat shirt.,85890,4
85890,It is still too hot to wear it but he has tried it on and fits nice.,85890,4
85890,Only issue I had is when I washed it for the first time the fuzz from the inside got all over the other clothes in the wash.,85890,4
85890,But the dryer took care of that.,85890,4
85891,It fits a tad small but it's beautiful.,85891,4
85892,"It's a replacement ring for my daughter her first one broke, and she loved it so had to get a new one.",85892,4
85892,Very happy she has it back on.,85892,4
85894,I liked the briefs.,85894,4
85895,Loved the fabric and all the useful pockets.,85895,4
85895,Runs a bit large but I am a petite so maybe that the reason,85895,4
85896,I love the room it allows for a great fit.,85896,4
85896,And the fact that there are 2 dresses and a jacket so I can change.,85896,4
85896,Makes for 4 outfits.,85896,4
85898,"Quite comfortable, and fit as expected.",85898,4
85898,Required more training of the fabric than expected however.,85898,4
85899,Nice suit for the price.,85899,4
85899,Good value all -around.,85899,4
85900,"It looks big when you get it, but once you wash it, it shrinks!",85900,4
85901,"I bought medium waist was perfect for 33"" however length was a little short, should have bought large",85901,4
85902,It was too small for me but I really liked the fast shipment and the product was actually really nice.,85902,4
85903,It's perfect and stylish!,85903,4
85903,Now I just wish I had ordered two!,85903,4
85904,"Cute, runs a bit large.",85904,4
85905,They are a little big on me but overall I like them a lot!!,85905,4
85906,Good against the cold,85906,4
85907,It was not as loose as I like through the stomach and rear.,85907,4
85907,Love the pink color and style.,85907,4
85908,Feels a little on the cheaper side but good considering the price.,85908,4
85909,"My husband and I love them, however you are pretty much paying for the charms, which are the size of a beer cap.",85909,4
85909,All-in-all a very good buy.,85909,4
85909,I did take off one start because for it plus S*H I was expecting something a little more WOW,85909,4
85910,to long for my arm,85910,4
85911,"Fits well, but turns my hands and skin black from the dye.",85911,4
85912,It is cute on but if don't pull the feet up and leave unzipped then looks like a workers outfit lol,85912,4
85913,It's a little too short.,85913,4
85913,But otherwise a nice shirt.,85913,4
85914,"Wearable, but a little too big for my pea nose!",85914,4
85914,I'm pretty sure you can tighten it with some force though.,85914,4
85915,Serviceable every day shirt.,85915,4
85915,Here in the south I think I'd like it better if the blend had a bit more cotton.,85915,4
85916,I bought these hats for my daughter to sleep in.,85916,4
85916,The fabric is nice and soft and they are just as advertised.,85916,4
85916,"The only complaint I have is the size was off, she is 4.5 months and the hats are still a little big on her.",85916,4
85916,I had to fold it up so it wouldn't cover the top half of her face.,85916,4
85917,"Be sure to measure as explained, and you'll have no issues.",85917,4
85917,Too many people seem to go my pant size rather than waist measurement and then complain it doesn't fit.,85917,4
85917,The instructions are there for a reason!!,85917,4
85917,"Anyway... Great fit, love having the pockets and belt loops!",85917,4
85918,Received this with the frame of the glasses damaged.,85918,4
85918,Daughter was unable to wear it.,85918,4
85918,Everything else in the pack worked well in the sand.,85918,4
85918,Had a good time at the beach and my daughter loves playing with the spades and bucket..,85918,4
85919,I'm a huge nautical fan.,85919,4
85919,Infact 2 rooms in my home have a nautical theme.,85919,4
85919,The only thing I didn't like about the bracelet is it fell off my wrist.,85919,4
85919,It was clasped correctly.,85919,4
85919,But it just fell off.,85919,4
85919,Other then that I love the bracelet.,85919,4
85920,The only tricky thing to it was taking the tape off.,85920,4
85920,"Sounds easy, but it doesn't just peel right off.",85920,4
85921,This robe is perfectly lovely.,85921,4
85921,The material is really soft and the design very pretty.,85921,4
85921,"My only complaint is that in the picture, the sleeves are long, and what I received definitely has SHORT sleeves.",85921,4
85921,I was looking forward to long sleeves and I live in a cooler climate.,85921,4
85921,I may ask the seller about this.,85921,4
85921,"Otherwise,  I would recommend and order again myself!",85921,4
85922,"Quality good, colors brilliant, but too wide for my big 4 year old....",85922,4
85922,I may have suspected when ordered it...,85922,4
85922,I will just wait for him to grow into it..,85922,4
85923,Got these for my daughter for camp.,85923,4
85923,She's still there so I'm not sure how they are holding up but they are so cute I had to stretch my bigger foot in them and may have to steal them!!,85923,4
85926,I am givibg 4 stars for the fast shipping and  amazing customer service.,85926,4
85926,Also the dress shape  and the fabric is amazing.,85926,4
85926,"It has some stretch to it, but there is a lining and it has no give in the waist and bust.",85926,4
85926,So unfortunately it does not fit as it should.,85926,4
85926,You should size up.,85926,4
85926,I wear a size 14 - 16.,85926,4
85926,Hopefully I can find a friend that can fit it,85926,4
85927,It is a little smaller than I expected though,85927,4
85928,"These are not that difficult to put on as long as you reach into the shirt, grab the shoulder straps and then put the garment over your head.",85928,4
85928,Your hands will have reserved the spot for your arms to go through.,85928,4
85928,"You might need someone to help you untwist the straps if that is something that happens, though.",85928,4
85928,The fit is really nice.,85928,4
85928,"I am a 40C, 5""2', 200lbs.",85928,4
85928,It's the slightest bit big so I am going to try the 2X.,85928,4
85928,I will keep you posted!,85928,4
85928,":3

Update 07/25/2016:
Dropped a star because the quality control obviously isn't there.",85928,4
85928,One of my tanks arrived with one of the straps sewn to itself.,85928,4
85928,"Unfortunately, I opened it too late to do an exchange so I have to fix it myself.",85928,4
85928,"That's a small frustration, though.",85928,4
85928,"Other than that, they wash well, are made of a soft fabric and look fantastic!",85928,4
85928,The 2X did the job for me.,85928,4
85930,It's really wide...like it fits like a square.,85930,4
85930,"I still like it, because, well, it's Supernatural.",85930,4
85930,But it could fit better.,85930,4
85932,Material is scratchy polyester  not soft cotton like the red one I got last year.,85932,4
85933,It definitely doesn't hang off your back as shown in the picture.,85933,4
85933,Mine is my size but a little snug.,85933,4
85933,"It is not loose, but rather fitted.",85933,4
85934,"Nice, a little heavy",85934,4
85935,Quality of material is a touch off putting.,85935,4
85935,Pics are slightly distorted and unclear.,85935,4
85935,But belt worked for my purpose and was an OK design.,85935,4
85936,ordered a bigger size as suggested still pretty small,85936,4
85938,"Only wish it was 16 inch square, rather than 12 1/2 inches.",85938,4
85939,I love the look an feel of the underware.,85939,4
85939,Just sucks out of the 7 pair one had a small hole in them when I opened the packeag.,85939,4
85939,An one pair was way smaller than the rest.,85939,4
85939,But overall I love them.,85939,4
85942,Good quality  and fit as expected.,85942,4
85944,"The shift is very pretty, however, I'm a pretty tiny person (5'2"" 110pounds, muscular) and it's pretty tight.",85944,4
85945,It was a little small,85945,4
85946,Comfortable during a workout.,85946,4
85948,We bought these for my son he seems to like them very much,85948,4
85949,This tunic hangs really nicely and is slimming.,85949,4
85949,It's also a nice length to wear with leggings (not tights).,85949,4
85950,"Perfect bag for Vegas, big enough for wallet, lip gloss and room key.",85950,4
85951,I wasn't expecting much out of this piece but it was a beautiful complement for my Halloween costume.,85951,4
85951,"The back is a simple chain and I hate wearing things like that because it will turn my skin green, even when wearing it for just an hour.",85951,4
85951,"I ended up taking the chain off and adding black ribbon, then tying it in a bow which looked gorgeous!",85951,4
85952,"Very nice wallet
My only gripe is against me that I didn't look harder
Eventually found it at TJ Maxx for half the price
But nice wallet though",85952,4
85953,"Cute shoe, it runs about a 1/2 size small.",85953,4
85953,"The heel is 2 3/4"" with a 1"" platform so it is like you are wearing 1 3/4"" heels.",85953,4
85953,"I don't know how they will hold up, but for the money, $20.00 well spent.",85953,4
85954,its a beautiful suit.. just fits too small.. gave it to my daughter and she loves it.,85954,4
85955,Its a little loose but it looks really good.,85955,4
85955,Its slightly see through if your ander garments are a dark color.,85955,4
85955,It came a day early.,85955,4
85955,The color was just as expected.,85955,4
85956,I bought this for my wife for a costume party.,85956,4
85956,She normally wears a size medium so I ordered a XL based on other reviews and it's a good thing I did.,85956,4
85956,The XL fits her perfectly.,85956,4
85956,The item is as pictured with the red being made out of a velvet material.,85956,4
85956,"With that in mind, it should be considered that the velvet collects all kinds of different colored ""lints"".",85956,4
85956,Especially white since the white collars do shed a little bit (not enough to be concerned about).,85956,4
85956,"As such, when you plan on wearing it, make sure that you have a lint roller handy.",85956,4
85956,"The inside of the material is not all that comfortable either, so keep that in mind.",85956,4
85956,"It's a great costume though and does look quite sexy, just make sure you order much bigger than you normally would, keep a lint roller handy, and remember to make it comfortable for you too.",85956,4
85957,Grandkids loved wearing these and it helped to protects their faces from the cold.,85957,4
85957,"If I had anything negative to say, it would be that it is not as thick as we expected.",85957,4
85958,"Unsure if they are organic cotton as no labeling can confirm, but daughter loves them.",85958,4
85959,My husband normally wears a XL - size 46 coat.,85959,4
85959,I purchased the XXL after reading some other reviews and it fits a tad roomy.,85959,4
85959,Since the vest can be cinched in back the size worked out fine.,85959,4
85959,The XL would have been a bit snug.,85959,4
85959,For the price the vest and bow tie are well made.,85959,4
85959,Purchased the set in the red paisley and the color matched what was pictured on the site.,85959,4
85960,I bought these charms for my mom and I.,85960,4
85960,They look great on our charm bracelets and have held up well.,85960,4
85960,I have worn mine daily for over 6 months and it is still in great shape and the wording can be read.,85960,4
85960,"The only complaint that I have is that each charm says ""Mother"" on one side and ""Daughter"" on the other.",85960,4
85960,"I would prefer it if each charm said either ""Mother"" OR ""Daughter on both sides.",85960,4
85960,It just seems kind of odd to me.,85960,4
85961,i needed a pair of easy slip ons for the summer that i could commute on the subway in and change out of when I got to work.,85961,4
85961,i don't like wearing sandals on the gross subway (esp in the rain!),85961,4
85961,so these were a great alternative.,85961,4
85961,These aren't the highest quality shoes but they're great for the purpose they serve and the price.,85961,4
85961,I also felt comfortable throwing these on for weekend errands and casual hanging out,85961,4
85963,Just got these pants yesterday and they fit like a dream.,85963,4
85963,"I got the Black XL, I'm 8 months pregnant and before I was pregnant I was a size 12/14.",85963,4
85963,They are so soft and lightweight I love them.,85963,4
85963,"Also, the material is somewhat thin.",85963,4
85963,If you wear black or nude underwear I think you'll be ok.,85963,4
85963,I personally always wear bagger tops or tunics so I'm always covered.,85963,4
85963,"Love it a bunch, will be wearing it after delivery!",85963,4
85965,Wear them separately and together.,85965,4
85965,"Only issue is the black one lost a bit of paint, when taking the tag off.",85965,4
85965,The rings are tagged and wrapped individually.,85965,4
85966,"4/5
Pros:
 Item arrived as shown
 Top fits perfectly despite bows not sitting directly on the nipple (which I preferred)
 Looks incredibly sexy!",85966,4
85966,"Cons:
 Bottom fit too small (I weigh 95-100lbs & this has little room to stretch & my ""lady lips"" we're quite exposed due to thong only covering pretty much just where pubic hairs grow)",85966,4
85968,I ordered a medium because most comments said the shirt was smaller than they expected.,85968,4
85968,My experience is it is bigger than what I would consider a medium.,85968,4
85968,Since it is 100% polyester it is more loose fitting so remember that when buying.,85968,4
85968,"Other than that, the shirt is great.",85968,4
85969,The outfit was adorable but one of the pompoms fell off after only a couple hours,85969,4
85970,The waist of skirt was a little too big,85970,4
85971,I wound up ordering 3 of these... the sizing was off.,85971,4
85971,"I had to get a large, XL, then an XXL in order to accomodate the 36DD.",85971,4
85971,Its a beautiful dress.,85971,4
85971,I'll be selling the smaller ones locally.,85971,4
85972,"Love the material, they are so soft.",85972,4
85972,"They are a little thin, but I wear longer shirts.",85972,4
85973,Exactly what is described.,85973,4
85973,Just to me they run a little big.,85973,4
85974,Fits well and color is as shown in the picture.,85974,4
85974,"It's a nice, thin, and comfortable material.",85974,4
85975,Great product i just order the hoop a little large so it looks funny on my nose.,85975,4
85976,"SIZES ARE LITTLE SMALLER,",85976,4
85977,Loved the outfit but I ordered Brown and received blue instead.,85977,4
85977,Have to shop for blue shoes after already purchasing brown shoes.,85977,4
85978,I received Lots of compliments!,85978,4
85978,"I rated it a 4star, just because it's a little ""puffy"" for my taste.",85978,4
85978,The material and colors are very nice.,85978,4
85978,Very comfortable to wear all day!,85978,4
85979,"Again, leather-look...fit the bill.",85979,4
85979,No complaints at this price point...decent looking.,85979,4
85980,"I love the material, so comfortable!",85980,4
85980,This is one of my favorite brands on here!,85980,4
85980,"However, the only thing is the top part doesn't stay on well, the pocket part seems to make it sag weirdly and I think I need a size smaller I got a medium when I'm usually small.",85980,4
85980,"Other than that, I am in love!",85980,4
85981,"Fits perfectly, really liked it very much.",85981,4
85981,I like it because it's simple not too flashy and not too (nothing on it) kind of beanie.,85981,4
85981,it's just in the middle and feels perfect.. Not a 5 because of the fabric used isn't the best.,85981,4
85982,Loved it for the week I had it.,85982,4
85982,The feather caught on my seat belt and broke right off.,85982,4
85982,Shipping was much faster than quoted.,85982,4
85982,Ordered another one in hopes I won't break this one,85982,4
85983,"I really like this jacket, but it runs much smaller that expected.",85983,4
85983,I have not even been able to wear it yet because I feel like I will barely be able to move around comfortably.,85983,4
85983,Overall all I am looking forward to writing a review after I have actually wore it.,85983,4
85983,"Oh and I got a Medium, but I should have gotten a large maybe even an extra large and I usually wear between a small and medium.",85983,4
85983,I probably will just end up giving it to my little sister.,85983,4
85984,Great top for the price,85984,4
85985,They were soft and felt good to wear around very light.,85985,4
85986,"Have to wear a slip underneath , kinda reveals a little to much below the waist , where the light blue is.",85986,4
85986,"Other then that, looks just like the picture.",85986,4
85988,My boyfriend bought these bracelets for our first valentines day...we are happy!!!,85988,4
85988,Looks nice and they feel good.,85988,4
85988,I LOVE YOU HONEY!,85988,4
85989,LOVE IT  Great Buy!,85989,4
85990,My son in law loves them.,85990,4
85990,He is s kid at heart.,85990,4
85990,Well he is a kid to me.,85990,4
85990,My eldest daughter is his age.,85990,4
85990,I would buy them again as another super hero.,85990,4
85992,"Nice shoes, but a little small.",85992,4
85992,I ordered a half size up and wish I'd' gone up a whole size.,85992,4
85992,Hopefully they will stretch a bit as they break in.,85992,4
85992,"If not, and I order another pair someday, I will go up another half size.",85992,4
85993,We really like the Zutano hats!,85993,4
85993,"The only downside is that they shrink considerably, even if we wash them in the gentle cycle and hang them to dry.",85993,4
85994,Was super excited to show this shirt off at Christmas dinner!,85994,4
85994,"Everyone got a kick out of it, even Grandma.",85994,4
85994,They said next year we should take family photos wearing them.,85994,4
85995,I gave this 4 starts only because the zipper is cheaply made so you have to be very careful with it plus you will also need someone with you to zip it up but other than that I'm 137.2 I ordered a large in the color gray its like a dark/light color and it fit like a glove I really liked the dress.,85995,4
85995,how ever the dress is not strechy and the outside is like a fuzzy material but no bother its still a good dress.,85995,4
85995,I recommend you guys to buy this dress you won't regret it,85995,4
85997,"It is a little large, but cozy and comfortable, a nice medium weight.",85997,4
85998,my only problem with this dress is where the stitching for where the top and bottom are sewn together it makes it difficult to get the zipper up in that spot,85998,4
86000,"Great quality for the price, would be 5 star but material was thinner than expected.",86000,4
86001,"Unfortunately the straps nears the wedge fell apart and the material on the wedge scuffs up and tears pretty bad but other than that, it's a great shoe.",86001,4
86002,"I bought it for my friend, as a gift.",86002,4
86002,My friend likes it!,86002,4
86002,that is all it count to me!,86002,4
86003,I love these shirts.,86003,4
86003,"Order 1 size bigger because they're cut small but other than that, they're great.",86003,4
86003,Super comfy and great price.,86003,4
86004,"The jacket itself, is beautiful, but REALLY runs small.",86004,4
86004,"We had gotten their largest size 2x, and it fit like a large.",86004,4
86004,Company did refund for the jacket.,86004,4
86004,Customer service gets 5 stars.,86004,4
86006,They are a little smaller than other pairs I have ordered.,86006,4
86007,"i like them, but the nose piece is sort of breaking",86007,4
86008,This bracelet is lovely.,86008,4
86008,My only issue is that it has a lobster claw clasp.,86008,4
86008,I would prefer a snap closure on leather bracelets.,86008,4
86008,"But, the quality is good, and it sits well on the wrist.",86008,4
86009,"my wife really likes these rings,",86009,4
86010,Works just like it's supposed to work.,86010,4
86010,If your leather band is tight fitting like it is on many fine watches it may be difficult to get the tool positioned just right.,86010,4
86010,But it can be done.,86010,4
86012,Supposed to be slouchy but the hats are a little big for my head so they are not snug like I like them.,86012,4
86013,My son likes the way these look but the shoe is narrower than he is comfortable with.,86013,4
86013,The bottom sole is visibly narrower than other soccer shoes he has had.,86013,4
86013,"That said, after a few days of ""breaking them in"", he's played a dozen games with no complaint.",86013,4
86014,And I purchased the medium.,86014,4
86014,It's even better looking in person.,86014,4
86015,The tag on the side is the worst it is big and stiff so it makes weird lump on your side.,86015,4
86015,"I removed it and BAM a hole appeared right there after 2 washes, no I do not dry in the dryer.",86015,4
86015,I won't re-order this one but I would by from the company again.,86015,4
86016,"These look great, but they are not comfortable enough for all-day wear.",86016,4
86016,"I wore them to a Halloween party, and to Mardi Gras, but that's it.",86016,4
86019,Bought this to replace the corsage for prom.,86019,4
86019,The girl loved it!,86019,4
86019,Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't come with a display box.,86019,4
86020,"Fun, a little retro, and very light!",86020,4
86021,They don't fit couldn't get them past my thighs.,86021,4
86022,Love the color; fits as advertised; nice shirt.,86022,4
86023,"Kind of large, but okay.",86023,4
86023,Friend likes them anyway.,86023,4
86024,"For reference, I am 5' 5"", 135 pounds, 36B/34C bust.",86024,4
86024,"I'm typically a size small in tops and medium in pants, size 6.",86024,4
86024,"I ordered this bodysuit in the color white, and I am very pleased!",86024,4
86024,"Product came on time, brand new in sealed box.",86024,4
86024,"It fits exactly as pictured, very soft and comfortable and maintains that skin-tight look of a bodysuit without being too see through!",86024,4
86025,Very nice bag but it is a little heavy.,86025,4
86026,"After receiving the initial item way too smal, I was able to return and receive a size that fits a lot better.",86026,4
86026,It's a very nice baiting suite so I am glad I was able to find a size that fits.,86026,4
86027,like the style .,86027,4
86027,"note: I wear a 34w pants , however , the large thermals are definitely too small compared to the size description in inches.",86027,4
86027,"waiting for label to return items , then I'll order next size up (XL).",86027,4
86028,"Gorgeous, great proportions, beautiful details.",86028,4
86028,"I hate chiffon, but love this blouse.",86028,4
86031,"Aside from being approximately one size too big, this is a nice tee,  I was going to exchange it for a smaller size, but it cost too much if I used the WW's pre-printed mailing label and my printer would not print the Amazon label (I assume that I would have had to pay for postage even if I could have printed it).",86031,4
86032,I like it but I haven't found a place that will fit a picture of my deceased mother in it.,86032,4
86032,"Therefore, I have not worn them as of yet & it's too late to return.",86032,4
86033,I am 5'4 and it is a little long and a little baggy on me; my first thought was that I had purchased pajamas.,86033,4
86033,But with the sleeves rolled up and the belt tied it actually looks pretty cute.,86033,4
86033,"I won't wear it to work, but I will wear it out on fall weekends!",86033,4
86034,I ordered medium (my waist size is 33-34) and tried mine on and it's very comfortable and cool.,86034,4
86034,"But BE AWARE: On the package itself, medium size is listed as it's for waist size 28-30, while on this website's size chart from product information, medium is listed as 32-34.",86034,4
86034,"The product itself is very stretchy and comfortable so I'm honestly satisfied with the product itself, so I'm taking one star off for the error in the size chart.",86034,4
86034,*****Seller: Please update your size chart.,86034,4
86035,"I was excited when it arrived, it is very cute, just like the picture, and is soft organic cotton.",86035,4
86035,"However, the newborn size barely fits my just over 5 lb daughter.",86035,4
86035,"She  was a preemie and can still wear one of her preemie hats, though it is getting a bit snug.",86035,4
86035,"This new hat fits almost exactly the same, with just a bit more room.",86035,4
86035,Unfortunately I washed it before putting it on her so I can not return it for a larger size.,86035,4
86035,The small fit is the reason for the one star deduction.,86035,4
86036,Very well made of heavy metal.,86036,4
86036,Looks great on my Civil war Lewis.,86036,4
86037,Great fit and feel.,86037,4
86038,"Very pretty, definitely had the effect I was going for - I love the look of multiple earrings, but I don't really want to go through piercing my ears several times each to achieve the look.",86038,4
86038,A lot of people are complaining that the earrings are heavy and don't stay vertical - I did have a little trouble with one of them slipping...But a dot of eyelash glue holds them in place all day and peels off easily.,86038,4
86038,Very happy with my purchase.,86038,4
86039,Cute fits good but didn't expect it to be the material it was...thought it would be not as shiny,86039,4
86040,"Does not really look like the picture on, but a very nice shirt.",86040,4
86040,Feels super lightweight which I like.,86040,4
86040,Arrived faster than expected.,86040,4
86041,"Nice weight, great spin action, nice length.",86041,4
86041,"Edit: a year later and I still really like the skirt, but it's pilling to much to wear on nice occasions.",86041,4
86041,"Too bad, it's such a nice fit and great look.",86041,4
86042,Idk this thing just feels awkward.,86042,4
86042,I guess that's the point of buying it though.,86042,4
86042,The sleeve is only maybe 5 or 6 inches long when its streched out fully if your junk is any bigger your dong might HULK TEAR out of it.,86042,4
86042,I think I'll try a different product.,86042,4
86043,This shirt looks and fits exactly like the image.,86043,4
86043,"It is medium heavy, but not clingy even a little bit!",86043,4
86043,"I ordered an 1XL (Because I am rather busty) and it fits perfectly, although the sleeves are a tad long but that is not a problem for me.",86043,4
86043,"It hangs beautifully and I wear the shirt, the shirt doesn't wear me.",86043,4
86043,That means total comfort!,86043,4
86043,"The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when it arrived, it smelled really really funny, almost like vinegar.",86043,4
86043,"I haven't washed it yet, but I'm sure the smell will disappear when I wash it.",86043,4
86043,"If it doesn't, I will re-submit this feedback to let you know.",86043,4
86043,"Overall though, I absolutely love this shirt.",86043,4
86043,"It was everything it claimed to be, and I received a lot better quality for the amount than I expected!",86043,4
86043,I'm on my way now to see if I can find some more Allegra brand shirts because I loved the quality so much.,86043,4
86043,UPDATE:  The smell I complained about?,86043,4
86043,Disappeared in about 30 minutes after hanging the shirt up to air.,86043,4
86043,Must have been the packaging!,86043,4
86043,The shirt is to die for!,86043,4
86043,You will love it,86043,4
86044,"Great quality,fits as expected",86044,4
86045,"As soon as I had a problem, they IMMEDIATELY responded and solved it!",86045,4
86046,A nice little necklace/bracelet that tries to emulate the 7 Chakras.,86046,4
86047,I ordered similar versions of this suit from multiple sources and this one was my favorite.,86047,4
86047,"It's Asian sizing so instead of my usual M/L, I ordered an XXL.",86047,4
86047,"The bandeau style top is thick and solid across the back, no hooks.",86047,4
86047,"Better support for larger bust but not a push up, more of a hold down style.",86047,4
86047,"The high waisted bottoms are lightly lined, not much tummy support but also appropriate elasticity around legs and waist as to not creat bulging.",86047,4
86047,This suit what you'd expect at this price point quality wise but you're getting a bargain in the cuteness department.,86047,4
86048,returned because of wrong address  my mistake,86048,4
86049,In my opinion it's not doable without some type of bra or bralette or you will have a nip slip.,86049,4
86049,I do not have big boobs.,86049,4
86049,"I'm 5'0, 130 pounds and 34A.",86049,4
86049,Very cute and airy though!,86049,4
86049,Would give five stars otherwise!,86049,4
86051,Quality is on par with price.,86051,4
86052,"Loved the shirt, the design, colors, and feel just wish the arm design wasn't so itchy!",86052,4
86053,Bought this outfit for a sailing cruise with friends.,86053,4
86053,Wanted something to hang around the deck that was more coverage than a swim suit but didn't worry if a sudden dip in the ocean occurred.,86053,4
86053,This is a fun and colorful outfit to wear in place of a swim suit.,86053,4
86053,The fit is a bit tight but forgiving since the material stretches.,86053,4
86053,My only complaint or rather criticism is the bra/cup that is sewn in.,86053,4
86053,It's quite padded and has an underwire for support.,86053,4
86053,"Unfortunately, the wire cuts into my side and pushes my breast out under my arms.",86053,4
86053,"I suppose it's made to push the breasts together for cleavage but I find the cup itself, too small and I'm not large busted.",86053,4
86053,"(34B) They also include some additional pads, in case you want extra large breasts...I do like the wide shoulder straps.",86053,4
86053,"I am just a little over 5 feet (when standing straight), am petite in shape, 105 Ibs., normally wear a size 4-6 in a bathing suit.",86053,4
86053,I ordered a medium and it was still a little tight.,86053,4
86053,"Others have commented on it running small and I took that into consideration, thankfully.",86053,4
86053,It's a keeper for me.,86053,4
86054,The shoulder straps are long and not adjustable.,86054,4
86054,I still like the shirt though.,86054,4
86057,"I love how it fits, great material, comfortable, great value",86057,4
86058,"I'm a little disappointed, because the pants they sent me was not what I ordere.",86058,4
86058,"Beyond that, the quality of the pant is good.",86058,4
86059,Perfect accessory for my pregnant wife.,86059,4
86059,"Though the size was larger than expected, she still loves it.",86059,4
86060,received as indicated and quality was as expected.,86060,4
86061,I got NB and it is almost as large as most of my 3mo clothing!,86061,4
86061,It is really cute though...I like to think one day miss Maya will be rolling to school listening to NWA and be tickled to find out she was sporting this from a wee age.,86061,4
86061,"Only have shown it to a couple people so far, but it's gotten laughs from those familiar and another expectant friend recently ordered one after seeing it.",86061,4
86061,Just know its for a baby at least 10+lbs,86061,4
86062,The black youth sunglasses were purchased for a cheerleading team that I coach.,86062,4
86062,I ordered these before I found a purple set that I liked also.,86062,4
86062,These sunglasses are really small.,86062,4
86062,They fit my 8 year old's face good but I think I should have went with the adult size.,86062,4
86062,The lens size is similar to sunglasses you would purchase for a toddler.,86062,4
86062,The lens is very dark and I think they will serve the purpose that we need them for.,86062,4
86062,"If you have been to a 3D movie and used the glasses they provide, that is what they are like.",86062,4
86062,The price is good at less than $1 a piece.,86062,4
86063,i like size but wider than i anticipated... should've read details a bit closer.,86063,4
86063,will work great for bigger purse though!,86063,4
86064,Wish there were more size to choose from,86064,4
86065,"2 months in - This belt is really nice for the  price...the leather seems like its actually a one piece strap(UNLIKE MOST BELTS UNDER $30) its pretty thick, and suprisingly soft.",86065,4
86065,"My only complaint is the cheap snaps but they work, so for $20 who cares!",86065,4
86065,"Does not come with a buckle, unfortunately, for those who don't got one.",86065,4
86066,It was smaller than I thought.,86066,4
86066,You have to look closely to see serve and protect wording.,86066,4
86066,"However, it does fit nicely on her Pandora charm bracelet.",86066,4
86067,"Was somewhat large, but I liked",86067,4
86068,i wear s normally.,86068,4
86068,i ordered m for this one.,86068,4
86069,Always my go-to for fake piercings!,86069,4
86069,Can get a little sore if you have it where flesh is thicker for a long time but that's just the nature of the beast.,86069,4
86073,The dress was super cute.,86073,4
86073,I really liked the material.,86073,4
86073,I am usually a 6/8 and ordered an extra large based on size chart and it was a little bit too big.,86073,4
86073,Overall fits nicely though and was able to wear to a luau party.,86073,4
86075,"Super cute, and fits well.",86075,4
86076,"Even though it's a little big, it's just what I wanted.",86076,4
86079,These were great for an 80s party.,86079,4
86079,They are super comfortable too.,86079,4
86079,I wear a size 12 pant and this fit me perfectly.,86079,4
86080,"Ordered a X-LARGE (white bikini), I am usually a medium but I read reviews so I sized up ; It fit like a glove , perfect.",86080,4
86080,"Also, just want to mention I bought 2 one black and the other white which was perfect.",86080,4
86080,"I am returning the black because it too is a ""Xlarge"" except when compare side by side clearly the black is not a xlarge more like a small.",86080,4
86081,"I'm 5' 2"" 170lbs and got a large.",86081,4
86081,It fits well on the booty and tummy but the top part is a little loose and your boobs totally come out if they are not snug in it.,86081,4
86081,might alter it or use the double sided tape trick.,86081,4
86081,The color is really pretty too.,86081,4
86082,"Nice coat, a little warm for San Francisco but.......it has a removable lining!",86082,4
86082,Great quality and price.,86082,4
86082,Exactly like the Ellen Tracey one my husband bought me for Christmas and $200 less.,86082,4
86082,Only con is that it runs small.,86082,4
86084,It's a lovely top and it was a bit snugg but so much to send it back.,86084,4
86084,If your a plus size woman you may want to get a size larger.,86084,4
86084,I normally wear a 20 and ordered a 22 it's just a tad bit snugged in the arms.,86084,4
86084,But not enough that I wouldn't wear it.,86084,4
86084,Only other thing I say is there was a smell to the top but a quick wash in the gentle cycle and air dry and it was fine,86084,4
86085,"Actually, these women's 11-11.5 (men's 9-9.5) fit like women's 10-10.5.",86085,4
86085,"I have found that whenever one buys unisex sizing, the difference is 1 size bigger for women than for men.",86085,4
86085,"I submerged my misgivings and went by the Powerstep size guide and their women's 10-10.5 were too small, necessitating an exchange.",86085,4
86085,"Be aware these orthotics raise one's heels sufficiently that in some lo-rise shoes, when you remove the insole and replace with these, your heel may be elevated enough to start slipping.",86085,4
86085,"I am going to use these in 2 pairs of high-top boots that I have, where it doesn't matter.",86085,4
86086,This is a gorgeous top.,86086,4
86086,"The material is thin and flowy, a flattering look on any body type.",86086,4
86087,It is cute indeed but it the guitar neck broke within a few weeks.,86087,4
86087,I'm sad about it.,86087,4
86087,I was using it as a charm on my bags.,86087,4
86087,It is sparkly for sure!,86087,4
86088,Extremely hard for baby to pull off and easy for adults to put on.,86088,4
86088,"I got them when my daughter was 8 months and she had a little room to grow in them, but they weren't huge.",86088,4
86088,Now at 1 year they fit snugly.,86088,4
86088,Non skid as described.,86088,4
86088,Perfect when baby is learning to stand and starting to walk.,86088,4
86088,"They are cheaply made, but not bad quality and they've held up through many washes.",86088,4
86088,I just wish they came with more pairs in the pack for the price.,86088,4
86089,"I don't have anything bad to say about them, their socks.",86089,4
86089,"I like the height, and the gel on the heel for non slippage is cool.",86089,4
86089,I'd buy them again.,86089,4
86090,"Cute little hat, light weight, pretty and easy to wear",86090,4
86091,Looks perfect on my son a little difficult to get on but fits great,86091,4
86092,Pretty wonderful pair of boots!,86092,4
86092,The color is true to the picture ( I ordered red for cosplay.),86092,4
86092,I would definitely recommend that you order half a size up because the toes are a little constricting.,86092,4
86093,Perfect for warmer days and the colors are soft in hue.,86093,4
86095,i'm tall so that is important for me.,86095,4
86095,"got a ""run"" in the first one i wore, but ordered 4 so i'm good.",86095,4
86095,will be more carful when puttin the next one on.,86095,4
86099,The jacket fits nicely but I wouldn't wear a thick sweater under it.,86099,4
86099,I love the color and the fur keeps  you warm.,86099,4
86099,"The only issue is that the fur will shed into your shirts, So don't wear it with light shirts.",86099,4
86100,hurts at night but other than that love it.,86100,4
86101,The lenses are a little smaller than I expected but I still love!,86101,4
86102,The size is just too small.,86102,4
86102,Great looking jacket though.,86102,4
86102,Will have to return and won't be able to get a size larger because Large is as big as they come.,86102,4
86104,cute cheap and good suit the only thing is it stunk and wires were all twisted.,86104,4
86106,I'm skinny and ordered a size up and it fits tightly.,86106,4
86106,Not a chance to be able to wear heavy clothes underneath,86106,4
86107,Shows off the manly parts and the wife thinks they're sexy which works for me.,86107,4
86107,We'll see how long they last.,86107,4
86108,"When it arrived, about an inch of stitching on the drape was hanging loose.",86108,4
86108,So much for QC.,86108,4
86108,It wasn't worth sending back so I sewed it up myself.,86108,4
86108,Also the one size fits all is a little tight on my big head.,86108,4
86108,"But other than that, it is stylish and blocks the sun well.",86108,4
86108,It has also survived one machine wash on the gentle cycle.,86108,4
86108,"For the price, I'm satisfied.",86108,4
86109,Grandson said it was too big,86109,4
86110,This shirt is smaller than others I own and have purchased of the same size.,86110,4
86110,I would like to replace it with the next larger size.,86110,4
86111,"great deal price n quality
did shrink more than normal item so u might want to avoid the dryer",86111,4
86112,"Good product,fits nice,breathable and comfortable,does not pinch like other waist trainers I have used.",86112,4
86113,Works but it runs small,86113,4
86114,"I LOVE the shirt, but it is a tad too big.",86114,4
86114,"I'm 5'8"" with a 36D bust about 140lbs.",86114,4
86115,Delivered promptly as suggested.,86115,4
86116,The only reason for four stars is I ordered a few sizes larger than normal because I like a loose fit.,86116,4
86116,Well the reviews said it shrunk so two sizes of shrinkage when I expected one size of shrinkage.,86116,4
86116,Lucky I ordered two sizes larger than normal but now I have a nightie I love the design and fabric but not the shrinkage.,86116,4
86116,I never even dried in a dryer.,86116,4
86116,I hang to dry.,86116,4
86117,"Very slick and well designed, but smaller than expected.",86117,4
86117,This is more the size of a pencil case than a dopp kit / toiletry case.,86117,4
86117,"If you are taking a longer trip, this probably won't be large enough.",86117,4
86118,This outfit is very cute but very poorly made.,86118,4
86118,The snaps are super cheap and I don't expect them to last long.,86118,4
86118,The material is very thin as well.,86118,4
86118,But for the price you really can't expect more.,86118,4
86118,"Even though it shipped from China, it came relatively quickly.",86118,4
86118,it runs quite big in my opinion.,86118,4
86118,At least 3-4 months too big.,86118,4
86118,Kids grow out of stuff so quickly anyways.,86118,4
86118,I would recommend this outfit but just go into it knowing then it's not good quality.,86118,4
86119,This is comfortable and cool to sleep in.,86119,4
86119,"I would rate it a 5 star if the print wasn't a little ""grandmotherish"" but that isn't a bad thing, right?",86119,4
86120,"Not bad for the price, came pretty early as well.",86120,4
86120,The ribbon was poor quality and ripped after a couple of hours.,86120,4
86120,I sewed in new ribbon and it was fine.,86120,4
86121,Order two sizes up!!,86121,4
86121,"It's super warm, & definitely worth the money.",86121,4
86123,"Loosened all the way up, they are quite comfy.",86123,4
86123,"I am also thinner, though, so if you're of a meatier composition and the same height, just be aware.",86123,4
86123,"They would probably still work, but they might be a touch too tight.",86123,4
86124,This bra is super comfortable and the pale pink color is lovely.,86124,4
86124,The clips are sturdy and have held up well over 5 months of use.,86124,4
86124,"The reasons I bumped it down one star are

1.",86124,4
86124,Rather than having molded cups it has removable pads- which are large enough that the outline doesn't show through - but can get easily folded up when unclipped and are a pain to fix.,86124,4
86124,"After washing it a few times it started polling, just kind of annoying.",86124,4
86124,"The straps in the back seem to be really wide-set, so they sometimes ride down my shoulders and show outside of almost any tank top I wear.",86124,4
86124,"Really I'd give it a 3.5 for those reasons,  but since you can't I rounded up- it is a super comfy around-the-house and running-quick-errands bra

For reference i'm a 36D - 36DD and the large fits well",86124,4
86125,The sunglasses were absolutely what I was expecting!!,86125,4
86125,I was a bit skeptical at first glance as the box was very damaged.,86125,4
86125,"The sunglasses were still perfectly fine, no scratches, etc.",86125,4
86125,They fit well and I received them very quickly!,86125,4
86128,The ring is a gift and am thinking about buying one for myself.,86128,4
86128,It's pretty but the stones were lighter than the pic.,86128,4
86128,still a nice ring.,86128,4
86130,Very cute and nicely made,86130,4
86132,The top is a little small(small cups) and has less than enough support.,86132,4
86132,but I can still wear it.,86132,4
86133,A little big on me but they're perfect,86133,4
86135,I normally wear a medium so I ordered a large just incase and the large is even a bit tight.,86135,4
86135,The shirt is cute though and I enjoy wearing it.,86135,4
86137,This is a great replacement insert for those who still like to carry a lot of pictures and cards around in your wallet.,86137,4
86137,"It's a bit thick, but works fine as a replacement.",86137,4
86138,It's a gift for my brother and way too small for him.,86138,4
86138,"I'm guessing there's no other sizes, and that's a shame.",86138,4
86138,"It looks great, just can't be worn.",86138,4
86140,Fits a little big and is a lot larger of a brim than I was expecting but I love it.,86140,4
86140,I give it 4/5 because I don't think it breathes in the top of the head as well as it could.,86140,4
86140,"I still recommend it, it bailed me out at a festival today and several people asked me where I got it.",86140,4
86140,Get one while the getting good!,86140,4
86141,I like this a lot.,86141,4
86141,"I had to take it in a bit cause it was wide, and it is also a bit short in the torso so I get some camel toe..",86141,4
86141,"Sexy though, and comfortable for the most part.",86141,4
86141,Oh except for the second to top button coming right off when I first got it.,86141,4
86142,Very cute & the material is thick.,86142,4
86145,The dress came a few days earlier than expected and it beautiful!,86145,4
86145,The top part is very delicate and the snap fixtures seem pretty cheap.,86145,4
86145,"Other than that, it was a very good buy.",86145,4
86145,"A little big in the bust, but it's an easy fix.",86145,4
86147,material is kind of thin but it will work for hanging at the beach,86147,4
86148,X Large fit just right.,86148,4
86148,It is long but will work fine with heels.,86148,4
86148,A slip is necessary it is transparent.,86148,4
86149,Nice for the money not lined so perfect for summer,86149,4
86151,Nice quality and style but runs big!,86151,4
86151,Will have to return.,86151,4
86152,A LITTLE PRICEY......BUT WORTH THE MONEY,86152,4
86153,The balance to the force.,86153,4
86153,And my outfit .,86153,4
86154,My 9 year old daughter loves these shoes.,86154,4
86156,The only thing id say is they are a little big in the tummy so next time i order im getting a size smaller.,86156,4
86156,It has belt loops so that could be fixed with a belt if you like belts.,86156,4
86156,Other than that the length is perfect im 5'3 and they look great.,86156,4
86157,"very pretty, small, good for pencil case, small lipstick bag, or good for lip or eye liners.",86157,4
86158,Runs a little large otherwise nice product.,86158,4
86159,It worked out well for my son but it was hard to see out of so we had to cut holes in the eyes.,86159,4
86159,Due to the moisture from him breathing out of his mouth a few of the teeth peeled off.,86159,4
86159,He loved the costume!,86159,4
86160,"I like it , Color and look the same like picture.",86160,4
86160,i am happy with it.,86160,4
86161,The bodice is slightly short.,86161,4
86161,"But the hind coverage is awesome and tight enough to stay down, which is always a big issue for me.",86161,4
86161,Cute shape on the body!,86161,4
86162,Good qualities easy use,86162,4
86163,These work great for swimming.,86163,4
86163,My son calls them his underwear!,86163,4
86163,He is 2 and we bought the 3T.,86163,4
86163,"However, they do take a long time to dry on the line/ in the sun.",86163,4
86163,I'm really glad I bought the 2 pack.,86163,4
86163,Its also nice that they have the side snaps to my taking off easier.,86163,4
86164,I went by the measurements on the left of the page and bought a 10/12 (my normal size).,86164,4
86164,"It's a ""tish"" big.",86164,4
86164,I probably could have gone 1 size down and been just fine.,86164,4
86164,Chest area is around 38 and I had to wear a padded bra to help fill out the top area.,86164,4
86164,There is a zipper on the side of the dress.,86164,4
86164,I did remove the bow up front (at 40 I'm a bit old for a bow) but added a gold belt from amazon.,86164,4
86164,"It has a nice ""flow"" or ""twirl"" effect (my 3yr old daughter loves to twirl with me).",86164,4
86164,"The dress is comfortable, and I would recommend.",86164,4
86164,I bought the black one.,86164,4
86165,This is a very nice piece of jewelry that is very flattering.,86165,4
86165,Can be worn with most anything so I am glad that I purchased it.,86165,4
86166,This suit is so cute...and you need to order a size up.,86166,4
86166,I did that and fitsBeautifully.,86166,4
86166,Think material with a great liner.,86166,4
86168,The case is great.,86168,4
86168,Package was nicely coverd with air bagd to ensure the care of the case with the glasses.,86168,4
86168,They are worth the amount.,86168,4
86168,Unlike cheap glasses which are usually light weight.,86168,4
86168,These feel like quality glasses with good hard plastic.,86168,4
86168,Great shine to them and clean lens,86168,4
86169,Purchased for daughters comic-con outfit.,86169,4
86169,She liked them so much she has worn them as jammy bottoms as well.,86169,4
86170,I have been throughly impressed by this wallet.,86170,4
86170,I received it last week and immediately began using it.,86170,4
86170,The packaging was nice.,86170,4
86170,"And the leather is extremely soft, no break in needed.",86170,4
86170,"My only issue,is I wish there was a Window for our License.",86170,4
86170,Other then that I would definitely buy another one.,86170,4
86171,Would have given full ratings but as it's too big in bust area.,86171,4
86171,Need some alterations to fit.,86171,4
86171,It's a pretty dress.,86171,4
86172,Purchased as a gift for grand son.,86172,4
86173,"I like this
Strangely enough I am having difficulty finding replacement sticky notes that are the same size to fit the compartments.",86173,4
86173,It may be that it's designed for the consumer to have to purchase the entire box again when one runs out of stickies.,86173,4
86175,The balls tend to fall off even when I feel they are as tight as can be.,86175,4
86175,But for the price can't complain.,86175,4
86175,I love and have had no problems with redness or infection.,86175,4
86175,These are super cute!,86175,4
86176,This fit me perfect.,86176,4
86176,I love the crochet style and stretch.,86176,4
86176,It is very short but that's okay because it is meant to be worn over a swimsuit at the beach or lake.,86176,4
86177,I am usually a small/medium and I ordered a large and it fit well.,86177,4
86178,Exelent cuality and very sof material,86178,4
86179,snug but nice fit.,86179,4
86181,granddaughter loved it for the Renaissance fair,86181,4
86182,"They are not bad, look a little cheap.",86182,4
86182,Touch screen works pretty good as well.,86182,4
86183,It would have been perfect.,86183,4
86183,"The size was exactly what I was looking for and since I am planning on using it as a wallet most of the time, the fact that the leather doesn't look very genuine doesn't even bother me.",86183,4
86183,"The only thing I don't like, surprisingly, is the smell.",86183,4
86183,It's a very strong odor and very unpleasant.,86183,4
86183,"Going to try fabreeze, or a dryer sheet or something and hope it gets better because I really like it otherwise.",86183,4
86184,The product arrived on time and it fits great.,86184,4
86185,My fianc has an amazing ass and looks incredible in panties like these but unfortunately these ones were a little too snug.,86185,4
86185,The one size fits all approach is frustrating as I would reorder in a larger size but can't.,86185,4
86186,I followed other reviews that said this ran small and ordered up.,86186,4
86186,"I typically wear L, or M depending on the style.",86186,4
86186,"Ordered XL, they are a bit too big.",86186,4
86186,"With it being a thong made out of stretchy lace, I think ordering your typical size would give you the best fit.",86186,4
86186,I deducted a star because I had to trim stray threads off of every pair.,86186,4
86186,That kind of sloppiness annoys me.,86186,4
86186,"Overall, would recommend them...great value for the price.",86186,4
86187,"This was a good nose ring, a hundred times better than those you would purchase at places like hot topic or spencers.",86187,4
86187,The clicker stays shut and I have had no problems with it.,86187,4
86187,It is quite large around looks somewhat awkward in my own nose but the ring itself is beautiful.,86187,4
86188,A little smaller than I was expecting based on other reviews.,86188,4
86188,I'm using it for storage for extra cash for quick store errands.,86188,4
86188,If the money isn't in perfectly the zipper gets stuck.,86188,4
86188,Otherwise very nicely made.,86188,4
86190,"the shoulders are bit weird though, maybe because i'm a woman and the shirt's fitted for a guy?",86190,4
86191,The ears fit well as a headband and don't pinch anywhere or get uncomfortable after a few hours.,86191,4
86191,The bow is leather like but much more comfortable and is somewhat adjustable so that it's not too tight around the neck.,86191,4
86191,The tail was the biggest problem as it only has a loop to connect to whatever you're wearing but doesn't include any pins or string to tie around the waist.,86191,4
86191,No problems with quality.,86191,4
86192,"A lil small, but otherwise loved it.",86192,4
86193,Ordered it on a Tuesday (expedited) got it Friday!,86193,4
86193,Belt fits true to size and is in pretty good condition!,86193,4
86194,we like the product.,86194,4
86195,"I mistakenly ordered a medium instead of a small, but i'll keep them because they're not so big that I can't wear them.",86195,4
86195,The color is great and they're still comfortable.,86195,4
86197,"Okay, I like it a lot, but this is not a U.S size 8 lol.",86197,4
86197,"I'm a size 4 and When i zip it, it only comes at the very last end.",86197,4
86197,I have to turn it to the front where my stomach is at.,86197,4
86197,I don't know is it because of my butt or what but an size 8 u.s size would be loose on me.,86197,4
86197,Overall like it but the sizing isn't right.,86197,4
86198,It takes a few days to get used to it.,86198,4
86198,Once you are used to it then it feel nice.,86198,4
86198,"But my heel still hurts at times, not as much before like with the default insoles that came along with the shoes.",86198,4
86198,I use it with my running shoes but I do mostly walking with them.,86198,4
86199,Loved the shirt if u followed the size chart it will fit !,86199,4
86200,This underwear feels great and has plenty of air circulation because of the material it is made with.,86200,4
86200,It is not made with cotton.,86200,4
86200,More of an elastic material.,86200,4
86200,The only reason I gave 4 stars is that you have to get two sizes bigger than your usual size.,86200,4
86200,I'm usually a large and has to get 2XL for it to fit.,86200,4
86200,Other than that great underwear!,86200,4
86202,They fit pretty well - the front strap is adjustable (which I JUST discovered!!),86202,4
86202,and so is the cross strap buckle.,86202,4
86202,"I just got them today (that's why only 4 stars), so I'm not sure yet how long I'll be able to wear them, but I'm planning on wearing them poolside soon!!",86202,4
86202,I have heel pain fairly easily so I wanted something with some support as I can't wear flats.,86202,4
86202,"I have another pair of Vionics, and like those, so I thought these would be comfortable too.",86202,4
86202,I was not disappointed!!,86202,4
86203,"The fit was right on, comfortable too.",86203,4
86204,It a small fit for a xl,86204,4
86205,It's warm and comfy,86205,4
86206,Love the design idea.,86206,4
86206,Sturdy but not too heavy.,86206,4
86206,Only issue is it is a little big.,86206,4
86212,"These are a fantastic & cheap way to ""hide"" your piercing.",86212,4
86212,I put hide into quotations because they late flat against your lip - almost invisible - when your mouth is flat.,86212,4
86212,But when you smile the labrets stick out.,86212,4
86212,"So people will be able to notice you have piercings, put ALOT less than regular labrets or rings.",86212,4
86212,"Also, these are perfect length, not too short.",86212,4
86212,They also came safely packaged and within a coulpe days.,86212,4
86212,If you need a quick fix then I definitely recommend these!,86212,4
86212,My only complaint is they are not completely straight.,86212,4
86212,But still perfectly fine in.,86212,4
86212,"Oh, they don't damage your teeth either cause they aren't metal!!",86212,4
86212,: D Thank you.,86212,4
86213,This is very light weight and pretty.,86213,4
86213,The design was exactly what the picture showed.,86213,4
86213,But the strings are too long and some of them are tied together like they weren't long enough  The arms are the right lengths and it goes to about right under my knee overall it's very pretty,86213,4
86214,It's a little to big.,86214,4
86214,"I like the look though, and enjoy wearing it",86214,4
86215,"For inexpensive pajamas, these are nice.",86215,4
86215,"They fit well, perhaps just a drop on the small side, and of course, my 5 year old grandson adores the design.",86215,4
86216,was to small so gave it as  gift,86216,4
86218,"Nice belt, good looking, appears to be of good quality, but only time will tell, so 4 stars for now and if it holds up to test of time, will update review.",86218,4
86218,"Important, be sure not to cut belt too short as the notches that lock belt into place don't go all the way to end of belt.",86218,4
86218,I almost cut the length too short.,86218,4
86219,I ordered a size up and it fits perfect.,86219,4
86219,I'm a little chubby from having a baby but it's fits comfortably,86219,4
86220,"Love the design and material, wish it had more storage pockets but other than that i love it.",86220,4
86221,I bought size 9-12 for my 9 month old twin girls who are small for their age.,86221,4
86221,The quality is decent for the price and they seem comfortable on their feet.,86221,4
86221,"My girls feet measure 4.25"" inches from heel to big toe and they have about a half inch spare room in the bootie.",86221,4
86221,They also have very narrow feet so it may fit a baby with a chubby foot better.,86221,4
86221,"Overall, I am satisfied with this purchase, but I would not recommend this for a walker.",86221,4
86221,"Also, it took 2 weeks from the day I made the purchase until I received the order.",86221,4
86222,A little big in the neck.,86222,4
86222,Falls off the baby'baby's shoulders.,86222,4
86223,It is a beautiful piece and I'm very happy with the quality of the ring.,86223,4
86223,I only regret that the size made available to me was slightly too big.,86223,4
86224,"It's a great lightweight top, but it does run smaller than indicated.",86224,4
86224,I'm a medium usually but I should have bought the large in this item.,86224,4
86224,otherwise it's a great jacket.,86224,4
86225,Un poco largo pero sexy,86225,4
86226,These fit true to size for my little one.,86226,4
86226,They are light weight and don't hold water.,86226,4
86226,I tried other water shoes and they got heavy when in the water.,86226,4
86226,The color is vibrant too which is fun for the summer time.,86226,4
86227,Very nice little blue shrug.,86227,4
86227,"while it's not natural material, it still feels all right and definitely complements the outfits intended.",86227,4
86228,the quality was a little less than I expected but cool top definitely a crop top your belly is out.,86228,4
86228,I get so many compliments when I wear it,86228,4
86229,I loved how soft and delicate the lace material was.,86229,4
86229,"It came in sooner than expected, and although it's a bit toolong, I'm also a bit shorter.",86229,4
86229,"I do not regret my purchase, especially considering the excellent price.",86229,4
86230,Wish you had other colors,86230,4
86231,"Nice color, but too large and long.",86231,4
86231,Have to make some alterations,86231,4
86232,I feel ridiculous in the top but the bottoms are just what I was looking for.,86232,4
86233,"It's a great top, a little smaller than the other smalls in RBX",86233,4
86234,"very comfortable, good support, and looks great.",86234,4
86234,"the only downside is that there is nothing holding the pads in place, so after washing it takes some effort to move the pads back, and after several washes starts to loose it's shape.",86234,4
86235,"Looks just the way they are advertise, received lots of compliments on them.",86235,4
86236,My four year old daughter loves dresses and tights.,86236,4
86236,She refuses to wear pants even on the coldest winter days.,86236,4
86236,I bought these leg warmers to add to her outfits for a little extra warmth and style.,86236,4
86236,They are very nice.,86236,4
86236,I like that they are not too thick or too sheer.,86236,4
86236,They are about the same thickness as regular cable tights.,86236,4
86236,"I would give them more than three stars, but we have only had them for a few weeks and one pair had a snag that developed even though I hand dried them.",86236,4
86236,"They could also could be made from a softer, more natural material.",86236,4
86236,"All in all, they are great for what we need and the colors work for just about any outfit.",86236,4
86236,"Price wise, they are perfect.",86236,4
86237,it is a wallet of good material.,86237,4
86237,"however, it breaks the cards especially if you put it in the back pocket and sit.",86237,4
86238,"Love it, fits great!",86238,4
86238,"The sleeves are very thin, not sure how long it will last before it tears, but I really like the blouse.",86238,4
86239,"I love it its soft inside and oit, but if you like jackets bigger I would suggest 1 size bigger or 2.",86239,4
86239,"I wear a medium but got a large, i wish i would have got an x-large",86239,4
86240,"As described, but not super flattering.",86240,4
86241,It's a bit small but I lived it.,86241,4
86241,It's so different with the gorgeous pleats in the back almost want to wear it backwards.,86241,4
86242,But do.not buy these if you  have big  legs.,86242,4
86242,It just won't workout  these.,86242,4
86242,Are for slim people.,86242,4
86242,But I workout my legs there for I have big legs.and it was.,86242,4
86243,Check the size chart first!,86243,4
86243,"Go with what is recommended and then wash the socks first, otherwise they'll seem a bit too large.",86243,4
86243,Fit is great and the silicone heel is perfect for preventing heel slide.,86243,4
86244,I got it two sizes up and it was still pretty snug,86244,4
86245,Great for the cost.,86245,4
86246,"I'm small, I wear a size 1/2 in normal clothing and this would've fit but I was too tall 5'6 and it bunched in the crotch.",86246,4
86246,I love the outfit though.,86246,4
86246,Going to order a M and see if that works out better.,86246,4
86246,"Very cute romper, especially for the price.",86246,4
86247,"Cute PJs, the shirt is a bit small for my son (wearing 3T shirts)",86247,4
86248,"First I would like to say my hoodie didn't have hoodie strings and is wine red, not the bright red you see pictured.",86248,4
86248,I bought this is in xxl.,86248,4
86248,It took well over a month to get it.,86248,4
86248,But it fits and is even a bit baggy!,86248,4
86248,"For reference I am 5'6"" 156lbs.",86248,4
86248,"I bought another one of these hoodies in white and pink in a large and it was more fitted, but I also weighed 135 at that time.",86248,4
86249,"It came a bit on the large size, but shrunk quite a bit when I washed it.",86249,4
86249,"Hung it to dry, and brushed out the fur collar.",86249,4
86249,Will be a just right fit now,86249,4
86250,"So, I'm giving this 4 stars for one reason and one reason only.",86250,4
86250,My Wife likes them.,86250,4
86250,Although not on me.,86250,4
86250,"I kid you not I ordered US-8 Large, and while my 34 waist could barely BARELY squeeze into them I could.",86250,4
86250,"So I offered them to my wife (who is a petite, probably a Medium or smaller).",86250,4
86250,"She LOVES them, maybe a seam in an odd place but she wore them all day with no complaints lol.",86250,4
86251,I love pugs and can never turn down the opportunity for a low cost ankle sock to add to my collection.,86251,4
86251,"The top hangs over my ankle just a little, but I am a petite person with size 6 feet.",86251,4
86251,They are very cute and perfect for the price.,86251,4
86251,"Yes they took a while to come in, but the cost and cuteness factor override that.",86251,4
86252,My cell phone (with case) fits perfectly in the the pocket on the right leg.,86252,4
86252,I've been buying these pants for years.,86252,4
86252,They get the soft feel after the first wash.,86252,4
86253,"Size was my mistake, delivery was quick, I will order more in the future.",86253,4
86254,"Haven't worn, but for the price, a good wardrobe addition",86254,4
86255,"The description should change from ""short"" to very short.""",86255,4
86255,I kind of like it anyway.,86255,4
86255,It's cute and I like the colors....The sizing is not anyway near what it says it is.,86255,4
86256,Is what I expected,86256,4
86257,Cons: the color isn't as bright of an orange.,86257,4
86257,"It is more like a ""warm orange"".",86257,4
86257,"Also, I am 6 ft 260lbs, so like every ""long"" pants in my life, I have to wear them like capris.",86257,4
86257,Smh .. at the struggle.,86257,4
86257,"But I am sure for average height women, it will be the perfect length...so don't let my review deter your purchase.",86257,4
86257,Pros: Stays up and is true to size.,86257,4
86257,I bought an XL and it fits great.,86257,4
86257,"Since I am curvy at the hips, most pants ride down.",86257,4
86257,These stay up well.,86257,4
86258,"Bottoms really small, loved the top!",86258,4
86259,Like this shirt  need a tank underneath  but great for summer,86259,4
86260,I ordered it last minute for a wedding and it fit perfectly.,86260,4
86260,The only drawback I would say is that it wrinkles pretty quickly.,86260,4
86260,"I had to take an iron to it more than once but for the price, it was worth it.",86260,4
86261,Great fit; great price.,86261,4
86261,Paid less than half of what the optometrist was asking for this!,86261,4
86262,Would've given 5 stars if the fit was a tad bit better.,86262,4
86262,"The bandeau part fits great but it's a tiny bit baggy in the middle, not terribly noticeable to others but I noticed.",86262,4
86262,Otherwise I got a lot of compliments.,86262,4
86262,I will say the coverage on the butt is a little skimpy and I have a small rear end so if you're more endowed it may be more than you're wanting!,86262,4
86263,"I love the shirt, it's just too small.",86263,4
86263,"It is an XXL, which is a size that I normally wear, but it'seems much too small.",86263,4
86263,Maybe I can find someone  else to take it.,86263,4
86264,My daughter loves these.,86264,4
86264,"They're as cute as the picture shows, but remember, they run a little small.",86264,4
86265,"The front sarong adds modesty, but does not get in the way during water aerobics like a skirt does.",86265,4
86267,My daughter wears it for swim lessons.,86267,4
86267,"My only compliant, the 2nd time she wore it, she tugged at the part where the snaps are- but after a few minutes it didn't bother her anymore.",86267,4
86269,I like it overall a bit long....but the quality was of my expectations..It's cute the charm is kinda small but its noticeable,86269,4
86270,The shirt is very thin so only good for layering.,86270,4
86270,Also fit a little small,86270,4
86271,I forgot which size I ordered since it was for last Halloween 2016.,86271,4
86271,"But will wear again, kept me warm in the cold rain last year.",86271,4
86271,Be warned the gray fussy things do tend to shed,86271,4
86272,It is smaller than what I expected but il is nice,86272,4
86273,"These are nice pants, very soft.",86273,4
86273,I ordered them for my mother who has dementia and cannot work zippers or buttons.,86273,4
86274,Great for work and comfortable too!,86274,4
86275,"Got a little tarnish, but overall a good product.",86275,4
86276,I purchased this dress in a size small.,86276,4
86276,I'm 5 ft 6 and about 125lbs.,86276,4
86276,This dress comes up a little over my ankles.,86276,4
86276,"Loose, stretchy material, not as form fitting as I'd expected.",86276,4
86276,Cute and comfy dress though.,86276,4
86276,The orange color is VERY bright.,86276,4
86277,these would have been perfect if the had better venting,86277,4
86278,"I am 5'5"", long legs, short torso, around 135 pounds.",86278,4
86278,The large fits well and looks great.,86278,4
86278,"I like a more modest style for swimwear, and this fits the bill.",86278,4
86278,Fabric and design are really cute.,86278,4
86279,The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it was missing the belt.,86279,4
86279,Not a super big deal.,86279,4
86279,Can't wait to wear it.,86279,4
86282,I would suggest getting one size larger than your regular size.,86282,4
86282,This item tends to run slightly small,86282,4
86283,Purchased as a gift.,86283,4
86284,"I'm a true size 8 medium so I knew these would be snug because of the XS-M sizing,  But they do fit, are comfortable & are really inexpensive so I'm pleased.",86284,4
86286,"I was looking for undershirts for my navy uniform, these aren't quite the right color and they are a little short.",86286,4
86286,"Other than that, they function well as a shirt.",86286,4
86287,Not leather some kind of fake leather but it will hold up as an every other day belt and the design is as shown.,86287,4
86288,Carhartt makes a few different pants some seem a bit more heavy duty but these are good late fall early spring pants for the  job sight.,86288,4
86289,I originally thought that some portion of the sales of this attractive cap were to help victims and families of the Pulse Nightclub tragedy due to the sellers description of the item but apparently I was wrong.,86289,4
86289,"The seller is someone in Canada and the cap came to me directly from ""Pu Tian Shi Fujian 351100 China"".",86289,4
86289,"There was nothing that came with it that mentioned anything about ""Orlando Nightclub Gay Pride"".",86289,4
86289,"I feel that it is shameful to profit from the deaths and heartaches left by the many victims and I will make a personal donation to the proper organization in Orlando, FL.",86289,4
86289,"Otherwise, as I said it is a very attractive cap with symbols of man and man and woman and woman dancing happily together.",86289,4
86289,I do not normally buy cheap plastic snapback caps opting for sized or stretch only but I will keep it nonetheless as it is nice looking and would probably cost me more hassle to return it to China.,86289,4
86289,Finally I would urge the seller to donate something to the families of the lost.,86289,4
86291,Purchased a 40 Short.,86291,4
86291,"No tags sewn into clothes that had the actual size, just the label on the trash that was tied into the sleeve.",86291,4
86292,Purchased as a Christmas gift.,86292,4
86294,Very cool design and I was pleased with everything I ordered for the price.,86294,4
86294,The fit was a bit small.,86294,4
86294,I can tell the quality of the hoodie is not the greatest.,86294,4
86294,Thin material and I forsee it shrinking a size once put through the wash.,86294,4
86294,I'd recommend a larger size so when you do wash it it shrinks to your true size.,86294,4
86294,Other than that very pleased with the product.,86294,4
86295,A bit short but my son thought it was hilarious and unique.,86295,4
86296,Doesn't state size so I wasn't sure how it would fit.,86296,4
86296,5'3 130lbs 34 A and room to stretch a few sizes bigger,86296,4
86297,"Fit small, made a great gift for my granddaughter.",86297,4
86299,"It looks nice, but is 2 sizes too big.",86299,4
86300,These inserts helped out my shoes enough that I can wear them again.,86300,4
86300,"l had given up wearing two pairs of shoes that had originally been great, but after a year of wearing them, they had lost their support and cushioning, even though the rest of the shoe is still holding up great.",86300,4
86300,"With these inserts, the shoes are wearable again.",86300,4
86300,Inserts are certainly cheaper than a new pair of athletic shoes!,86300,4
86301,"Fits great but too short, otherwise 5 stars.",86301,4
86301,I'm 5 ft 4 inches.,86301,4
86302,I order the wrong length,86302,4
86303,I bought this backpack for my daughter who is in fourth grade and has a heavy load of books.,86303,4
86303,I love the design.,86303,4
86303,The only issue to why I didn't leave 5 stars is that the handle to pull the back pack is a little flimsy.,86303,4
86303,"I feel that in the future it might break, children are not usually gentle on their items.",86303,4
86303,Otherwise very good quality.,86303,4
86303,Have not had any issues thus far!,86303,4
86304,Very thin easily snags.,86304,4
86304,This shirt was sewn differently than the other I have in pale pink.,86304,4
86304,"It's the same pattern, just flipped.",86304,4
86304,"Short on my long torso, but I purchased the largest to get the drape.",86304,4
86305,received what i expected for this price.,86305,4
86306,I can't get this toe ring to fit correctly like on the picture...it moves around way too easily.,86306,4
86306,I've had other toe rings before and you generally just mold it to your toe but this one does not stay in place.,86306,4
86307,Well it really does run small.,86307,4
86307,Which baffles me if this is plus size.,86307,4
86307,"The large fit, but it fit a tad too snugly.",86307,4
86307,I still like the look the bathing suit.,86307,4
86307,I just want one that fits.,86307,4
86307,So I'm going to go up a size and cross my fingers.,86307,4
86307,The price seems to have gone up since I got it though which sucks.,86307,4
86307,The bigger size came in today.,86307,4
86307,"A little bigger in the bust area than I need, but it isn't falling off.",86307,4
86307,Just tie the knot in the middle a little  tighter if you need.,86307,4
86308,Snug across bust line.,86308,4
86309,"Nice detail on a brooch, except that the point end was slightly bent.",86309,4
86309,"I'm not sure if it's only mine, or if anyone else had this issue.",86309,4
86311,Nice ring with good size stones.,86311,4
86311,Actually it is more red than garnet or ruby colored but that's ok.,86311,4
86311,If it were real rubies very few could afford it.,86311,4
86311,"However, I would like the stones to be more garnet dark red.",86311,4
86311,No packaging as it came in a small clear plastic zip bag.,86311,4
86312,you should pick your normal size.,86312,4
86312,no need to get one size larger.,86312,4
86312,maybe get a smaller size for a tighter fit,86312,4
86313,I ordered a small and it fit perfect.,86313,4
86313,The only thing that I was not overly happy with is hot glue was used to connect thr beads to the clasp which is attached to the tie strings.,86313,4
86313,I hope that it holds up which if it does great but it's not very appealing although you can only see it when closeup.,86313,4
86314,A great organizer for passport and (?),86314,4
86314,So handy in the airport lines.,86314,4
86315,Seems to be a quality shirt!,86315,4
86315,"Have washed it a number of times and see no pilling, no shrinking or stretching.",86315,4
86315,It's a great tee shirt!,86315,4
86316,This item arrived earlier than expected.,86316,4
86316,I was very happy about that.,86316,4
86316,These are gorgeous especially for the price.,86316,4
86316,The only thing is that the material seems kind of cheap and I feel like it would fade fast if you wear it all the time but I guess it should be expected with such a low price.,86316,4
86316,I also don't like that one of the bracelets with the charms makes a lot of noise.,86316,4
86316,Other than those few things this item is great.,86316,4
86316,I love how it dresses up a plain outfit and it goes with just about everything.,86316,4
86316,Once these are no good I plan on purchasing again!,86316,4
86317,"Does the trick, keeps the sweaters without buttons or zippers in place.",86317,4
86317,Minus one star because I'm petite and it would work better with one less link in it.,86317,4
86318,As expected but slightly small.,86318,4
86319,"my tall, thin, 19 year old son wore it....It was large but fine for a costume shirt!",86319,4
86320,"they are a gift but look awesome, love the color.",86320,4
86321,Nice ring bought for daughter she loves it that's all that really matters shipping was fast and came as pictured,86321,4
86322,"It is really cute, but runs small.",86322,4
86325,Looks really good on my wife.,86325,4
86325,She's a thick woman in the hips and bust so it was a bit tight.,86325,4
86325,Order 2 sizes larger if you are full figured.,86325,4
86326,"fits as expected,  nice design",86326,4
86327,It's a very good wallet for travel purposes.,86327,4
86327,It'seems a bit long for everyday use.,86327,4
86327,I think a strap would be nice to carry it crossbody style.,86327,4
86327,"The outer pocket will hold some phones, but might be too small for others.",86327,4
86328,This shirt is a great buy and at a great price.,86328,4
86328,"I'm a size 4 in tops so since they didn't have my exact size I went with the small/6 and it fits nicely, a tiny bit big, but that was a given.",86328,4
86328,I really like the gold studs on the sleeve.,86328,4
86328,"Overall, great buy and definitely worth the price!",86328,4
86329,These were cuter than expected and fit nicely over glasses.,86329,4
86330,Really like this blouse.,86330,4
86330,It's easy to launder and it looks nice.,86330,4
86331,Loved it but does run some what small,86331,4
86332,Cute comfy and inexpensive:),86332,4
86333,I like this piece!,86333,4
86333,Just note it is not a choker or even close fitting.,86333,4
86333,It has some length so take note if you are buying for a specific outfit.,86333,4
86333,It seems durable enough (bearing price in mind).,86333,4
86333,The colour is true to what is displayed.,86333,4
86334,To bulky for my taste,86334,4
86335,I like to wear these under a cardigan sweater.,86335,4
86335,The back is very detailed and fits pretty well.,86335,4
86337,"It took almost a month to get after I ordered, but I really like my covers.",86337,4
86337,The colors are vibrant and the rubber plastic is really easy to use to put on and take off of the phone.,86337,4
86337,And it slides into my pocket easily.,86337,4
86338,My daughter normally wears a size 3.,86338,4
86338,We originally ordered a 5 because reviews stated they ran small.,86338,4
86338,The 5 was too small so I reordered a 7.,86338,4
86338,That wasn't much larger than the 5!,86338,4
86338,"So, I just placed another order for a 9.",86338,4
86338,Hopefully that will work because the purple color is just what we were looking for.,86338,4
86340,"Nice little hat - cute and interesting without being obnoxious
Plus confortable to wear",86340,4
86341,Very cute and nice size!,86341,4
86342,I received this within a decent amount of time considering it shipped from China!,86342,4
86342,"I am 5'5"" and wear US Medium.",86342,4
86342,"I had ordered an XL in hopes it would be a bit larger, unfortunately it fits as a US Medium.",86342,4
86345,A little snug on the legs but they are awesome and came super fast!!,86345,4
86346,Momma looks good in this dress.,86346,4
86347,"Because I have to put the buckle on the last hole, the fringe is not centered on my foot.",86347,4
86347,They are still really cute shoes and I will certainly wear them.,86347,4
86348,"Works great for what I need, navy is more of an Oceanside teal than blue, fits snug but doesn't ride too much",86348,4
86349,My children picked this shirt out for their dad's Christmas gift.,86349,4
86349,The kids and my husband loved it.,86349,4
86349,I think the material is a little thin but again we all loved the shirt.,86349,4
86350,i just don't have the body for them but they are great,86350,4
86351,Need to have to altered to fit perfectly but that is expected.,86351,4
86351,From the pictures the beading looks silvery but the actual beads were gold toned.,86351,4
86352,"I usually wear xs or s size , so this dress in xs fits just fine.",86352,4
86353,"Just the skirt the lace at the top it's different from what I was thinking here's a picture for what I mean , other then that I love !",86353,4
86353,", but I like it thank you !",86353,4
86353,Let me know if that was helpful,86353,4
86354,Fits very well good material went back and got the red and the black,86354,4
86355,Dress fit and length was better than expected.,86355,4
86356,The color and style was better than expected.,86356,4
86357,Worked very well on trip,86357,4
86358,Good hat not as thick as i thought the emblem is metal attached to the hat it is way to pricy for the quality will not but again,86358,4
86359,I brought the set for a friend birthday she said that she really like it so I guess it's alright,86359,4
86361,"Nice quality, great fit.",86361,4
86362,Unbelievably nice for price.,86362,4
86363,"cute summer dress, but with lining, too much material for a coverup.",86363,4
86364,the chain that come with it is not to good but ever thing else is made very good.. my son loves it,86364,4
86365,"Nice and sleek, son really likes it",86365,4
86366,"stylish watch, small and petite.",86366,4
86366,put the chains runs a little large.,86366,4
86367,"Not that attractive to wear, but neither is skin cancer.",86367,4
86367,It does the job of protecting my face and neck from summer sun (in addition to my sunscreen).,86367,4
86368,They are great on the foot however not made for thick thighs.,86368,4
86368,They tend to roll down a bit which can be uncomfortable when sitting for a while or annoying when having to keep unrolling them.,86368,4
86369,Love it fit nicely,86369,4
86370,It has so many compartments!,86370,4
86370,More than what I expected.,86370,4
86370,The only con is that it is smaller than I expected.,86370,4
86371,The price is right.,86371,4
86371,One of the straps came loose immediately but it was an easy repair.,86371,4
86371,"Because of the crochet, it's not very easy to get on and off, but once its on, you're sure to feel confident and get lots of compliments.",86371,4
86372,love it love it love it  gonna get a few more.,86372,4
86374,For the size of the hat look itself the band seams smaller then it should be for an xl.,86374,4
86374,Good quality and comfortable.,86374,4
86375,The top is VERY sheer.,86375,4
86375,You definitely have to wear something under it.,86375,4
86375,"The material is cheap and slightly shiny, but I expected that from the price.",86375,4
86376,I was pleasantly surprised by this watch.,86376,4
86376,"I was skeptical about a $7.5 multi-function watch, especially one from the PRC.",86376,4
86376,"While I would not put it in the same category as any of my high quality watches, it would compete favorably at 2-3 times the price.",86376,4
86376,"As with most Chinese watches, the case is thick, but the synthetic rubber case -- much as you would find in a Casio -- lightens the watch weight.",86376,4
86376,"PROS:
Multi-function: analog and digital time, 12 or 24 hr mode, alarm, stopwatch, blue view light for digital display, day and date
Japan movement; accurate time
Attractive display -- two small dials evidently for aesthetic purposes.",86376,4
86376,"One alerts you to 24 vs 12 hour time -- as though you would not realize it; the other has no purpose that I can determine, but it's too small for me to use regardless.",86376,4
86376,"Large buttons (good for us seniors)
Relatively light for the dial and case size
Synthetic rubber case great for outdoor use.",86376,4
86376,"CONS
Thick case -- 1/2 inch
ost savings is evidently gained by loose packing vs. a case or box.",86376,4
86376,It's a keeper for day to day outside and sports use.,86376,4
86377,This product saved my life during those early pregnancy months where I was too bloated to zip my pants but also to small to wear maternity pants yet.,86377,4
86377,It kept my zipper covered and smoothed out the front of my pants.,86377,4
86377,It also lended some support to my back as well.,86377,4
86377,I like that it was very wide.,86377,4
86377,It does have some drawback.,86377,4
86377,"Although it has rubber grippy stuff to hold onto your clothes, it did roll up a lot.",86377,4
86377,"I remember one time, I leaned over my desk and the band rolled up in the back, exposing my backside and undies....my students were hysterical!",86377,4
86378,Great sturdy material and I love the side snaps and the butt ruffles!!,86378,4
86378,The colors are vibrant and gorgeous!!,86378,4
86378,My only downside is that they do run a little small.,86378,4
86378,Size up for sure!,86378,4
86379,"The speaker is good and its durable as well, had it for a while, its great entertainment for campouts, and a conversation starter.",86379,4
86379,It could have more room in the pocket.,86379,4
86380,I guess I over estimated.,86380,4
86382,I thought they were cotton but they are a kind of a shiny material.,86382,4
86382,But they will work.,86382,4
86383,"The bow wasn't secure and came off easy, but a little super glue and it was good as new.",86383,4
86384,It looks good and you will not be disappointing.,86384,4
86385,Not as warm on wood floors as I had hoped.,86385,4
86386,Good for one use.,86386,4
86386,The shirt is good Quality but it shrinks a lot after washing.,86386,4
86386,I guess Yiu only buy it to wear it once the day of the Birthday.,86386,4
86388,Nice hat but did run a bit small.,86388,4
86389,"These are great, and they are long, so she can't pull them off as easily as she does the other socks.",86389,4
86390,"Pros: beautiful color, good quality, interesting design.",86390,4
86390,"Cons: too large for sizes S, XS; can't wear a bra with it because of a very deep cut on the back; looks unflattering on the waist.",86390,4
86390,"I am 5,6/105lb I normally wear sizes S or XS, I ordered this dress in XS, but it is too large in the waist, even though it fits fine in chest and hips.",86390,4
86390,"Overall look is unflattering, makes my body look less curvy than it actually is.",86390,4
86390,"I am sad to return it, as it looks beautiful otherwise.",86390,4
86390,"Order it a size or two smaller, it may work.",86390,4
86392,Loved the style but at the time I really was looking for a hunter green color dress and ordered this one to try in case I didn't like the other green dress I bought.,86392,4
86392,"However, I did feel the sparkle on it was on the cheaper side.....ok for a dinner on a cruise but not for a very elegant type of night.",86392,4
86393,"Am 5.4 fts and 130 pounds and medium fits well apart from the bust area, it's too big.",86393,4
86393,"I wear 36c and this was too huge, i had to get it altered hence the 4 stars.",86393,4
86394,"I like the kilt, I actually wear it to work, but the size suggestion is very clear when it tells you to measure your waist!",86394,4
86394,"Luckily mine fits well and honestly pretty tight, my jeans size is a 29 and I ordered a 30 and it fit very well",86394,4
86396,Nice just a little uncomfortable.,86396,4
86397,I need to lose some weight .........the dress is elegant.....,86397,4
86398,It looks like it does in the picture.,86398,4
86398,"Came packed in a bag, which I don't like.",86398,4
86398,"But I took a steamer to it, so nbd.",86398,4
86398,"My issue is that it is not a cloche, it's a bucket hat.",86398,4
86398,The brim is wide.,86398,4
86398,"It is a little big, but I have a small head.",86398,4
86399,I don't dislike this product I just say is too small.,86399,4
86400,Im very happy with my purchase exactly what I was expecting.,86400,4
86401,Fit a little small- but very nice shirt.,86401,4
86402,Was exactly what I wanted,86402,4
86403,"unfortunately returned, I have this in navy and ordered same size but fit was totally different - I like a little looser fit - but the feel of bamboo made clothing is the best!!!",86403,4
86403,"I own several skirts by this line and absolutely love them, so comfortable

Received re-order of larger size and PERFECT !",86403,4
86403,"these tanks are wonderful to wear all year long, alone, under clothing, as a pajama top.",86403,4
86403,"If you haven't worn clothing by Yala / Bamboo, you're missing out on the softness and wash and wearability of great clothing!",86403,4
86405,The knit is a bit thin but still pretty.,86405,4
86406,I like how it lays on the neck.,86406,4
86407,"It's a bit small for it to lug beach towels and bulky items, but it's pretty sturdy.",86407,4
86407,I'm hoping it will be available in larger sizes.,86407,4
86407,"Even though I knew the size when I ordered it,  I would recommend this bag as an everyday tote.",86407,4
86408,the set is beautiful but arrived broken.,86408,4
86409,Overall I'm happy with the hoodie.,86409,4
86409,If I had noticed an option for a thicker material I would have went for that.,86409,4
86409,This one will only work for mild days.,86409,4
86409,Or to throw on under a larger coat when headed to a spot where a lite hoodie is appropriate.,86409,4
86410,Flexible and warm enough.,86410,4
86410,"My fear is that the elastic waistband will stretch over time, but for now they work as I'd hoped.",86410,4
86411,Works perfect for a substitute wedding ring.,86411,4
86411,Sizing is funny had to order 3 to get the right one.,86411,4
86412,To small for the grandaughter I ordered for.,86412,4
86412,But it worked out ok I gave it to my younger daughter.very pretty.,86412,4
86413,"I'm 5'3 125 , I usually wear small or medium but bought a large and it fit perfect.",86413,4
86413,Came the day it was excepted to arrive.,86413,4
86413,"The skirt is velcrow , and socks where included.",86413,4
86413,The socks I'm wearing in the photo aren't the original ones that came in the package.,86413,4
86414,Got this for my wife for mother's day and she loved it.,86414,4
86414,She said it was very cute and well made.,86414,4
86414,The only drawback for her was that the band was too big for her wrist so it falls off her hand.,86414,4
86414,Would be great if it could be adjustable or came in different sizes.,86414,4
86414,But overall a great product and great price!,86414,4
86415,"INFORMATION:
I'm 5'2"" 32A 112 lbs

FIT:
-Because I'm 32A, this dress doesn't fit me well.",86415,4
86415,The chest area is meant for b cups or higher.,86415,4
86415,So it's extremely loose on me.,86415,4
86415,I can wiggle in it and the straps will fall off!,86415,4
86415,-I tried on a push-up bra and it looked nice but then the bra shows on the back since the back of the dress is really low.,86415,4
86415,-The only thing that's keep this dress on me is the waist.,86415,4
86415,It fits really well and it wraps around my waist nicely.,86415,4
86415,"QUALITY:
This dress' quality is so amazing.",86415,4
86415,It's pretty much like the photo.,86415,4
86415,But the details are a little different.,86415,4
86415,Also the armpit area is higher in real life than the photo.,86415,4
86415,This can make you have a childish frame.,86415,4
86415,It's up to you if you're okay with that.,86415,4
86415,"OVERALL:
If you have boobs then I recommend it.",86415,4
86415,If you're lacking in your chest don't get this!,86415,4
86416,just got it in the mail.,86416,4
86416,"very slightly a lil big, but i like it that way.",86416,4
86416,i don't like rings that feel like they're squeezing my finger.,86416,4
86416,"the PERFECT size i guess would be about 12.5. i can shake my hand, and try to pull it strait off my finger and it doesn't come off easily.",86416,4
86416,"it is nice and shiny like the picture, feels so polished it almost feels slick.",86416,4
86416,i bought this to replace my favorite one i lost.,86416,4
86416,i don't remember what the last one was made of but it was almost impossible to scratch.,86416,4
86416,i even had a berry from welding stick to it and it popped off with no damage to the finish.,86416,4
86416,"IF, IF this ring is the same stuff i expect it will be just as durable.",86416,4
86416,"And at  a fraction of the cost, the last one was also an online purchase, $100.",86416,4
86416,i would have given 5 stars but i don't know how scratch resistant it is yet.,86416,4
86417,Material is not what I was expecting but they fit my newborn and have a decent amount of stretch so I'm sure they'll last awhile.,86417,4
86418,Nice bathing suit and good quality.,86418,4
86420,"Good product, but doesn't fit snug to my face.",86420,4
86420,Stays far allowing a lot of light in.,86420,4
86420,This may work for you...hence four stars!,86420,4
86420,I wish these had fit me better.,86420,4
86421,I bought this for the Renaissance festival  It was as described and fit as expected.,86421,4
86422,I think it was a bit small.,86422,4
86422,"Not significantly small, but if you are in doubt order up.",86422,4
86423,Not as loose sleeves as it looks but still very nice,86423,4
86424,Cute for fun jewelry.,86424,4
86424,Pearls are a little too oversized for my taste but it's a fun bracelet all the same.,86424,4
86425,Unique and nice color.,86425,4
86426,"Very soft, roomy, but not too big.",86426,4
86427,They are nice fit on the fingers and a great quality but they roll down.,86427,4
86429,"Love the hat, but it seems to run very small.",86429,4
86429,I had to return it for fear of dain bramage from blood loss due to constriction.,86429,4
86430,Came very quickly and in a nice box.,86430,4
86430,"Was very excited because I thought I would be able to put my band on while sitting at my mailbox, but that was not the case because it did not come with pins.",86430,4
86430,I have visited their site several times and I could have sworn all of their bands came with quick release pins.,86430,4
86430,This band came with no pins and does not have the ability to place quick release pins inside.,86430,4
86430,Not happy with that considering the price I paid for it.,86430,4
86430,I bought a band for $0.67 on AliExpress and got pins to go with it even though I didn't think I'd get any.,86430,4
86430,"Other than that, beautiful quality and vivid colors.",86430,4
86430,I think I will love the band once I put it on my Huawei Watch.,86430,4
86431,Just a little tight around the hips....my personal problem.,86431,4
86433,The price is very worth for buy,86433,4
86434,Was super excited when I got mine.,86434,4
86434,The trying-on went all well except that it was drowning me a bit.,86434,4
86434,"A little heart broken seeing that I needed it for some events next week... but oh well, it is what it is.",86434,4
86434,Guess I'll get it replaced for a smaller size.,86434,4
86434,"All in all, 100 on the design and material.",86434,4
86435,Runs small so go a size up if you choose to purchase.,86435,4
86436,Bought for my daughter to wear to her sister's wedding.,86436,4
86437,I like the crochet detailing along the bottom.,86437,4
86437,"It is a bit see-through, but it's ok, as I would already wear a tank top underneath to eliminate tummy/midriff exposure in general.",86437,4
86437,"If you lift up your arms, you do run the risk of more than a little midriff getting shown.",86437,4
86437,"I'm 5'7"" and weigh around 165.",86437,4
86437,I did not find it tight or constricting at all.,86437,4
86437,(Ordered the xl to make sure I had lots of room.,86437,4
86437,I think a large would have been too tight in the arms.),86437,4
86437,"Purchased for a quick coverup overtop of my bathing suit, I thinkit will do that job well.",86437,4
86439,This is a great lightweight hat that covers both the face and back of the neck.,86439,4
86439,"I bought this because my nephew has one and it works well at the beach, this fits my little one well.",86439,4
86440,"These leggings were really baggy in areas, like the crotch.",86440,4
86440,And the yellow batman logos are see through in some areas.,86440,4
86441,"I'm 5'6"" and it ran long in the waste, but I'm short wasted with long legs.",86441,4
86441,Wore it with shorts and have worn it to yoga.,86441,4
86442,Lovely and the very item I was looking to purchase .,86442,4
86443,"The fit isn't too bad,  but the bottoms are a bit small and the top a bit large.",86443,4
86444,Fits great; will probably buy more in future,86444,4
86446,but didn't know there was a flap in the front and back so if you do get the black one make sure you have black pair of panties or boy shorts because the wind will easily show everything front and back!!,86446,4
86446,So maybe I'll just sew the sides so my butt doesn't show,86446,4
86447,"I think the perameters of the insole was 12-13.5, and my size is 13",86447,4
86448,"I ordered a large (previously I was an XL now I'm more of a L), and based off of the reviews I read, the hoodie was bigger than I had imagined since people mainly said size up one or two sizes.",86448,4
86448,"The sleeves are slim- slimmer than I've ever seen on a hoodie/sweatshirt, so it takes manoeuvring to pull it off.",86448,4
86448,"But, the body was totally fine for me and didn't fit snug at all.",86448,4
86448,"However, if you like your hoodies baggy, you should size up one or two.",86448,4
86448,"Now, two of the big letters on the back didn't have perfect edges, i.e., I could tell there had been problems with the application.",86448,4
86448,"The ends of the drawstring don't have anything to stop them from unraveling, which is undesirable and I'll have to fix.",86448,4
86448,"Though, I worry about damaging even just with regular wear since it's not sturdy enough to be put in a washer or dryer.",86448,4
86449,My son loves his shoes.,86449,4
86449,They fit good and are built pretty good.,86449,4
86449,Update: After a week one of the shoes quit working.,86449,4
86449,"You have to squeeze the bottom sole of the shoe and it will pop on, but it won't stay on, pressure to the bottom when walking makes it come on and off.",86449,4
86449,I believe there's a short in the bulb or something.,86449,4
86449,So all in all for 30$ it's worth it.,86449,4
86449,The shoe itself is pretty cool and is holding up pretty good.,86449,4
86449,I would prefer laces for older kids it's not too cute with all the straps.,86449,4
86449,If they could tweak the LEDs in them to work better and longer they would be a five star.,86449,4
86450,This outfit is huge!,86450,4
86450,My daughter who is 2 and usually wears 18month outfits is swimming in this.,86450,4
86450,May be able to wear in a year or so.,86450,4
86450,Still a very cute outfit just sad she has to wait so long to wear it.,86450,4
86451,"The only thing I don't like about this purse is the zipper you have to unzip it from side to side, I prefer top zippers but other then that it is very nice for a inexpensive purse.",86451,4
86454,Looks very sexy and it fits to size.,86454,4
86454,I'm a large but I bought an x-large just to be on the safe side and it fits perfect.,86454,4
86454,Material is very thin and I'm not sure if it's swim material but definitely very cute,86454,4
86455,It fit just right.,86455,4
86455,The same suit was  more expensive on another site,86455,4
86456,"Some stitching was coming loose when we opened the packet, but other than that it's  very nice and fits well.",86456,4
86457,"Material is pretty thin & cheap, like a cheap swimsuit.",86457,4
86457,"But for the price and shipping time, it's fine for casual / party use.",86457,4
86458,"Super cute, made out of wire for the head, slightly shocked to find out how many compliments you get.",86458,4
86459,I love my boots!,86459,4
86460,Everyone said this ran small.,86460,4
86460,"I am 5'3, 160lbs and bought a medium.",86460,4
86460,It is a tiny bit small but I think if I lose 5lns it will fit perfectly.,86460,4
86460,I think a large would be too big.,86460,4
86462,Easy to walk in and comfortable.,86462,4
86463,"The wife is using it, but only very little.",86463,4
86464,"Fits really good, but I wouldn't wear it as a bathing suit because the is zero lining or support but that's ok because I bought it to wear as a body suit so I planned on wearing a bra with it anyways.",86464,4
86465,Nice item - nice price...my husband love it.,86465,4
86466,My daughter loved this.,86466,4
86466,She needed to dress up and tgthr with a skirt she already had this completed the leopard look.,86466,4
86467,"Vans are fine, shipped quickly.",86467,4
86468,This worked very well to give my dress a small lift.,86468,4
86468,I took out the metal rings for a more natura look and fit!,86468,4
86469,The cape runs extremely!,86469,4
86469,It is a beautiful  design.,86469,4
86469,Had it not run soooooo small it would be perfect.,86469,4
86469,"I would recommend
you go up two to three sizes  from your normal size if you plan on ordering this cape.",86469,4
86470,I love the style and ease.,86470,4
86470,My son will wear this to a wedding but its a tad on the big side and we got the smallest one available.,86470,4
86470,Hoping he puts a few pounds on before the wedding but soft material and shipped fast.,86470,4
86471,This shirt is very soft and cute.,86471,4
86471,Better material than I expected.,86471,4
86471,The large fits my 38DDs without a problem.,86471,4
86472,"Pants are great, however, the waist could use an elastic band to keep them from slipping down.",86472,4
86473,Gum rubber sole just what I was looking for.,86473,4
86473,Lots of toe room.,86473,4
86474,LaGaksta is my new favorite bag company!!!,86474,4
86474,High quality leather even the straps!,86474,4
86474,I like to have small bags that just hold what I need to go out!,86474,4
86474,These fit the bill perfectly!,86474,4
86476,"this is a nice one, better  quality than the coofandy",86476,4
86477,"Great shoes to protect kids feet from hot sand, or broken glass at the beach",86477,4
86478,Scarf pin was very nice.,86478,4
86478,Have worn it already.,86478,4
86478,"It was packaged well, arrived as stated and I would order a similar item in the future without concern.",86478,4
86479,But the chain is way too short(and I don't have dumbo ears which is why it's gettin 4 stars instead of the 5 I would've given lol)..I took off the chain and replaced it with a short bracelet.,86479,4
86479,Would still purchase again :),86479,4
86480,I can do without the panties only because the style is not a good match for my curves.,86480,4
86480,The bustier it comes with had me hooked instantly.,86480,4
86480,I slept in it peacefully.,86480,4
86480,It is absolutely perfect.,86480,4
86480,I could not be happier with this little number here.,86480,4
86480,"In fact, I plan to get the white and red sets as well.",86480,4
86480,Your girls will be smiling back at you for this one ladies!,86480,4
86481,They run very small but once you get the right size they are comfortable.,86481,4
86481,They have a lot of pockets which is nice.,86481,4
86482,This is what I wanted,86482,4
86483,They are little snug around the hips and legs than I thought.,86483,4
86483,But it fits the package area perfectly and I am nicely endowed.,86483,4
86483,Quality is very good in terms of fabric.,86483,4
86484,They look great and others have complimented me on them.,86484,4
86484,they are not going to last long as the price indicates but that is expected.,86484,4
86485,It is a  beautiful piece but if you plan to put your iPhone plus there doesn't work,86485,4
86486,"Very cute, looked just like the pictures.",86486,4
86486,"I knew these were going to be small because they are from Chins, but I'm still happy with the purchase.",86486,4
86486,"I'm older, so for younger women these will probably fit perfectly.",86486,4
86487,High quality fabric fits my 5 year old perfectly.,86487,4
86488,I liked it but it was a bit on the small size.,86488,4
86488,"I loved the see through crochet, but the down side it that it riped really fast, only after a few times of putting it on.",86488,4
86488,"Apart from that, it was nice to at least wear it a few times.",86488,4
86488,But I would not buy again.,86488,4
86488,It's a waste of money to buy something that will ripe after few times of wearing it.,86488,4
86489,The bottoms are actually smaller than in the picture.,86489,4
86489,"I am a very fit 5'2, 35-25-35 framed woman 115 lbs.",86489,4
86489,"I was very self conscience wearing to beach here in Chicago, but had a cocktail and was fine.",86489,4
86489,there is less material on the back of the bottoms than pictured.,86489,4
86490,Just a little clunky looking but overall really nice.,86490,4
86490,I wear it all the time.,86490,4
86490,"Also I really like that it came with an extra string of scrap turquoise beads, I was able to add a clasp and turn it into a simple bracelet.",86490,4
86491,I wish they were a liitle more scratch resistant.,86491,4
86492,"They look good, are sturdy and provide a nice, clear view.",86492,4
86493,Waist is snag but legs are comfortably loose as expected.,86493,4
86494,The costume was ok...,86494,4
86494,"I ordered a Medium, but fits like a Large.",86494,4
86494,I had to fix some of the strings because it wasn't pulled out correctly.,86494,4
86494,Overall an ok product.,86494,4
86495,Good material top fit a bit snug but if I would have went for a size but neither would have fit overall good purchase for the price,86495,4
86497,The lenses are darker than they appear in the picture.,86497,4
86497,The temple pieces seem shorter than the described 145 mm length.,86497,4
86497,They are light weight but seem durable.,86497,4
86498,"Cute shirt, but too big.",86498,4
86498,"After reading the reviews I ordered a large, when I'm typically a small.",86498,4
86498,"I wanted the shirt baggy, but it's a little too wide on the bottom.",86498,4
86498,"If I were to order again I'd go a size smaller, but I'm pleased with the shirt for the amount I paid.",86498,4
86499,"Great ha,t we need to see more Trump stuff out there!",86499,4
86500,I get so many compliments on this.,86500,4
86500,It is incredibly difficult to remove my driver's license from the slot if it's pushed all the way inso I always keep it poking out for easy access.,86500,4
86500,"Also, some of the credit card holders are really tight and you cannot put regular sized cards there.",86500,4
86500,"Overall, LOVE this wallet even with these few flaws.",86500,4
86501,My roommate loved this as his gift!,86501,4
86503,"Love that dress, but had to return it due to printing.",86503,4
86503,I was not satisfied how it lined at the back.,86503,4
86503,But the quality is good.,86503,4
86504,It does run very small.tjpugh.,86504,4
86504,"I normally wear a Large, 10-12, 38D, and I ordered and xl cause I read it runs small and this is very snug even at an xl.",86504,4
86504,"However, the material drapes in the front so you don't see the snug fit so much in the front.",86504,4
86504,Now you do see it in the back for a few reasons.,86504,4
86504,"It has no give, and it is totally sheer.",86504,4
86504,I will for sure be wearing a tank under this.,86504,4
86504,The front panel is also sheer so you see skin for sure.,86504,4
86504,"However, it fits great in the armpits and the length is perfect I really like this a lot.",86504,4
86506,"Son is 12 but 5'7"".",86506,4
86507,Love this bathing suit!!,86507,4
86507,"I bought a medium and in Victoria secret I wear a small top and medium bottoms, medium bottoms are always a little too small but large is too big so I'll just have to do lol and the medium top fits perfectly.",86507,4
86507,So I'd say it runs a little small.,86507,4
86507,Probably in your best interest to get a size bigger.,86507,4
86507,"But other than that, I love it!",86507,4
86507,"Padding is great, good quality.",86507,4
86507,Definitely my bathing suit of the summer.,86507,4
86508,I like that the piece can go with jeans or pencil skirt for work.,86508,4
86508,I love houndstooth so that's attractive to me.,86508,4
86508,The only thing that was detracting was it needs a little more stretch.,86508,4
86508,Order a size larger than you wear at least.,86508,4
86509,This is a great fit and it's official.,86509,4
86509,I ordered another from amazon and it was not as expected.,86509,4
86509,"With that said, I am more petite and Asian style clothing fits me very well.",86509,4
86509,So the one size fits all is for a smaller -medium build or a  juniors one site fits all.,86509,4
86509,Nice and warm too,86509,4
86510,"Nice, fits everything just fine.",86510,4
86511,I love this jumpsuit!,86511,4
86511,"It does bunch a little in the crotch, but it fit nicely!",86511,4
86511,Really dresses up with a nice pair of heels!,86511,4
86511,Came way sooner than expected!,86511,4
86513,This is cute and comfortable.,86513,4
86514,I purchased two of these shirts in different colors.,86514,4
86514,They fit very well and are cut generously so they hang properly.,86514,4
86514,The collar is right out of the 70's (large) but I use a couple of tab pins to hold it as if it were a button down.,86514,4
86514,Two people out in public have commented that they like the shirt.,86514,4
86515,The leash is softer than I thought it would be and the perfect color pink.,86515,4
86515,Very well made and perfect for my dog who likes to pull.,86515,4
86516,So far I haven't got beat up yet,86516,4
86518,I loved this wig and received so many compliments!,86518,4
86518,"The reason for the 4 stars was that I had to brush out some of the back combing and trim some of the hair at the base - it looked like when they sewed the hair in they didn't do it right so where the part is I had 1/4"" to 1/2"" of hair sticking out (think of when a 4 year old decides it's a good idea to cut there own bangs, it looked a little like that)",86518,4
86519,"Comfortable, a bit large at first, but after many washings, fits well.",86519,4
86521,"Great hats, tight around the ears which I need, could afford to be a bit longer in the back though.",86521,4
86522,"The material is a little too flexible so when you squeeze to open, the purse tens to fold up rather than pop open.",86522,4
86522,"I've used this type before and the material was a little firmer, which meant you could open it easily with one hand and then tip the change out into your other hand.",86522,4
86522,"With this one, you have to dig in with fingers which is a less convenient.",86522,4
86523,Received as described and in a timely manner.,86523,4
86524,The white sleeve shirt does not come with the costume.,86524,4
86525,Smaller than expected but overall good quality shirt.,86525,4
86525,Will order up next time.,86525,4
86526,"Nice and affordable, didn't take too long to ship/arrive but there is one downside (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).",86526,4
86526,The underside fabric was falling apart a bit when I got it.,86526,4
86526,"Nothing a bit of glue or something won't fix and it isn't that noticeable luckily, but it was still a bit of a bummer.",86526,4
86527,This is a great dress!,86527,4
86527,There was excellent communication about the sizing from the beginning.,86527,4
86527,"The dress in this thumbnail is different than the dress I purchased, but the dress was well made & fit as expected.",86527,4
86527,The only problem I had with it is that I ordered Ivory & the dress looks very WHITE to me.,86527,4
86527,"The invoice says ivory, yet it is not the color I need for my wedding.",86527,4
86527,"As long as the return process goes smoothly, I would absolutely recommend shopping with this company!",86527,4
86528,My ears are old so they hung down a little in the back on my ears so I gave them to my daughter in law and she loves them.,86528,4
86529,Beautiful and good quality.,86529,4
86530,"The bill almost looks black in the pictures, but it's actually navy.",86530,4
86531,It look good but it was bigger than I thought.,86531,4
86531,I bought this as gift.,86531,4
86531,I hope its durable.,86531,4
86532,Fyi those buttons down the back is actually a zipper!,86532,4
86532,Did not realize that when I bought it.,86532,4
86533,"GREAT material, great colors, I'm a small and it was a little loose on my waist, wish they were tighter- but I still wear them!",86533,4
86535,"Runs just a bit small, but very sexy!",86535,4
86537,Delivery was a day late.,86537,4
86537,How ever the tool itself works great.,86537,4
86537,Before I was using paper clips on one watch band and it took me about an hour to remove two links.,86537,4
86537,Needed to use three paper clips.,86537,4
86537,Pushing the pin with the paper clip also makes a sore spot on the finger due to the difficulty of trying to push the pin out.,86537,4
86537,Now that I have this little tool I can remove a link and put the band back together in much less time.,86537,4
86537,Maybe about 5 minutes.,86537,4
86537,One improvement I can see is to have different size pins available.,86537,4
86537,The other improvement it could use is to have a straight pin.,86537,4
86537,Mines is slightly crooked.,86537,4
86537,I can see the pin wiggling when turning the screw.,86537,4
86537,Minus a star for that.,86537,4
86537,It's a very fair price for this little tool.,86537,4
86538,I ordered the 2t/3t and the waist was a bit snug for my 25 month old.,86538,4
86538,He's normally a 3t in bottoms.,86538,4
86538,I wasn't sure if the next size up 4t/5t would be too big.,86538,4
86538,They will work for now.,86538,4
86542,if you have big boobs don't buy it,86542,4
86544,Good Christmas gift for a Raiders fan.,86544,4
86545,Bought this for my sister she loved it,86545,4
86546,New favorite work pants,86546,4
86547,It was really cute on the child,86547,4
86548,"I am 5'2"" and 140lbs and the S fits me perfectly.",86548,4
86548,"I would be comfortable wearing this dress out to a social occasion as-is, but it is a little on a short side for business wear; I will pair with tights and boots to wear to work.",86548,4
86548,"The material is thin and is made from an odd polyester blend, so it is slick and easily wrinkled as noted in other reviews.",86548,4
86548,"It is loose and boxy and probably not a terribly flattering cut for everyone, but it looks cute on me as long as I use a belt to define my waist.",86548,4
86548,"Very hit or miss dress, but I like it.",86548,4
86549,Fits my curves great.,86549,4
86549,I am 5'3 and about 150lbs so I ordered a medium and it stretches.,86549,4
86549,My only complaint is that the straps aren't pre-tied and as thick as the photo.,86549,4
86550,The quality of the fabric is ok but no the best.,86550,4
86551,These sunglasses are cute and look adorable on!,86551,4
86551,The lenses get scratched up very easily so be very careful about where you lay your sunglasses down.,86551,4
86552,I got this watch because it looks difference.,86552,4
86552,The watch is heavy because is made of stainless steel as advertise.,86552,4
86552,"Since this is a bracelet watch and I'm skinny, it looks to big for me and personally I don't like the watch to be lose.",86552,4
86552,I'm gonna have to adjust/remove a section from both side of the belt to make it tight.,86552,4
86552,"For a big guy, this watch is perfect, no adjustment necessary.",86552,4
86552,"Now, it will take you about a week to learn how to read the watch and get use to it.",86552,4
86552,"It will take you about 5 seconds to read the time and that is because the watch is always have the light off, which is good since save battery.",86552,4
86553,Really cute and the shirt is nice and soft,86553,4
86555,Love the quality of this skirt.,86555,4
86555,It is a bit snug on me.,86555,4
86555,I bought a medium dress from gown town and it fit like a glove.,86555,4
86555,Apparently my hips are wider than i thought.,86555,4
86555,I think it will be perfect if i drop a few pounds.,86555,4
86556,"I really like these earrings, although since it's too difficult for me to put on the other half to it (the moon-shaped part) I only wear the stars alone.",86556,4
86556,"It feels a little weird wearing it with the other half like there's not enough room for the earring back to keep it all in place and it seems to hang a little low even on the highest loop, but that may just be me.",86556,4
86556,"A lot of people don't like the color, but since I am (probably) slightly blue-green colorblind (some green shades appear blue to me) my rating isn't judged by it.",86556,4
86556,"To me the stars appear blue and so do the dots but with maybe the teenyest hint of green, but don't trust me on that since I might see it wrong.",86556,4
86556,"Either way, I like the color the way it is!",86556,4
86556,:) Very nice for the price I think.,86556,4
86557,YES this shirt runs small (as stated) BUT it's still a very good quality shirt.,86557,4
86557,"I'm 5'2"" about 140lbs and I ordered the XL and it JUST fits (if I dropped a few pounds, it would be perfect).",86557,4
86557,"The shirt is very light, thin and see through but it's not cheap looking.",86557,4
86557,Can wear with anything and look cute.,86557,4
86559,"Here is my experience from ordering dresses for Men and Women:

The issue with all these ""Maid In china"" nice women and men dress are that they are cut specifically for thin and cut Asian population.",86559,4
86559,"Therefore , even-Thu when western buyers  order two or three size larger then their size,it still not fit correctly.",86559,4
86559,Italian correct these issue around 30-35 years ago.,86559,4
86559,I advice the seller to communicate this issue to their manufacturing designers to compliantly resigned their sizing from Chines to Western continents or they will lose their western buyers busyness.,86559,4
86559,I gave them three starts because the design and cut  is nice on a thin women.,86559,4
86559,"I hope that helped,
I got my money refunded.",86559,4
86560,Slim and nice !,86560,4
86561,Alittle big for a 7.5.,86561,4
86562,I love the detail of this.,86562,4
86562,But it is rather big and heavy.,86562,4
86562,Not something I could wear all day but definitely something I will wear.,86562,4
86563,They are very difficult to put in.,86563,4
86563,The quality is just fine.,86563,4
86565,They fit fairly well and have a nice stretch to them.,86565,4
86565,"I just wish they would have been able to go up to my thighs without rolling back down to my knees, but I bought them expecting this to possibly happen; so I don't mind it lol.",86565,4
86566,Fabric a little thin.,86566,4
86566,I realized I prefer V neck so I gave these away.,86566,4
86567,Very pretty and well made but it runs extremely small.,86567,4
86568,I accidentally received a size large.,86568,4
86568,I'm glad I did as it runs very small.,86568,4
86568,I never wear a large.,86568,4
86568,But it worked out.,86568,4
86568,I wish there was more colors in this shirt.,86568,4
86568,I get a lot of compliments.,86568,4
86570,Dress is much longer than it should be for the size it is.,86570,4
86570,Hopefully in a year or 2 it will fit I guess.,86570,4
86571,Nice Shorts but way too big in the legs.,86571,4
86572,Great length and super comfy.,86572,4
86572,"My only issue with it is that I wish it wasn't shear at all, material slightly too thin which has a see through quality.",86572,4
86572,I just wear a tank underneath but would have ordered more if was not shear at all.,86572,4
86572,Still a good product though :),86572,4
86573,"I could not say much, I bought it for a gift for my nephew, I saw it put and it fit very well, the material of good quality and well done",86573,4
86574,its bit smaller for the size but it looks good.,86574,4
86575,Bought this for my grandson to wear to a Star Wars thing.,86575,4
86575,He's happy so I'm happy.,86575,4
86575,Just wish it had been a little bit better quality for the price but it's okay!,86575,4
86576,Very good for little ones who do not like slimy mud and sand!!,86576,4
86577,I'm a big guy and this fits pretty well and the tie is long enough to go around twice very easily.,86577,4
86577,Didn't think I would like a black apron but it actually stays pretty clean.,86577,4
86577,Pocket is handy for thermometer.,86577,4
86578,The skirt is really nice.,86578,4
86578,Exactly what I thought just way too big.,86578,4
86578,My daughter is 9 and it may fit her in a year or two.,86578,4
86578,We'll keep it until she grows into it.,86578,4
86578,Everyone needs a simple black skirt.,86578,4
86578,I would say the size is probably more like a 12-16.,86578,4
86578,Not a size 7.,86578,4
86579,They are adorable a little narrow but not bad.,86579,4
86579,If the charge lasted longer I'd give it 5 stars.,86579,4
86579,"You do need to be kinda careful, I don't see the light part lasting really long,  but the shoe itself is cute and both my boys said they are comfy.",86579,4
86580,I had not had a 2 piece in years!,86580,4
86581,I think I may have ordered a size too small..I had a baby so size probably changes......but I love the support and the way the band stays put and doesn't ride up when moving.,86581,4
86582,Nice set of nipple rings.,86582,4
86583,Fits well & color matches picture.,86583,4
86583,The buttons are very loose.,86583,4
86583,Need additional sewing to tighten them.,86583,4
86584,"Great little prop, but the lights didn't work.",86584,4
86584,Will have to rewire myself.,86584,4
86585,"Ummmm unless the model is iddy biddy tiny or I'm a whale, this scarf is not big like this, it is long, it is not that wide.... i like it and will use it, but it was not what I was expecting!",86585,4
86586,"The socks were great, but the sizes were odd.",86586,4
86586,All different and a few pairs were child size almost.,86586,4
86587,"Not as fantastical as the jeans, but I'm still pretty jazzed.",86587,4
86588,"It could use a better strap, other than that it's pretty good",86588,4
86589,"This dress feels like a plastic table cloth like another customer has mentioned, but I actually liked it.",86589,4
86589,I wore in on a vacation to Mexico and the dress was perfect for the +80 degrees and humid weather.,86589,4
86589,The color of the design was not as vibrant as pictured.,86589,4
86589,"I actually came back to order another dress in a different design or color and after seeing all the bad reviews, I had to share my positive review.",86589,4
86589,It's not as bad ladies!,86589,4
86590,"A bit heavy, but feels ok to wear all the time, which is what I was looking for.",86590,4
86591,"The jewelry looks exactly like the picture and it's absolutely beautiful, however it's much smaller than the description makes it seem.",86591,4
86591,It's also difficult to get the bead back in.,86591,4
86591,But otherwise it's totally worth it.,86591,4
86592,I purchased a large.,86592,4
86592,I wear size 10.,86592,4
86592,I thought the large could be roomier especially the pants.,86592,4
86592,otherwise the quality is good.,86592,4
86593,I am still.wearing after 1mnth as I feel a big difference when I wear it.,86593,4
86593,It helps hold everything in causing less pulling and my incision and area around that is tender is less sensitive when wearing them.,86593,4
86593,Only problem I have had is if using pads with wings have trouble getting wings to stick and stay in place.,86593,4
86594,on the large side so great for towels and everything else.,86594,4
86595,Kinda confusing but you figure it out,86595,4
86596,Super soft but runs large!,86596,4
86597,This is a very cute dress.,86597,4
86597,"I'm 5'2 and ordered a small, if there were an extra small I would've ordered that one.",86597,4
86597,It's slightly large on the top just because I have very small boobs and dresses have a hard time fitting well to both my chest and waist.,86597,4
86597,"It's not overly long but doesn't show my rear if I bend a little or when I'm sitting, good coverage.",86597,4
86597,You will need a nude/white bra or a white tank top to wear with it for the top is see through with brighter colors.,86597,4
86597,"Its much more see through in the back , in the front you can hardly notice what color bra you're wearing.",86597,4
86597,The band comes up just at my belly button and is elastic so it hugs you just right.,86597,4
86597,I like this dress enough to get it hemmed by a friend.,86597,4
86597,I only take off the one star because of the chest part but that is nothing on the dress and is completely me.,86597,4
86598,"Bc the skirt is elastic around the waist, I have to pull it around the top portion of my tummy for it to fasten correctly.",86598,4
86598,THe under slip is to short but no one will see that.,86598,4
86599,The one I ordered was supposed to be blue but the one I received was black.,86599,4
86600,"Very cute, and fit my lip perfectly.",86600,4
86601,I'm in my first trimester and already having trouble with pants fitting.,86601,4
86601,This has been a lifesaver!,86601,4
86601,I'm able to leave my pants unbuttoned and double this over to keep everything secure and fairly smooth.,86601,4
86601,I do wish the silicone strip was wider.,86601,4
86601,"The back side keeps rolling / sliding up, so I am constantly pulling it up to fix it.",86601,4
86601,But at least things in front are secure.,86601,4
86601,Wish grey was available in size 2.,86601,4
86601,"Also to note: I did not notice any strange chemical smells with mine, whereas other reviews seem to report this.",86601,4
86601,Maybe this issue has been fixed?,86601,4
86601,Or maybe I got lucky?,86601,4
86602,"Very cute, leg warmers aren't rave fluffies...",86602,4
86602,They don't fit over shoes,86602,4
86603,This is a little heavier than I thought.,86603,4
86603,Feels a little scratching.,86603,4
86603,Feels like a winter sweater  but I was thinking it would be more like a summer cover up.,86603,4
86603,Still like it a lot though.,86603,4
86603,I am normally a small/ medium and the medium fits perfect.,86603,4
86603,Very true to the color shown.,86603,4
86604,Overall I'm pleased with the product.,86604,4
86604,"They're smooth, comfortable, the right size, though maybe the flares are a bit big- but these are my first set of double flare plugs, so what do I know?",86604,4
86604,Anyways my problem comes with the packaging.,86604,4
86604,They were sent in a combined order with two other heavier objects and when the (too large) box got to me one half of the box was crushed.,86604,4
86604,"Because these little guys were left to roll around without anymore protection than a ziplock bag, the amethyst set was rendered unwearable due to chips and one shattering in half.",86604,4
86604,Now I'm not really sure what to do!,86604,4
86604,I was really looking forward to that pair and now I can't even use them.,86604,4
86605,I think its really cute and sexy!,86605,4
86605,"The bottom is a little loose around the waist, but other than that its perfect!",86605,4
86606,A little looser than I thought they would be.,86606,4
86607,Tried them on and they aren't as see through as a lot of other leggings out there!,86607,4
86608,Very functional with multiple storage pockets.,86608,4
86609,"They are thinner socks, but my boyfriend loved his present :D He is a size 8 in men's shoes & they fit him great, but I would imagine they would be snug on a larger foot.",86609,4
86610,My three year old loves these boots!,86610,4
86610,He insists on wearing them all the time.,86610,4
86610,Rain or shine he wants them on!,86610,4
86610,I did buy them big so he can wear them for a while.,86610,4
86610,"They are big right now but that doesn't seem to bother him at all, he still loves them.",86610,4
86611,"It is big enough to fit papers and a notebook or two for work along with my lunch, gloves, wallet, etc.",86611,4
86611,but still feels like a purse.,86611,4
86611,The material is perfect because it doesn't look plasticky but won't get destroyed like leather.,86611,4
86611,I do wish it had another pocket or two.,86611,4
86611,Inside there is only one small zipper pocket.,86611,4
86611,When mine arrived I was a little skeptical about the clasp on the shoulder strap.,86611,4
86611,"Sure enough, it broke less than five minutes into my walking commute.",86611,4
86611,"Thankfully, I contacted the seller and received a replacement strap.",86611,4
86611,The clasp is a little different and has been great so far.,86611,4
86612,"It fits a tad bit small, but overall it snatched every inch in perfectly.",86612,4
86612,Would rate five stars if it was a little bigger !,86612,4
86613,Cute and super soft.,86613,4
86613,Sadly I had to return it because it was too small but if it fit I would have kept it for sure.,86613,4
86614,Nice material and provides adequate warmth.,86614,4
86616,I like this little hat.,86616,4
86616,It appears to be of good quality and has a nice wide brim.,86616,4
86616,"Another big pro is it, it is adjustable so my little can use it for quite some time.",86616,4
86616,The grey color is also nice :),86616,4
86618,It would be awesome if I had less cards.,86618,4
86618,"I have 6 credit cards(and several other cards: insurance, blood donor, debit) and when I put cards in the pockets on top it makes it hard to get to any of the cards in the pockets underneath the cards on top because it is so tight.",86618,4
86618,Seems to be made of good materials and the stitching looks secure.,86618,4
86618,Overall it is a good wallet and worth the money.,86618,4
86618,The shipping was high for the size and weight of the item and the length of time it took to deliver.,86618,4
86619,These Sandals are cute.,86619,4
86619,"they are about 1/2""  size to big.",86619,4
86619,But cute even with the extra toe.,86619,4
86619,I think they came in to big because  they are not made in America and China is struggling to match American sizes.,86619,4
86619,Eventually companies that care will get it right.,86619,4
86619,If I could get them in black I would.,86619,4
86619,Be care when ordering from companies in Chine.,86619,4
86619,"Your shoes will be slightly too big or too small, too narrow or to wide.",86619,4
86619,Luckily by not much.,86619,4
86619,Rarely products come in the right size and width.,86619,4
86619,Too me the price of these shoes fits the quality.,86619,4
86620,Look well made and very stylish,86620,4
86621,"As fake blood goes, this product worked well.",86621,4
86622,These are great sunglasses for the price point.,86622,4
86622,Love that they include a nice case and cloth.,86622,4
86623,"Good ring, especially for the price.",86623,4
86623,Very light weight and it's more durable than it appears.,86623,4
86623,I've worn mine for a few months now and no mars or significant scratches.,86623,4
86624,"Cover up to be used on board a cruise, looks like it will work well for me and it's light weight and easy to pack.",86624,4
86625,Too big for my wrists and no way to adjust.,86625,4
86626,make sure you go 2 sizes larger than what you normally wear it runs really small,86626,4
86627,LOVE how it looks.,86627,4
86627,"Everytime i wear them, i feel like a celebrity Hahaha",86627,4
86629,"Beautiful, but keep in mind that the color of the item you receive may be different.",86629,4
86629,Mine was much more blue than the green stone pictured.,86629,4
86630,"I purchased a large for a Halloween costume expecting it to probably be a bit baggy on me, but worried that a medium may have been too small after seeing some of the pictures others have posted (I'm typically a medium in clothing).",86630,4
86630,"I think I could have gotten away with a medium, but the large worked perfectly fine as a costume piece.",86630,4
86630,It's a very simple flapper costume but I accessorized well and got a lot of compliments!,86630,4
86630,"The material is cheap, but that didn't really bother me at all, as I wasn't going for authenticity.",86630,4
86631,"this is nice just a little big for my hands , look just like the pic",86631,4
86632,The bottom fits nicely but the top has no support.,86632,4
86633,"bit small, ordered a black one in next larger size",86633,4
86634,"It's ok I have seen the same product on my trips to Hong Kong, at least in Hong Kong I could pick up the same item in Macao city , just a ferryboat ride across from City, only their I could find for 10 Hong Kong dollars about $3 US.",86634,4
86634,Leather smells funny not like real leather smell.,86634,4
86634,Does not feel the same eather.,86634,4
86634,But it is what is is.,86634,4
86634,You want the real deal be prepaired to pay a lot more than $15 US.,86634,4
86634,Now buyer beware Amazon now has alot of Chinise venders and alot of products being sent direct from China.,86634,4
86635,"US Large is closer to a US Medium, still fits me though.",86635,4
86636,Works great for someone that needs that much arch,86636,4
86637,The shoes is cute.,86637,4
86637,But it fit small.,86637,4
86637,I tired to return it but to ship it back was $20 dollars.,86637,4
86637,So I kept it and regifted it.,86637,4
86638,wasn't exactly the color I ordered.,86638,4
86638,But still cute nonetheless.,86638,4
86639,I wear a size 2xl and I bought a 3x.,86639,4
86639,"It fits well in the waist but the thighs were tight, I guess that is the slimming aspect of it.",86639,4
86639,I wore it to a party underneath jeggings and one of my coworkers said wow I didn't realize you had such a big butt lol.,86639,4
86639,"That's the aim right..Overall it's a great item for the price, it does lift your butt and offers tummy control.",86639,4
86641,bigger than i imagined,86641,4
86642,The suit doesn't fit QUITE as I expected it to...,86642,4
86642,I got a small and the bottoms are just a tad too big and the top a tad too small.,86642,4
86642,I can wear it just fine but be aware it probably won't fit you perfectly.,86642,4
86642,The material however is wonderful and it looks lovely on!,86642,4
86643,"Excellent wallet and the size I was hoping for, my only gripe is i'd have rather'd a larger 'middle' section than two pockets on each side.",86643,4
86643,Cash comically does not fit in here.,86643,4
86644,"Given how inexpensive, or downright cheap, the watch was it works pretty well.",86644,4
86644,The watch is quartz accurate and my only complaint is that the watch face cover doesn't fit as snugly as I would like but at this price who can complain.,86644,4
86645,"This is an amazing shirt, don't get me wrong with the four star rating.",86645,4
86645,"The only reason it received this was that I felt it could (for a girl) be a little more v-neck style, but this is a PERSONAL PREFERENCE, and in no way the maker of the shirts fault.",86645,4
86645,The highlights of this shirt is definitely how incredibly soft it is and NOT see through at all.,86645,4
86645,"I really love a shirt that doesn't require me to wear ANOTHER shirt just to wear it, so this is great!",86645,4
86645,It hits perfectly on my hips to it's the perfect length and my belly does not pop out when I raise my arms.,86645,4
86645,"For size references, I ordered an XL in women's and typically wear an XL in women's.",86645,4
86646,I needed an extra large,86646,4
86647,Very happy with purchase - have been looking for a sparkly crystal bauble for a while!,86647,4
86648,i think this is quite good and does the job.,86648,4
86649,Nice and extra padded,86649,4
86650,Cute bag.. large to fit alot of items,86650,4
86651,The stone falls out of its holder bracket.,86651,4
86651,I put some superglue inside the rim and now it has not fallen out yet.,86651,4
86651,"Otherwise, it is very nice.",86651,4
86652,"The shirt was beautiful and lovely, very bright nice colors.",86652,4
86652,"It arrived fast, nice customer service!",86652,4
86652,Only problem is I am an American 2XL and their shirt is an Indian 2XL.,86652,4
86652,"It fits like a large on me, and I bought the 2XL shirt.",86652,4
86653,Really ornate and flattereing.,86653,4
86653,"I would have given 5 stars, but due to just a little bit of misadvertising, I was led to believe that the product with the pink opal was a 'white gold'.",86653,4
86653,"In the pictures, it is the only clicker that is silver in color.",86653,4
86653,"Sure enough, it got here overnight and was- a yellow gold.",86653,4
86653,"I'm keeping it to add diversity to my collection, but would have gotten the white or blue opal if I had known they were all yellow gold colored.",86653,4
86653,"On another note, if your considering this, but it, they're beautiful and are a really nice quality.",86653,4
86654,It fit as expected..just needed a small adjustment with the top.,86654,4
86654,I'm probably going to add a few more hooks/snaps so the top will be fit more secure and not come undone while wearing.,86654,4
86655,Works really well & very lightweight,86655,4
86656,The only minor complaint is that the rubber watchband gets a little sticky in high humidity.,86656,4
86656,"Overall, very good value.",86656,4
86658,I bought this shirt in a size large.,86658,4
86658,I normally wear size large or x-large depending on the clothing.,86658,4
86658,"Just to give you an idea of my body size, i am 5'3"" and wear a size 14 in jeans.",86658,4
86658,I wear a 38C and my waist measures at 38 inches.,86658,4
86658,I also have broad shoulders.,86658,4
86658,This shirt fit me well.,86658,4
86658,I would advise that if you are a skinny or small person that you go down a size as I was expecting the large to be a bit small.,86658,4
86658,The only issue I have with this shirt is that it is a bit thin.,86658,4
86658,However it is super cute.,86658,4
86659,"I really like the necklace as long as you come to terms that it is ""disposable"" jewelry.",86659,4
86659,After a monty or so of wearing it turns brown and ugly but it was worth the price.,86659,4
86660,"When I put on these pants, they were a little baggy, but it was nothing a belt couldn't fix.",86660,4
86660,I love all the pockets.,86660,4
86660,Like I never need a purse again.,86660,4
86661,This wig was as expected.,86661,4
86661,"Vibrant colors, and fit just right.",86661,4
86661,Was very cute with my happy clown costume.,86661,4
86663,"I'm 5'3"", 117 pounds, and I usually wear a size 0 in pants.",86663,4
86663,It's soft and size x-small fits me perfectly.,86663,4
86663,The only con is that it attracts lint because of the material.,86663,4
86663,"Other than that, it's a great staple to have in your closet!",86663,4
86664,Very cute for my sons first birthday party.,86664,4
86666,I bought this skirt for my bachelorette and it was pretty much exactly what I expected.,86666,4
86666,I was really short and really shimmery but that worked out great for my purposes!,86666,4
86666,This skirt arrived quickly and the color was exactly as I hoped it would be.,86666,4
86666,Maybe slightly lighter like another reviewer mentioned.,86666,4
86666,A few weird things...make sure to put the zipper on your side.,86666,4
86666,Initially I zipped it in the back and it fit really strangely and the bottom was uneven but then I realized I was putting the zipper in the wrong place and it was fine after that.,86666,4
86666,The sequins also shed like crazy.,86666,4
86666,the skirt still looks great after a night out but I found the sequins EVERYWHERE!,86666,4
86667,The picture is a little deceiving.,86667,4
86667,The dress actually fits more length wise like a shirt.,86667,4
86667,The underlayer/slip doesn't cover your underwear.,86667,4
86667,But it is pretty and can be worn with leggings if too short for liking.,86667,4
86668,Received these scarves today - my daughter is going to love them!,86668,4
86669,"For the most part, jacket is great, however sleeves are slightly too long and overall the jacket is a bit loose",86669,4
86670,Just what I need.,86670,4
86671,The bra stretches out a bit after the first washing.,86671,4
86671,So I would order for the next time one band size less 32B than I measured.,86671,4
86671,"Also it has 4 bra back clasps, it is about 2"" size variations.",86671,4
86672,I'll probably buy more in different colors.,86672,4
86672,I normally wear a large on my bottoms and they fit perfect.,86672,4
86672,"The only thing is, if you're like me and have large hips but a small waist, the waist band might be a bit hard to get over your butt, but once they're on they fit perfect.",86672,4
86673,This bracelet is really pretty-as it looks on screen.,86673,4
86673,The only complaint is that the clasp is tricky to do on your own.,86673,4
86675,wish the colors were more vibrant and cotton,86675,4
86676,great quality for the price.,86676,4
86676,runs just a smidgen tight for me even when i sized up.,86676,4
86676,I am 5'4 150 (small chest).,86676,4
86676,"I ordered L, but i think if I got XL it would be too big.",86676,4
86676,So I think i just need to get in a bit of shape and this would be perfect.,86676,4
86676,"Very cute suite, looks exactly like the picture!",86676,4
86676,I thought getting L would be too big on top but its not.,86676,4
86676,"both top and bottom are just a tad tight, but it doesn't look too bad.",86676,4
86676,Great suite if you can get a right fit.,86676,4
86677,The size of the purse if just right.,86677,4
86677,I like the idea of having a longer strap.,86677,4
86678,"Nice shorts, they fit him big but he is a slim boy.",86678,4
86678,There are elastic inserts to tighten the waist and that works very well,86678,4
86679,The fit is too large.,86679,4
86679,I am generally a size 8 - 10 and I just received this waist trainer.,86679,4
86679,I am already on the smallest size and its baggy in areas (underneath my breasts especially).,86679,4
86679,I ordered a smaller size.,86679,4
86679,Otherwise it is very comfortable and I would imagine it does suck you in fairly well if the size were correct.,86679,4
86679,The fabric is comfortable and the boning flexes to move with your body.,86679,4
86680,This is my new favorite shirt!,86680,4
86680,The color is bright and summery.,86680,4
86680,The cut of the shirt is very flattering.,86680,4
86680,You can dress it up with some ponte pants or skinny jeans or wear with leggings to dress it down.,86680,4
86680,I would buy it again and get it in the other colors.,86680,4
86681,Waayyyyy too long but still looks great if you fold the waste down,86681,4
86682,A little big but otherwise great,86682,4
86683,"Nice quality, vibrant color.",86683,4
86683,Great for a beginner!,86683,4
86684,It's cute and mostly comfortable but if your bigger breasted it's a little snug in that area.,86684,4
86685,"A little big on top, but the rest fits perfectly.",86685,4
86685,The dress is beautiful and much prettier in person than in the pictures.,86685,4
86686,"The jewelry is bigger than I expected, but it's a beautiful piece of jewelry.",86686,4
86686,I'm going to enjoy wearing it quite a bit.,86686,4
86687,"I ordered a size M, and this is definitely oversized.",86687,4
86687,"I probably could have ordered a S (I usually wear M/L in tops and a size 10 pants), but I would worry about the arm and neck holes being to snug.",86687,4
86687,"The fabric is very comfortable and lightweight, so it's perfect for summer days.",86687,4
86687,"However, i found it to be very short (I'm 5'5'' for reference) so I have to wear it over jeans or with shorts underneath.",86687,4
86687,"The white is also very sheer so be careful with what you wear underneath, you may want to layer a tank.",86687,4
86688,Will buy more in future,86688,4
86689,good w/ a little tilting with fast motion,86689,4
86690,I ordered a Large because the XL was out of stock and wouldn't get here in time that I needed it.,86690,4
86690,I am between sizes (traditionally and normally a large though I have a curvy body shape and have gained a little weight over the years).,86690,4
86690,I wanted to order the XL according to reviews so that I can be comfortable and not be subconscious but L is what I went with in the end.,86690,4
86690,I was overall happy!,86690,4
86690,I just wore a girdle to tuck away and smooth over any extras and some stockings and all was well!,86690,4
86690,Use shorts as this is a short dress but there is room to breathe.,86690,4
86690,I got compliments all day with this dress!,86690,4
86690,"Ladies, pair this with some boots and the wig (the 60s dreamgirls one, or make one) and instant Uhura.",86690,4
86690,You will not regret it and Trek fans will thank you and compliment you for your effort!,86690,4
86691,Fits a little small but very nice looks and material.,86691,4
86693,The fabric of this blouse is very good as is the color.,86693,4
86693,"The picture is accurate, however, it was larger than I expected.",86693,4
86693,I would order one size smaller.,86693,4
86694,"The dress was much longer on me then expected and the green color was very ""Kelly Green"" and did not look great on my complexion.",86694,4
86695,It is exactly what I thought it would be.,86695,4
86695,it will keep my face and head dry and it looks fine.,86695,4
86696,My niece LOVES it.,86696,4
86696,It did take a very long time to ship.,86696,4
86696,She received it a month later.,86696,4
86697,i will buy it again,86697,4
86698,I will be removing padding.,86698,4
86698,"All in all, I Love the swimsuit.",86698,4
86699,"Wish they were a bit better at staying up but, still a better brand for those of us with thicker thighs!",86699,4
86700,A bit tad long though.,86700,4
86700,"They midrise on me, they fit just below the belly button.",86700,4
86700,Tight enough to not bunch up but loose enough to not create love handles.,86700,4
86700,I am 5' 4 147lbs hips 41 waist 28 bust 38.,86700,4
86701,"a little bit to large for me, but i made it as a gift to a friend and it fit's him perfect :D",86701,4
86702,The shirt is very pretty and lends a classy look to your wardrobe.,86702,4
86702,"It can work in a casual or career setting, bearing in mind the semi-sheer back.",86702,4
86702,A flesh-colored camisole would be your friend when wearing this.,86702,4
86702,"The burgundy I purchased is a nice, rich hue.",86702,4
86702,"If you have a large chest, bear in mind that the shirt will fall in a boxy / tented way, but the area around the shoulders, neckline and arms gives it a tailored look that balances it out.",86702,4
86702,I think the top runs somewhere between true to size and lightly small.,86702,4
86702,"I'm a size 12, and the buttons in the back gape slightly.",86702,4
86702,This might look best if I kept the top button in the back unbuttoned.,86702,4
86702,"Downsides are that the fabric doesn't really breathe and is not very soft -- it has a polyester feel against the skin, so for that reason it doesn't quite feel like a ""summertime"" shirt or a go-to everyday shirt.",86702,4
86703,"Very cool, but over heats and gets a little scratchy at times but that's ok.",86703,4
86704,"Super cute, just a little thinner than I expected.",86704,4
86705,"These are a bit smaller than expected, but I really just ordered them to wear with pajama bottoms, so they work just fine.",86705,4
86706,The suit is cute.,86706,4
86706,The mesh is a lighter color and slightly less transparent than it appears in the photo.,86706,4
86706,"I deducted a star because the bottom is low rise, not ""Brazilian"" high cut like the photo.",86706,4
86706,"I listed this swimsuit as ""somewhat small""  only because 'IF' I had ordered a medium, my normal size in swimwear, it would have been too small.",86706,4
86706,"I am small, I easily wear size 3 jeans.",86706,4
86706,I am a 34C.,86706,4
86706,"Just under 5'2"" and currently, after a lot of hard work, under 110 lbs.",86706,4
86706,"I try to avoid bottoms that cut in, these don't, but if I try to pull the sides as high as they look in the photo they won't stay, and the mesh bunches together.",86706,4
86706,I bought this to tan in my yard because I wanted minimal high leg tan lines.,86706,4
86706,I will probably use a different suit.,86706,4
86707,"I don't care for the faux fur around the hood, but otherwise it is really nice.",86707,4
86707,Much warmer than I was expecting when it first arrived.,86707,4
86707,"Originally when I took it out of the package it was shipped in (large envelope, not a box) it seemed like it was very flat and without a lot of substance.",86707,4
86707,"HOWEVER, once I hung it up, it ""decompressed"".",86707,4
86707,It has very nice detailing trim on the cuff and front placket.,86707,4
86707,"If it didn't have the faux fur, I'd have given it 5 stars.",86707,4
86708,They're longer than I expected but they're good nonetheless,86708,4
86709,Bought to replace a wedding ring.,86709,4
86709,Smooth finish and rounded edges.,86709,4
86709,Heavier in weight than the white gold ring that it replaced.,86709,4
86709,"After a month, it's still shiny and shows no evidence of scratches.",86709,4
86710,Snug fit but really nice.,86710,4
86710,"I wish it was more of a slouchy beanie type fit, but its warm and looks pretty.",86710,4
86711,"Kind of slick fabric, I expected a more cottony feel but overall a nice shirt.",86711,4
86712,"I didn't know what to expect ordering it in my bra size, but other than being a little tight (I'm normally a size 10) it was great.",86712,4
86712,I like the cut and love how it slims my midsection.,86712,4
86713,Very cute comfortable dress!,86713,4
86713,It's a tad long for me.,86713,4
86713,I'm 5'2 size xl.,86713,4
86714,"My husband likes these Sanford tees, they run a little small, I'd order a size up",86714,4
86715,It was a little big for my daughter but she will grow into it.,86715,4
86715,It was very soft and comfortable to wear.,86715,4
86716,This tie clip looks and feels great especially with a Star Wars nerd like me.,86716,4
86717,"A little too small, but very nicely made",86717,4
86719,"nice dress, too small at the top",86719,4
86720,It is very useful.,86720,4
86720,Overall I like it except its small size.,86720,4
86720,That does cause me a little frustrated sometimes.,86720,4
86721,Great except the back tends to roll up a bit when sitting down.,86721,4
86722,Could have been slightly thinker but not bad.,86722,4
86723,Had to cut it.,86723,4
86723,Too long for my five year old.,86723,4
86723,"Big enough for a regular sized teen, to me.",86723,4
86724,"Fit well, but the bottoms run small.",86724,4
86724,I recommend going a size up if you do squats!,86724,4
86725,"other than some of the beads and decorations missing, the dress was perfect...",86725,4
86726,I ordered a large and I'd say it fit true to size (I'm a size 10 and a B-cup).,86726,4
86726,"It is thin material, but that's what I expected.",86726,4
86727,I have worn these shoes to skateboard in for years and they are perfect for what I need them for,86727,4
86729,These leggings do the job of graduated compression for pregnant women unlucky enough to have to deal with varicose veins.,86729,4
86729,I'm in my third trimester and wear them daily.,86729,4
86729,My favorite part of these is how well they fit through the belly panel.,86729,4
86729,"Compared to Terramed brand (which I also purchased), they stay put and they lie flat and smooth, making the belly panel easier to conceal.",86729,4
86729,"The compressions isn't quite as strong compared to the Terramed leggings, but they are more comfortable overall.",86729,4
86729,"The material is great, but I have had to sew/repair small holes in the crotch area twice since I've had them (about 6 weeks).",86729,4
86729,"I wish they were stronger through that area, and they are also see through from the upper thigh through the crotch/butt area, making them difficult to style with unless they are worn under and dress long enough to cover everything but short enough not to look like a 7 year old.",86729,4
86729,I truly wish I could find a pair of true graduates compression maternity leggings (15-20 or 20-30mmgh) that are completely opaque.,86729,4
86730,Great color very bright and vibrant.,86730,4
86731,I bought it for my daughter and it fit real nice.,86731,4
86733,I'm usually a large and bought an xl and it fits a like a medium.,86733,4
86733,But its still very nice.,86733,4
86733,I wouldn't call it a swaleatshirt either as its not make out of cotton,86733,4
86735,"""small"" was too wide on my 115lb girlfriend, but OK as a beach cover-up.",86735,4
86736,My 2 year old for her mermaid bday party..she loves it so much she's actually napping in it bc she didn't want to take it off.,86736,4
86736,"It's very pretty and shiny, the stitch that's supposed to hold the seashells together on the top was broken but it can easily be fixed.",86736,4
86736,The tail is a bit long for walking in but for pictures it will be perfect.,86736,4
86737,Looks great but runs small.,86737,4
86737,Will advice to order one size up,86737,4
86738,"These shoes were just as pretty as I thought they would be, but they were way too big.",86738,4
86738,"I purchased them for my daughter for a wedding and they were too big, she couldn't wear them.",86738,4
86738,"Unfortunately, the wedding couldn't be postponed another year for her to grow in to them.",86738,4
86739,It is very cute but I think it is a little pricy considering the cupcake is not embroidered.,86739,4
86739,Wish I could have gotten it in a 9month size....our girl is on the smaller side.,86739,4
86740,"Super cute, easy to clean, great fit.",86740,4
86741,I got this top in Eggplant.,86741,4
86741,"The neckline could go a bit lower as it looks a bit ""pulled"" if you have broader shoulders, but I'm 5.5 months pregnant and this hides the baby bump very gracefully, and I'll definitely be wearing it after pregnancy as well.",86741,4
86741,I've gotten lots of compliments on it :),86741,4
86742,This is a nice suit for the money.,86742,4
86742,"Fits true to size and is lined which is nice, but that doesn't make it too hot at all.",86742,4
86742,"However, the bra cups aren't sewn in so they can and do move around a little, which is irritating but not a deal breaker.",86742,4
86743,"This blouse was very cute, with a slightly imperfection  on the sleeve",86743,4
86744,"Nice fitted shirt, buy larger.",86744,4
86745,I typically wear a S/M in shirts.,86745,4
86745,"I ordered WAY up based on reviews, so the body of this shirt is loose fit, but the sleeves are still a little bit snug.",86745,4
86745,"The shirt looks good, but it would has been crazy small had I ordered my normal size.",86745,4
86746,We like I got this for my wife.,86746,4
86746,Really looks good on her.,86746,4
86746,Great for a spring or summer party night.,86746,4
86747,It's alright...wear with a belt for better fit.,86747,4
86748,Soft but a little smaller than I expected.,86748,4
86748,I still wear it because it's awesome.,86748,4
86750,"Don't feel terribly sturdy, but great colors",86750,4
86751,"good ,but ii is too small",86751,4
86754,Daughter loved it and wore to an animal convention.,86754,4
86756,Bought it for a family member.,86756,4
86756,I think it was a great buy for the price.,86756,4
86756,Might get myself one now!,86756,4
86757,Good pocketable size + RFID protection = Happy hubby!,86757,4
86757,He uses a Band Joe elastic instead of a wallet so had to use a sleeve for every individual chip card.,86757,4
86757,This conveniently allows all chip cards to be in one protected place and is less bulky than multiple sleeves (which just get beat up and ugly).,86757,4
86757,"Only reason for 4 stars vs. 5 is that, once you add inflexible cards, the center compartment is not easy to access; a small gusset might help, but it still serves its purpose well and looks nice in the process.",86757,4
86757,Plan to order more for gifts.,86757,4
86758,Used as a wedding dress - 4 stars because I had to replace the under slip which came above my knee and clearly showed under the white fabric.,86758,4
86758,"After this change, it was beautiful.",86758,4
86758,"I'm 36DD, so had to wear something supportive underneath; the sheerness of the top made it a requirement too.",86758,4
86758,I draped a gold shawl around my shoulders.,86758,4
86759,My daughter loved it and so fishnet birthday party guests,86759,4
86760,Shirt seemed to run a little short in the torso.,86760,4
86760,Good material good quality,86760,4

86762,Fit was expect and is comfortable.,86762,4
86763,Love the way this fits.,86763,4
86763,I'm 5'2 105 pounds and the extra small fit great and hugged in the right places.,86763,4
86763,The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the picture shows it with a belt that i never received.,86763,4
86763,However I have my own belts so won't be a huge problem,86763,4
86765,Cute but run slightly big.,86765,4
86767,I got these for my husband to wear with his dress/loafers and he loves them!!!!,86767,4
86767,"Good quality socks, compared to some others I have purchased for him, and he loves how comfortable they are.",86767,4
86768,I'm only giving it 4 stars because it took forever to get here.,86768,4
86768,But order 1 or 2 sizes up.,86768,4
86768,I'm a medium but I ordered a XXL and it fits perfectly.,86768,4
86771,"Nice ring, but set to high for my liking",86771,4
86772,The stays on one of the two I bought poke in to my side though.,86772,4
86773,"the top was fine, but I couldn't get the skirt about my knees.",86773,4
86773,Will probably do some alterations to make it work :p,86773,4
86774,"I like it, but can only wear as house-dress.",86774,4
86774,"I got the large, I am a medium or less, so if you want to buy this, get your exact American size.",86774,4
86774,Note also that this is a V-neck and lots of space around the arm-pit.,86774,4
86774,"For the price, I recommend you to buy it.",86774,4
86775,My son just turned 3 today.,86775,4

86775,In this iplay swim diaper the 3t fits his waist and height well.,86775,4
86775,"A bit too snug in the thighs, but he has chubby thighs.",86775,4
86775,So measure your little ones thighs.,86775,4
86775,They left marks on his thighs after just trying on.,86775,4
86775,"It will keep the solids in, but will be too uncomfortable for his thighs.",86775,4
86775,"I tried a different brand, Finis in 4t and was too loose in both waist and thighs, would not keep solids in at all.",86775,4
86775,"I've got a 4t in Iplay brand on the way, I'm hoping its snug enough in the waist to make his thighs more comfy and keep solids in.",86775,4
86775,"Of course I hope we never have to test the solids in the pool, but want to be safe just in case.",86775,4
86775,"UPDATE: the IPlay 4t came, and it fits well.",86775,4
86775,"It is much better in the thighs, and just barely tight enough at the waist to keep everything in.",86775,4
86776,"I like this, it's casual and dressy faberic nice.",86776,4
86776,The color seems different then shown tho.,86776,4
86776,Looks more purple then blue.,86776,4
86777,"Everything is good about it except the waist is a little high on me, it covers up the belly button and it is slim so I get a bit of a muffin top.",86777,4
86778,just a little loose around the calves,86778,4
86779,It's not the color it shows.,86779,4
86779,Has brown in it.,86779,4
86779,Also its long but runs very small.,86779,4
86779,I still wear it and get compliments often.,86779,4

86781,I love these round pendants!,86781,4
86782,"The scarf is nice, a pretty red color, but  the material is really thin.",86782,4
86782,It looks much thicker in the picture.,86782,4
86783,Looks good with a sleeveless top underneath.,86783,4
86784,somewhat large on top.,86784,4
86785,"Looks great and worked for a last minute ring util we got him a new one when he lost his original, and prime so we got it before we went on vacation",86785,4
86786,It was a little larger than I thought but I like it.,86786,4
86787,disappointed the gift bag not included as product promised,86787,4
86788,"Sturdy enough, but this is my 2nd case.....",86788,4
86790,This little gadget is a lifesaver.,86790,4
86790,"It's perfect for if a shirt is too low, or button fell off, or attached bra straps to a shirt so they won't be seen.",86790,4
86790,"Only thing is, it didn't come with the stitches, but I believe they are sending them.",86790,4

86792,There was a small hole in the hood part when I received it in the package and tried it on.,86792,4
86792,"It's not so big but it's noticeable, at least I can sew it.",86792,4
86792,"The size fits me, I usually wear size small and it was a bit loose but if you want to be comfortable like for sleeping get a size bigger.",86792,4
86792,The quality is good for the cold weather because it has a fleece like texture.,86792,4

86795,His favorite aspect is the exposed breasts.,86795,4
86795,I plan on looking up the other models from the back of the packaging.,86795,4
86795,"The only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because the thighs were a bit tight and I had to do some major readjusting to get a more comfortable fit but overall, I love it and expect to wear it regularly.",86795,4
86795,"Fyi because I know this info helps me when deciding, I'm 5'4"" and around 140 lbs.",86795,4
86795,"Average height but curvy, hence the tight thighs.",86795,4
86796,Will be a very comfy dress just a little Tighe in the waist,86796,4
86797,Looks great just but could use better material.,86797,4
86798,A little thin but very cute.,86798,4

86803,Very soft material so no chafing and didn't sweat.,86803,4
86804,It feels a bit oversized.,86804,4
86804,"I'm 5'9 and 165 and I ordered a medium and it's a little looser than I normally like, but otherwise it's a nice top.",86804,4
86804,I'd just order a size smaller.,86804,4
86806,Exactly what she asked for ......,86806,4

86813,"I love it, however it is super delicate.",86813,4
86813,You need to be extra careful because it easy gets loose threads and easy gets holes done by fingers or your nails depending how you hold it.,86813,4

86818,It has a lot of street but not for wide hips,86818,4
86819,Love them but only issue is they are not long enough so if you are taller then 5'10 they will be a little to short I am am 6'2 and they com up at the top of my ankle but other than that love the design they look like the picture and they are very comfortable..,86819,4
86819,But 4 other styles thru them and love them..,86819,4
86820,I ordered 2 pair black/blue My son feel right in love with the sneakers as soon as i open the box..The colors are very bright they're great at night ..but lights can also be seen in the day light..,86820,4

86834,it was a bit large on me and rather long even with heels it was too long so I did have to have it tailored.,86834,4
86835,They are worth every penny...for looks.,86835,4
86835,"The arm part is sort of a spring mechanism, feels a bit wobbly.",86835,4

86839,My husband loved this product!!,86839,4
86841,I really like the sunglasses and delivery was very fast.,86841,4
86841,My only complaint is that they are a little big for my face.,86841,4
86841,"However, they are very cute.",86841,4
86842,it feels 2 sizes too large maybe more when it should only be one size larger,86842,4
86844,"Design was exactly as in the pictures, fit was perfect.",86844,4
86844,My only complaint was it's somewhat thick of a material for a tee shirt that you'd wear in the summer.,86844,4
86845,Very soft and looks good with a longer tunic or dress.,86845,4
86845,It is on the thin side.,86845,4

86847,Also the material is see through in yellow .,86847,4
86847,"I'm sure darker colors won't be as see through , but since the material is thin rayon, you can see my nips .",86847,4
86847,I am keeping the dress and cutting it shorter (right below the knee length ) and I will have my semstresss make the bottom tighter .,86847,4

86851,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that Peppa's ears curl forward at the first wash.  Ironing will help straightening them up a bit, but not really worth it.",86851,4
86851,"Bottom line:  this dress is priced well, great for spring and summer wear and may make it through to next spring for our GD, as it is a generous A-line cut.",86851,4
86854,I ordered the 2 piece orange.,86854,4
86854,There are a few threads out of place but when I tried it on it was nice and I wear a 38DD.,86854,4
86854,The top it's all in how you wrap it.,86854,4
86854,"I saw alot of complaints about it not being enough clothe to cover the top, I had enough to make a bow hanging down my back.",86854,4
86854,If you look at the model the inside of her breast are showing that's what makes it sexy.,86854,4
86854,I'll fix the few threads and wear my suit proudly.,86854,4
86854,It is see through though!,86854,4
86855,"This stretchy skirt comes in a thin spandex-like material, so you'll need tights or leggings under it.",86855,4
86855,The print is gorgeous!,86855,4
86855,The skirt we purchased features Alice in Wonderland in a watercolor-like print.,86855,4
86855,"The fit is one size, so it stretches to accommodate most sizes/body types.",86855,4
86855,My daughter has worn it several times and has been pleased with the compliments she's received.,86855,4
86855,My only complaint is that there is no hem or stitching at the bottom of the skirt.,86855,4
86855,It's just kind of cut off (neatly) so it's basically a piece of material with some elastic at the waistband.,86855,4
86855,Still a fun and pretty novelty skirt.,86855,4
86856,Fits perfectly but its better for those with a C cup or less honestly.,86856,4
86856,Its a perfect and is true to size!,86856,4
86857,"These head bands look great when you hold them,they are not as cute on the baby's head.",86857,4
86857,"(Not as large on baby's head as pictured) Very cute colors,very nice fit for most heads and comfortable for baby band is soft and not irritating on head.",86857,4
86858,"I like Saxx, but the Vibe doesn't fit the same as the Ultra.",86858,4
86858,"I'm a 34"" waist and the M is perfect for the Ultra but too small with the Vibe.",86858,4
86858,I would suggest buying a size bigger with the Vibe.,86858,4
86859,Perfect for what my daughter needed,86859,4
86860,It ended up being too small for my needs but is a very nice bag.,86860,4
86860,Just need more space.,86860,4
86860,I carry too much crap,86860,4
86861,"Prefect for the 4th of July, a lot of people compliment me on it.",86861,4
86861,"Runs a little big, but overall solid purchase.",86861,4
86863,The belt appears good quality and you cannot beat the price (especially considering that you are getting 2 belts).,86863,4
86863,Unlike other reviewers I did not have any sizing problems.,86863,4
86863,I wear pants size 32 and belt for sizes 32-34 worked just fine.,86863,4
86863,The only complaint I can make about this belt is that it is very thick and rigid.,86863,4
86864,"Not bad, not perfect",86864,4
86865,I liked it and it's pretty!,86865,4
86865,It arrived even before the expected date.,86865,4
86866,"Beautiful dress) nice silhouette, bright colors and the right style for the  beach pictures.",86866,4
86866,The only thing I don't like - the skirt doesn't fly ( there is always windy on the ocean and some pictures looks reddicolous (like I have a huge ass and a disproportionately small top).,86866,4
86866,"Material is good and the top part is made of a dense tissue, so I was able to wear it without the bra (by the way I wear the 36DD).I bought the XL size, because the products runs smaller.",86866,4
86867,They were a little larger than I expected but they keep my ears very warm.,86867,4
86868,It's great bag if you don't carry many items.,86868,4
86868,"I tend to overstuff my handbags, and the size of this bag makes that much harder.",86868,4
86869,Just as i was hoping.,86869,4
86871,"Patch is awesome and hilarious, but hat is wayyyy too small for my GF and she has a normal sized head haha.",86871,4
86871,"However, patch seems like it would be easy to remove and sew onto a larger hat.",86871,4
86872,It's better than I thought it would be.,86872,4
86872,Just need crotch part to be a little wider around my inner thighs because it's a bit too tight,86872,4
86873,No elastic at all in the waist,86873,4
86874,My daughter thinks the color is different though from what we ordered.,86874,4
86874,A little too big on her.,86874,4
86874,Very nice quality though!,86874,4
86874,I would recommend the dress!,86874,4
86875,"Only reason not 5 stars is they are on the thin side, needed something a little warmer but otherwise they are cute.",86875,4
86875,Would recommend hand wash and air dry to prevent shrinkage,86875,4
86876,Definitely cheaper than LEGOs but my 4 year old son loves them!,86876,4
86877,There are NO backs to any of these earrings!,86877,4
86878,This is not the owl  pattern that I ordered but I am keeping it anyway.,86878,4
86878,A little large .,86878,4
86880,A little small but it still fits.,86880,4
86880,My baby likes it,86880,4
86882,Good leggings for the price but the colors do not match the products.,86882,4
86883,I bought this as a gift for my sister.,86883,4
86883,I thought it was funny that it had the flask in the scarf and thought it would be helpful for Packer games.,86883,4
86883,The scarf material is not the best quality but I was expecting that.,86883,4
86883,It is also not very warm.,86883,4
86883,This is a very good joke gift!,86883,4
86884,The item arrived earlier than expected.,86884,4
86884,The hoodie is made of great quality and is extremely comfortable.,86884,4
86884,I am 5'7 athletic build and ordered the Large.,86884,4
86884,The only issue I have with the hoodie is the A phi A letters are made of cheaper material I am concerned may rub off with normal wear and tear at some point.,86884,4
86884,The shield as well as other aspects of the hoodie are made of quality thread/stitching.,86884,4
86884,I recommend the hoodie and it would be a great probate gift!,86884,4
86884,Add chapter letters on the sleeve and you are set.,86884,4
86885,Cute hat perfect for summer nice quality,86885,4
86886,I didn't expect the material to be as slick as it is.,86886,4
86887,"Only one problem it digs into ur skin by the underarm , other thn tht its ok",86887,4
86888,Do you have that in yellow,86888,4
86889,Fits my 8 year old but not for long.,86889,4
86890,bracelet is nice and good quality but i think a certificate would be more trustful,86890,4
86891,"My grand daughter loved it, wanted it so she could to wear it to school to show her opinion of school.",86891,4
86892,Its cotton material and tends to stretch a bit the longer you wear it.,86892,4
86894,Perfect for our DL trips.,86894,4
86895,I wear size 8 1/2 so ordered 9.,86895,4
86895,Works okay but is 1/2 size too big.,86895,4
86895,Took a star off as they don't wear that long.,86895,4
86895,I'm on my second pair because the heel (under foot where it touches the floor) and toe (on top slipper) areas wore through to a white fabric.,86895,4
86895,Feel price should be a bit lower because of this.,86895,4
86896,What a great idea AND it's executed magnificently.,86896,4
86896,A word of caution regarding sizing; if you're on the fence (between sizes) order the smaller size!,86896,4
86896,I'm a pant size 13/14 and ordered a Large but it is way too big!,86896,4
86896,"The garter dropped right down my leg as I walked around and the only items I ""packed"" were my ID and some cash.",86896,4
86897,I know the top design seems a little odd but I think that's what makes it cute.,86897,4
86897,The size was perfect as expected and describe.,86897,4
86898,The material is thinner than I expected but overall I LOVE the dress.,86898,4
86898,It fits perfectly; I expected it to be too big or have the proportions way off like some of the other similar dresses (different brands) from Amazon but it's great.,86898,4
86898,Can't wait to wear it to work!,86898,4
86899,It fits big should have gotten a smaller size over all I love it,86899,4
86900,"fit very well,  washed a couple of times and is still like new.",86900,4
86901,"The back is cut lower than what it shows, meaning if you wore a bra, it will show",86901,4
86903,I really like the product but what disappointed that it was not a bit longer.,86903,4
86905,Gorgeous color and fits beautifully.,86905,4
86906,"Service is great, product quality is, too.",86906,4
86906,"Photo on line made wallet appear larger than it is, however, so they won't work for what we had in mind, but we'll keep the three we ordered and use them for gifts.",86906,4
86906,Too bad: we really like them...,86906,4
86907,"beautiful material and print, just wish it was longer, wider.",86907,4
86908,"It is a normal sized umbrella when opened, but it compacts up shorter than the wine bottle versions of this.",86908,4
86908,The case is shorter too.,86908,4
86908,It looks like a water bottle and its small enough to fit in my five year olds school back pack.,86908,4
86908,We just got it yesterday so we didn't get a chance to use it in the rain yet.,86908,4
86908,"My son can open and close it himself, and after a short little lesson, he can put it away on his own too.",86908,4
86908,I will update my rating based on how he does with this at school in the rain.,86908,4
86909,Great shirt but too big.,86909,4

86911,"Nice colors for alt 4th scarf, good length.",86911,4
86911,"Bit itchy and cheap material, but you get what you pay for.",86911,4
86912,Little on the small side.,86912,4
86913,Color has faded a bit but it fits well,86913,4
86914,expensive for the poor last,86914,4
86915,"I got the 36"" waist, and they fit perfectly.",86915,4

86915,The color was as pictured.,86915,4
86915,"The fabric used is on the lighter side, which is good for the summer.",86915,4
86915,"There are strings at the bottom of the legs to cinch the ends, but I pulled those out instantly.",86915,4
86916,"I already had a alumawallet, but it couldn't fit all of my cards in it.",86916,4
86916,I got this one because it was top rated.,86916,4
86916,It fit about 6 cards and is thinner than my other wallet.,86916,4
86916,The latch seems strong.,86916,4
86916,"I know from experience not to over stuff, or the latch will open.",86916,4
86916,"Between the two, I can fit all my cards and license.",86916,4
86916,It would be nice if BRYK offered a wallet that holds more cards.,86916,4
86918,The only aspect that I don`t like is that the hem is not hand sewn and rolled.,86918,4
86918,Usually at this price the scarves are hand hemmed.,86918,4
86919,"I bought it for a gift, but it was so cute I am going to order for myself.",86919,4
86920,"The way you see the model wearing it, is the same way it'll look on you.",86920,4
86920,"The V is very deep V, and it's definitely above the knee.",86920,4
86920,"The only thing that isn't pictured, is that it's open in the back underneath the cape.",86920,4
86920,It zips a little bit above the waist,86920,4
86921,Little heavy but so comfortable.,86921,4
86922,"More loose around the mid section than I was hoping, but I think with a wide belt it will be great!",86922,4
86923,I normally take a large and it fit too tight.,86923,4
86923,Loved the material and style.,86923,4
86924,I like it for the purpose that I got it for.,86924,4
86924,"I got it to wear around the pool or beach as a kind of cover-up, which is perfect for that.",86924,4
86924,"But, if you want to get this to wear as a regular crop top, beware, them hem is short.",86924,4
86924,"If I wore this as a shirt, I'd be scared that I'd be flashing people on the street if the wind blew just right.",86924,4
86924,"Also, the top does tend to go off one shoulder, but not all the time.",86924,4
86924,"The material is light and thin, as soft cotton as a F21 or Charlotte Rouse shirt.",86924,4
86924,"I'd be careful when washing it, it does feel especially delicate.",86924,4
86924,"But, over all, I really like it!",86924,4
86925,Came early and I'm 5'2 and got a medium and it was a bit small for me but still good,86925,4

86926,They need to make it in women's as its a bit big but not overly.,86926,4
86927,Love this shirt as it has my name on it.,86927,4
86927,"But in my opinion, it did run a tad small.",86927,4
86927,But I am losing weight so it is fitting better now.,86927,4
86927,It isn't a thick tee by any stretch...but it does the job for what I wanted it to do.,86927,4
86927,"After several washing's & drying's, it still looks as good as new.",86927,4
86927,With little to no shrinkage.,86927,4
86929,While this item was a little large and the ribbon to go over my neck was short  I was able to fix those small problems and I love my corset.,86929,4
86930,For the price it's really cute.,86930,4
86931,Great look and fit,86931,4
86932,It is a bit too long for me as I am short.,86932,4
86932,So will need to alter the length,86932,4
86933,Love the bright color!,86933,4
86933,The padding inside looked crinkly so I'm glad that I was able to take it out.,86933,4
86934,Looks a little cheap but for 10 can't complain.,86934,4
86934,Holds 15 bills and 4 cards nicely.,86934,4
86935,"The duffel bag is pretty convenience while traveling, however, it cant not stand on its own.",86935,4
86936,The bikini is very cute and as seen in the photo.,86936,4

86937,Good but different from photos.,86937,4
86938,These are fun glasses.,86938,4
86938,"They could stand to be a bit wider across the front, but fit is OK.",86938,4
86938,Being polarized is a big plus.,86938,4
86939,"I'm typically a small in a ""normal"" t-shirt size.",86939,4
86939,I think a small would have been just fine.,86939,4
86939,"I ordered a medium and it was definitely big, but kept as I was hoping for a larger fit.",86939,4
86940,Very feminine and cute.,86940,4
86940,"Looks great under a suit jacket, slacks, or casual with jeans",86940,4
86941,Wife was very pleased.,86941,4
86942,Nothing wrong with this belt.,86942,4
86942,"The buckle, leather, and canvas belt all look great.",86942,4
86942,For casual dress the canvas looks better than leather and thicker but not heavy.,86942,4
86942,"Fits great, size 38 slacks and ordered size 40.",86942,4
86943,Very cute and seems to be well made and spacious enough to add purse accessories.,86943,4
86945,"Warm enough, works with smart phone.",86945,4
86946,The shirt is super comfortable.,86946,4
86946,It is perfect to pair with leggings and has a sleek look to it.,86946,4
86947,I love my new waste trainer.,86947,4
86947,Makes me thin even when I'm bloated.,86947,4
86949,"Doesn't have the same ""bunched up"" look as the pictures as I would have hoped but still small and sexy.",86949,4
86949,Wife loves them as they are comfy and I think she looks great in them.,86949,4
86950,"Very sexy, very soft and very hot!",86950,4
86950,this is very easy to clean and is impossible to wrinkle.,86950,4
86950,Very good quality material from what you would expect.,86950,4
86951,"It's not so much that the length is somewhat small, but the width of the shoe is narrow.",86951,4
86951,"We were told to go a half size up from what he normally wears, and this worked.",86951,4
86951,"The shoe fits great, and my high school son said the cleats feel like he's been wearing them for months even though he's only been wearing them for one week... no blisters either.",86951,4
86951,"The shoe strings are thinner than we are used to, so hopefully they will last.",86951,4
86951,"If the cleats last without coming unstitched or separated for the next 6 months, we would bump the rating up to five stars.",86951,4
86952,Hope it washes okay.,86952,4
86954,This jewelry is stunning and beautiful.,86954,4
86954,It seems like good quality and good for the price.,86954,4
86954,"However, I honestly did not realize this was an ear CUFF only and no post to attach to my earlobe.",86954,4
86954,"It seems over the top for everyday wear so I would only wear it if I were to dress up for a formal event like a cocktail party, prom, or wedding.",86954,4
86954,It doesn't seem very secure though and might fall off if going dancing.,86954,4
86954,It is also not practical if you wear your hair down because you hair will cover it up or accidentally get caught in the cuff and make it fall off.,86954,4
86954,Very pretty and good price but I'm going to return it because I wanted something I can wear everyday that I don't have to worry about it getting caught in my hair.,86954,4
86954,The product came in a basic cardboard box.,86954,4
86954,"FYI, I bought the left side blue.",86954,4
86954,"At the writing of this review, this color/side combination is no longer available.",86954,4
86955,"very colorful and attracts attention, would like it to be a little more stable.",86955,4
86956,I ordered up in size and got the 12-18mo size for my approximately 17lb 8 mo old daughter.,86956,4
86956,Fits well with some room to grow,86956,4
86957,"I'm not big on wearing bracelets, but this particular one is great, not too flashy, durable and not flimsy at all.",86957,4
86958,"Great novelty shirt, and gets lots of comments, but the shirt is really short.",86958,4
86958,"I'm only 5'1"" and it ""short shirts"" me...so size up if you want coverage.",86958,4
86959,"To small for me,but will give as gift.",86959,4
86960,The bathing suit is a cute fit for the price especially!,86960,4
86960,The designed is print stamped into the material so at first it doesn't look like the best quality but it looks great on!,86960,4
86960,I ordered a large and am 5-6 155lbs with a 34D bust.,86960,4
86960,It sit perfectly under my boobs but I'd recommend someone to get an XL because they may peak out under.,86960,4
86960,I wish it was adjustable but goes on like a shirt.,86960,4
86961,"Nice, you get what you pay for.",86961,4
86962,"It is a cute dress, but is very shear.",86962,4
86962,Have to buy something else to go underneath it just to wear,86962,4
86963,Overall they are comfortable and have what feels like an extra amount of material to help prevent chafing.,86963,4
86963,"After working out in these I do believe their a top brand to use when being active, but everyday use these are a little pricey to me.",86963,4
86963,I bought this pair for $20 and believe it to be a fair price.,86963,4
86963,"However, I have seen some priced at $38 and there is no way I would pay more than $25- $27.",86963,4
86963,My favorite feature is that they do not ride up at all!!,86963,4
86964,Perfect summer dress that is flowy and loose.,86964,4
86966,"its nice fit, but a little on thins side but overall I like it I like the way the collar stands out with white , I get a of compliments on it",86966,4
86968,It looked good in person.,86968,4
86968,Just didn't expect the fabric to be so loud and not soft.,86968,4
86968,"I actually liked it on, just a bit big.",86968,4
86968,It had a weird chemical smell when I opened it though.,86968,4
86969,Material is thinner than I expected.,86969,4
86969,Swimsuit was worth the price.,86969,4
86970,"The scarves are nice, I do like them.",86970,4
86970,"However, the one print I was most looking forward to was not included in my shipment.",86970,4
86970,"The five patterns that were shown in my order were red with polka dots, black with hearts, skulls, tribal aztec and a colorful button print.",86970,4
86970,Instead of the colorful button print I received a blue and white nautical print.,86970,4
86971,"Love this dress, and wore it a lot during the summer months.",86971,4
86971,"However, after a couple washes the fabric started to pinch.",86971,4
86972,I like to wear it with tights.,86972,4
86972,"I'm 5'10"" and it's short for me but I still love it.",86972,4
86973,Thin material but covers well.,86973,4
86973,A bit too hot for summer I'd say but ok for the cooler spring months.,86973,4
86973,I would say the laces over the chest area are represented well in the picture so your girls will look similar.,86973,4
86973,I have a small torso and the lacing stops right at the spot it does on this model.,86973,4
86974,its a pretty costume but the dress is a little bit bigger  for me .,86974,4
86974,I need to fix it by myself  I'm 5.6'' 105 lb,86974,4
86976,"I am 6'3"" and 180lbs and the medium tall fits well over a tweed sport jacket.",86976,4

86976,One star off for no loop hanger and a slightly sticky zipper.,86976,4
86977,I'm a Medium US.,86977,4
86977,Order item a size larger.,86977,4
86978,I purchased the teal and burgundy set.,86978,4
86978,"The teal one is perfect, but the red one came with a huge snag and a bunch of loose threads that I've had to cut off.",86978,4
86978,I'm going to have to sew the snag into the underside of the hat because it sticks up when I wear it.,86978,4
86978,I like the people complaining that these aren't slouchy don't know how to wear this type of hat.,86978,4
86978,"You can't pull them down straight from the top of your head like a normal hat, you need to put them on from the back, and leave your bangs area uncovered.",86978,4
86978,That's the cutest way to wear them and how you can get that slouchy look.,86978,4
86979,Very well fitted and liked very much.,86979,4
86980,as little difficult to get unattached but really like the way it looks.,86980,4
86981,I like the jacket but thought it was going to be like sweater type thickness.,86981,4
86981,But overall I really like it you can wear in the summer also at night if it gets a little cool.,86981,4
86983,it's nice but it is small for me.,86983,4
86984,"It is a very cute top, it does run smaller than indicated.",86984,4
86984,I would go one size larger than you need.,86984,4
86985,I usually get a Medium but since most of the reviews say its short than expected I got a Large.,86985,4
86985,"It was perfect, it wasn't to short to get a size larger.",86985,4
86985,I am 5'2 and weight 140 .,86985,4
86986,Cute back look and the way it looks with strappy heels.,86986,4
86986,Would have preferred a lighter color but overall great look,86986,4
86987,"The purse is great, just the right size and exactly as described.",86987,4
86987,"It took twice as long to get to me though, it didn't even ship by expected arrival date.",86987,4
86988,Good for wearing under dresses/skirts for a little more coverage.,86988,4
86988,"Material is not super thick, but it does help reduce visible underwear lines.",86988,4
86988,"The waistband is stretchy, which I appreciate.",86988,4
86989,For the Price it will work for the night!!,86989,4
86990,"Good quality, but runs a little big.",86990,4
86991,"My wife is normally wear size 19 and this was a little large for her (5.6"", 153 lbs) Other that looks great.",86991,4
86993,This dress is very pretty and great for summer.,86993,4
86993,It is a bit large and flowy - you could probably easily order one size down.,86993,4
86993,"I love the tie for the neck, which actually helps make the shoulder area length adjustable.",86993,4
86993,"It is a bit see-through in the top portion (light-colored fabric area), just because it is such a lightweight fabric, but looks fine with all white under garments.",86993,4
86993,I have received compliments every time I have worn it!,86993,4
86993,"I am 5'4"" and the length is fine for a dress (a bit above the knee but not too short).",86993,4
86995,"Blouse is a bit short, but overall a good buy, true to size.",86995,4
86996,I often run in between sizes in the Blazers as I have broad shoulders.,86996,4
86996,I usually wear a small and Most shirts or sometimes extra small but typically wear a four or six in blazers due to my shoulders.,86996,4
86996,After reading some reviews about this in a medium and it is a bit large for me and I wish I had purchased a small.,86996,4
86996,The stitching is well done.,86996,4
86996,It is not as stiff of fabric/structure as some more formal suit Blazers but overall a nice looking coat,86996,4
86998,Be carfoul ironing it.,86998,4
86999,I was very happy with my charm.,86999,4
87000,Incredible finish and awesome color.,87000,4
87000,I love the black interior and material.,87000,4
87000,Would be 5 stars but there is no resistance upon opening or closing so it can slam shut now and then.,87000,4
87000,Still don't mind it!,87000,4
87001,"It's not really what I wanted, but will keep it and give it to someone as a gift who I know will use it.",87001,4
87002,"They ride up too quick when I wear them jogging, maybe just a bit quicker than those I have from other brands of booty shorts.",87002,4
87002,The fabric is really comfortable - sizing runs a bit small.,87002,4
87003,I bought this top in several colors.,87003,4
87003,Washed a few times and no fading or shrinking which is a bonus!,87003,4
87004,style is great and what I wanted.,87004,4
87004,A bit smaller than I thought it would be so as the 4 stars.,87004,4
87005,"My girlfriend ""thought they were decent.",87005,4
87005,"Good quality and fit, but not warm like the other ones.""",87005,4
87006,Seems accurate enough so far.,87006,4
87007,Nice costum but I didn't like it when I tried it on,87007,4
87008,I definitely recommend this bathing suit.,87008,4
87008,It's super flattering and I love the design of the straps in the back and the fabric doesn't feel cheap.,87008,4
87008,"I'm 5'9"", 138 lbs and I ordered a medium and It turned out to be too big.",87008,4
87008,"Not ALOT, but definitely enough for me not to be able to wear it in the water and not loose it.",87008,4
87008,"I was kind of bummed because I really wanted it to work out, it's a pretty unique bathing suit.",87008,4
87008,So I contacted the seller and they said they would replace it for a size small!,87008,4
87008,They were nice and understanding.,87008,4
87008,I haven't received it yet but will update this review with news when I do!,87008,4
87009,"The design of the dress is lovely, but the size chart was wrong for me.",87009,4
87009,I am busty 36-D so was told to get a large.,87009,4
87009,But the large looks really big on me from the waist down.,87009,4
87009,"They actually make me look larger then I am, and that's never good.",87009,4
87009,"I usually wear a medium but because of my breast size, I got a large.",87009,4
87009,I should have gotten medium.,87009,4
87009,I will have to have the dress altered for a better fit below the waist.,87009,4
87009,"I bought a lot of these dresses too, but only wore one, because of the fit below the waist.",87009,4
87010,"very cute, but gets caught in my pillow case.",87010,4
87011,This Alpine Swiss Eva Brown Faux Shearling jacket is very light but it is very warm!,87011,4
87011,It is easy to wear daily.,87011,4
87011,"The comment for other shoppers is that this jacket is for tall less than 5.3 ft or 165 cm person(s), because somehow, it is too short.",87011,4
87015,Cute but kinda loose on the bottom,87015,4
87016,Fits great and washes nice.,87016,4
87017,This is a cute skirt.,87017,4
87017,I'm 5'9 150 and it fits just right at an XL.,87017,4
87017,I'm trying to figure out a good top to wear it with (outside of a crop top) because of the material and where it sits on my hips.,87017,4
87017,I got the beige color and it's not see through at all.,87017,4
87018,I haven't used it enough yet to see whether the color and elasticity last but so far no complaints.,87018,4
87018,I think it is too soon to award 5 stars and that's the reason for my 4 stars.,87018,4
87020,It's very pretty and fit just right.,87020,4
87020,"If you look closely you can tell it's not ""real"" but I really like it a lot.",87020,4
87023,Great customer service from the Pulla Bulla company.,87023,4

87024,They are a nice weight and I like the look.,87024,4
87024,Wish the colors were more earth tones.,87024,4
87024,They seem just a little small for my foot as I find the heels on the sole of my foot.,87024,4
87024,The packaging was very nice.,87024,4
87024,They are softer after being washed.,87024,4
87025,Looks good on me got a few compliments,87025,4
87026,"Amazing, I got it for my feriend and she loves it, super cute",87026,4
87028,LOOK LIKE GOOD QUALITY BUT HAVE NOT WORN THEM YET.,87028,4
87028,"WASHED 1ST, THEN HAD TO HEM.",87028,4
87028,TAKING 21/2 INCHES OFF.,87028,4
87028,WILL NOT DRY IN THE DRYER BECAUSE THEN THEY WILL BE TO SMALL,87028,4
87029,Like their ties for the styling and Length.,87029,4
87031,I used the sizing chart in the pictures and ended up ordering a medium in Ivory.,87031,4
87031,It fit me just like the model in the picture and I was super pleased.,87031,4
87031,It was feminine and flowy and looked super cute tucked into a pencil skirt.,87031,4
87031,I should note that I am quite tall at 5'11 and found that the sleeves were not too short and the length past the waist was perfect - THAT NEVER HAPPENS FOR US TALL GALS!,87031,4
87031,"I, unfortunately, just could not get past the static cling this type of material creates.",87031,4
87031,it made the shirt stick to me everywhere rather than keep that flowy look.,87031,4
87031,"There is a built in tank top ""lining"" for the front of the shirt and while appreciated so the shirt is not completely see through, I think that's what was causing such static issues.",87031,4
87031,I would also like to note that I initiated my return and was immediately contacted by a customer service rep to see if there was something they could do for me.,87031,4
87031,"Because of the accurate description of the sizing chart and the customer service, I would definitely love to order from this company again in the future.",87031,4
87032,This shirt is really comfortable.,87032,4
87032,"It is soft, airy, and loose just as I wanted.",87032,4

87033,would buy again as gift.,87033,4
87035,"The leatherish part is really weird to me, and the whole thing looks fairly cheap, but when I'm wearing it and glance in the mirror it looks great.",87035,4
87035,"I'm a huge Harry Potter fan, so I love it, just wish it was a bit sturdier.",87035,4
87037,"love these, but they fit somewhat small for a 2T.",87037,4
87038,I am normally an XL but after reading the reviews I ordered an XXXL and it fit great!,87038,4
87038,It is my go to Christmas Party shirt this year!,87038,4
87039,Pros: Fits as described in the reviews.,87039,4
87039,"The front is fully lined, so it adds tummy support.",87039,4
87039,"Gorgeous color and style
Cons: Cups are a little large, but with the halter neck style this shouldn't be a problem.",87039,4
87039,Material is thinner than I'd like.,87039,4
87039,I purchased a suit similar to this from another boutique website famous for retro suits and it didn't fit nearly as well.,87039,4
87039,This suit fits the way I'd hoped the other would (especially since I paid 3x the price for the last one)!,87039,4
87039,I will definitely be purchasing another color in this.,87039,4
87039,It's retro cute without being too mom-ish.,87039,4
87040,I normally wear size 4.,87040,4
87040,Had to go with Large based on other customers review.,87040,4
87040,"If you have larger than normal hip, these probably not a good fit.",87040,4
87041,"Good product, however, L found the same thing on ebay for a lot less.",87041,4
87042,"Ilike the look, fit, stretch.",87042,4
87042,The only reason I have 4* is because the seem onthe upper butt is positioned do it feels like my undiesare sighting down.,87042,4
87042,When doing yoga I don't want to bothered thinking my undies.,87042,4
87043,"I am 5 7, 145 and i ordered a large, a medium would have fit better, very nice quality.",87043,4
87044,"It isn't bad at all... it is comfortable, wish the edges were alittle more comfort fit.",87044,4
87044,However since I put it on 3 weeks ago it hasn't come off.,87044,4
87045,The only complaint is its a lot lighter of blue then the picture but other then that super super small details I absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,87045,4
87045,I can't wait to load all my stuff in it.,87045,4
87045,It came a week before it said it was going to.,87045,4
87045,Definitely worth every penny.,87045,4
87046,"Love this jacket, but had to return it, as the body of the jacket was shorter than I felt comfortable in.",87046,4
87047,I won't wear it near my dogs or where it could be snagged on a twig.,87047,4
87048,Liked the shirt just way to big.,87048,4
87049,it is a warmer fabric but fit nice and comfy,87049,4
87050,Very nice except the chain is too tiny and it's hard to open or close.,87050,4
87051,"I'm 5""11 true size16-18.",87051,4
87051,Hugs curves but comfortable,87051,4
87052,"its a good hat, just a little small",87052,4
87053,"I love the way this looks, but it's a bit big.",87053,4
87053,I didn't end up taking it on my cruise vacation because I was afraid it would blow away.,87053,4
87054,It is a little short,87054,4
87055,Ordered this for my wife and she loved it.,87055,4
87055,Appears to be good quality work.,87055,4
87057,Looks just like the picture!,87057,4
87057,And fits according to the size chart.,87057,4
87057,The colors are beautiful!,87057,4
87057,"I would love this skirt if it were 6"" longer.",87057,4
87057,"I'm 5'8"", and love ankle length skirts.",87057,4
87057,"This skirt is classic calf length, which is  nice, but not as nice for me as ankle length.",87057,4
87058,The top is a very loose at the waist and a little long it covers my bathing suit bottom.,87058,4
87058,I am 5' 115 lbs and purchased a Medium.,87058,4
87058,A small top would have fit better.,87058,4
87059,"I thought may be it would look cheap given the price, but it does not.",87059,4
87060,"This bag is very cute and the color matched pretty well in person, although I assumed the bag would have been a little smaller.",87060,4
87060,"Seems like it would get in the way for a night out, but I kept it anyway to use for as a daytime summer bag!",87060,4
87061,I like it a lot but is kind of see-through so buy a slip!,87061,4
87063,"Runs slightly big, but i like it that way when im pregnant.",87063,4
87064,The dress is actually a bit longer than originally anticipated and is a little wider at the bottom.,87064,4
87064,Nonetheless it is very cute and fits well.,87064,4
87064,The fabric is of a good quality as well.,87064,4
87065,The pouch for your Sakk  works well.,87065,4
87065,It works a little better than MyPakage underwear's version but they have softer material over all.,87065,4
87065,"Neither pair are worth $25 for just one pair but if you have the cash, definitely try them out.",87065,4
87066,Perfect size bag for toiletries.,87066,4
87067,"The only inconvenience is that the black one came a little scratched, with some silver showing, other than that its perfect.",87067,4
87068,It's a perfect blouse except the pink stripes are pretty dark for me.,87068,4
87069,well worth the money.,87069,4
87070,Seems like a quality watch.,87070,4
87070,I've had it for about 2 weeks now and it works as expected.,87070,4
87070,"It was large, but I took it to a local jeweler who removed a link in a matter of minutes for a small charge.",87070,4
87070,"The only thing I wish were different on it is the background dial, which, when looking at a very short distance, appears to not be real wood.",87070,4
87070,The rest of the watch is real wood and no one will notice this except the wearer at a super close zoom.,87070,4
87070,I am happy with it!,87070,4
87071,The only complaint I would have is about the band.,87071,4
87071,It's a bit difficult to fasten.,87071,4
87072,I bought this for my mother-in-law and she loves it.,87072,4
87073,"Very pretty but they do not stay up no backing came with them, so I took a pair from another pair of earrings but they still did not stay up;",87073,4
87075,Perfect for after my csection.,87075,4
87075,Only 4 stars because I feel it runs slightly large and has stretched out slightly.,87075,4
87076,Is a great hat but if it was a bit smaller it would fit perfectly.,87076,4
87077,"I love the dress, it's nicely made, it fits my body perfectly and it didn't take long for me to receive it.",87077,4
87077,"The only thing I will say is the bow really isn't needed, it's kind of unnecessary and it is more of a dull dark gold, wish it was more of a shiny, bright gold",87077,4
87080,I gave this to a friend she loves it,87080,4
87081,I received my dress yesterday in the mail.,87081,4
87081,The dress looks just like the picture.,87081,4
87081,I like how the fabric feels.,87081,4
87081,I give this four stars only because the length is a little short.,87081,4
87081,"I'm 5'3"" and it comes just above my ankles.",87081,4
87081,"I am also 26 weeks pregnant though, so that might play into the length a bit.",87081,4
87081,I ordered this dress for my baby shower and am fairly pleased with it.,87081,4
87082,nice-- a knock off .,87082,4
87084,Really long for a child size 14 but nothing a good friend could not fix .,87084,4
87085,Had to get a Size up,87085,4
87086,Tool pocket is right size for my very large phone.,87086,4
87086,"Con- they don't offer my waist size, 31.",87086,4
87088,Really cute but the fabric was not what I was thinking it was gonna be very thin.,87088,4
87088,"Also I read some reviews saying it fits small, not the case.",87088,4
87088,"I'm 5'5"" about 150 usually a medium & size 8 in pants so I figured getting a bigger size cause of my hips but it was a mistake, should of gone with a medium, would of exchanged it but the medium wasn't prime so wouldn't come in time for me.",87088,4
87089,It is so large,87089,4
87090,"It's a little small, but functional and CUTE!",87090,4
87091,"Somewhat small, however absolutely love it!",87091,4
87092,I personally have too much backside to wear this as a dress but it makes a good long too with leggings!,87092,4
87093,My daughter likes this watch.,87093,4
87093,She thinks it looks cute and wanted to know if she could wear it to bed.,87093,4
87093,I said - sure!,87093,4
87093,The only reason I'm not giving the watch 5 stars is because of the instructions that came with the watch - not clear.,87093,4
87093,I found the instructions online - they worked great:  [...],87093,4
87095,its a great hat just what i was looking for just a little tight the tan hat is just to big,87095,4
87096,Nice simple pair of glasses.,87096,4
87098,I was surprised that I'd like this dress so much.,87098,4
87098,The fit is good...I could have stood to go down one size only because Im in the process of losing weight (I got the XL) but it looks nice all the same.,87098,4
87098,Lightweight flowing material that drapes your body.,87098,4
87098,Really happy with my purchase.,87098,4
87099,I needed a watch strap for a watch like my Pebble Time which has charging connectors on the bottom.,87099,4
87099,"A proper ""NATO style"" band actually covers the bottom of the watch.",87099,4
87099,"They are tougher and hold better under extreme strain I'm sure, but it's rare that anyone really runs into this problem (and they're still reliant on those spring connectors in the end, so that's the real weakest link here no matter what you use.",87099,4
87099,Those just help spread out some of the strain on those points a tiny bit.),87099,4
87099,"However, this band isn't true ""NATO style"" and works more like an ordinary band in this respect.",87099,4
87099,"Instead of covering the bottom, it just connects directly via the spring connectors to the watch like an ordinary band.",87099,4
87099,This means it won't block any chargers that a normal band wouldn't block (so as far as I know that means basically any charger is safe period.,87099,4
87099,Even some tiny thing going in where the bands go should fit through if it works with a normal band at all.),87099,4
87099,The only thing I don't like about the band is it is very very stiff.,87099,4
87099,"This makes it sit a bit loosely at times, though since most bands (including my original one) don't have half-sizes on them, it's hard for any not to be at least a bit loose.",87099,4
87099,Perhaps this even makes it hold a bit better -- it's hard to say.,87099,4
87099,"At first it was kind of uncomfortable, but once it was broken in a bit it has been fine.",87099,4
87099,"I find it to be more comfortable than the original silicone bands, though it's a matter of preference in this respect.",87099,4
87099,"As expected of a NATO style band, the band holds on well without sticking out and catching on things though -- which was the primary reason I bought it.",87099,4
87099,"Ironically the stiffness helps here even more, though it's mostly the use of two rings to hold it in place.",87099,4
87099,The original band was always catching on things and with this one I haven't once had this problem.,87099,4
87099,I broke out the ruler and confirmed in case it helps anyone:  it is almost exactly 22mm.,87099,4
87099,Maybe 21.5 or so at the smallest (my ruler isn't quite this precise.),87099,4
87099,It absolutely will not fit a 20mm spot as some claiming to be 22mm will do.,87099,4
87100,This was good quality.,87100,4
87100,definitely worth the money and the  Beads didn't look cheap.,87100,4
87101,Good fit but a bit small.,87101,4
87102,I got this for my husband - the quality of the shirt and screen printing are very good.,87102,4
87102,"My husband normally wears a XL, but the manufacturer said the shirts were unisex sizes and if you wanted a little roomier fit to order a size up.",87102,4
87102,So I ordered a XXL for him and it was a little too big but we kept it knowing that after lots of washing and drying there is a chance that it can shrink.,87102,4
87102,So just be aware of that if you do order a size up.,87102,4
87103,small as i expected for the size,87103,4
87104,These are adorable and I always get compliments when my daughter wears them.,87104,4
87104,Please make sure to never wash them because they do fall apart since it's only tied together.,87104,4
87105,gave as a gift and he loved it,87105,4
87106,I was surprised it came out EXACTLY as the one in the picture.,87106,4
87106,It was beautiful but not what I was looking for for the occasion.,87106,4
87107,Good quality nice looking top.,87107,4
87107,I get compliments when I wear it.,87107,4
87108,It seemed a little small,87108,4
87109,My brother love this watch and it came sooner than expected,87109,4
87110,Great casual top to go with jeans,87110,4
87111,Nice little purse and can hold most of my items I need.,87111,4
87111,I didn't want to give 5stars because its already starting to tear when the closure/button is on the front.,87111,4
87113,Liked product but it is very itchy,87113,4
87114,I got this hat to get a little more color variety to the two Epoch ivy caps that I had.,87114,4
87114,All in all it's a very nice hat for the price.,87114,4
87114,"I think I have an average size head for an adult man, and it fits me fine.",87114,4
87114,"However, there is not much stretch in the elastic, so if my head was much larger or smaller it wouldn't fit well.",87114,4
87114,"Also, it sticks out a touch more on the sides, but I guess that's a matter of taste.",87114,4
87114,"It's a good hat, but I have a slight preference for the Epoch hats for fit and function.",87114,4
87114,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-s-6-Panel-Linen-Duckbill-Ivy-Hat-With-Summer-Low-Cut-Sock-DARK-GREY/dp/B01G0VQ5XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men's 6 Panel Linen Duckbill Ivy Hat With Summer Low Cut Sock(DARK GREY)</a>

The lining is a light material in green (at least for the green hat), and there is a foamy type material lining the front of the cap.",87114,4
87117,The item came on time.,87117,4
87117,Two of the shirts had holes where the stitching was not complete.,87117,4
87118,"They're gorgeous socks, but were way too small for my husband's size 10 feet.",87118,4
87118,"He stretched them and got them on, though, and they're ok.",87118,4
87118,It just took about five minutes of stretching and pulling to get them on the first time.,87118,4
87118,Some pairs were tighter than others.,87118,4
87119,This fits really well.,87119,4
87120,Better quality than I expected.,87120,4
87120,My daughter loves this dress.,87120,4
87121,Just received these gloves and they look like they will be great.,87121,4
87121,I have small women's hands and I ordered and received a size small and they fit well.,87121,4
87121,Fit was my biggest concern.,87121,4
87121,They arrived in the mail in a timely time.,87121,4
87121,"I haven't worn them in the cold yet, so it is still to be determined how warm they are, but they look warm.",87121,4
87122,"Made for a cheap, easy, and unique halloween costume.",87122,4
87122,I may have given my toddler nightmares with it.,87122,4
87122,Inside comfort foam and eye coverings fell off during shipping.,87122,4
87122,Flexible enough for some shaping.,87122,4
87122,It won't hold up to much abuse.,87122,4
87123,well made and delivers upon it's promise.,87123,4
87123,the canopy is not as large as i'd want it to be but it is durable enough and can sustain a good load of wind.,87123,4
87123,For those commenting about strong winds - i really really don't see the point in using an umbrella when it's so windy outside... other than struggling with keeping it upright - you will not manage to keep yourself dry no matter how well your umbrella is constructed.,87123,4
87123,use a storm suit if you want to go outside in a stormy weather.,87123,4
87126,They are very cute.the actual length is good but they are pretty wide.,87126,4
87127,I was looking for something to match the earrings I bought and this matched perfectly.,87127,4
87127,"It's bright, beautiful, and shiny.",87127,4
87127,"As others have mentioned, it's very fitted; my wrist is 6in around and it fits nicely, but I don't see it stretching too far past anyone with a 7"" wrist.",87127,4
87127,"Although I love it, I had to remove one star, since it arrived with a rhinestone missing.",87127,4
87128,It has given me some additional confidence about credit card security.,87128,4
87128,"I wish it was just a tiny bit wider so I could
also put some cash in it also, along with my license.",87128,4
87129,I'm still getting used to it but I like the fact it is super thin.,87129,4
87129,"I used a tri-fold for years so it's awkward trying to put bill back in at the register with anything in your hands, but that is just me getting used to it more than anything.",87129,4
87129,I'm not a big fan of not being able to see anything but the top card but that is the trade off for the space and layout.,87129,4
87130,Material is somewhat itchy but fits perfectly.,87130,4
87132,It is actually better then in the picture.,87132,4
87133,I just purchased the wrong size.,87133,4
87134,Fit nice they are bigger then I expected,87134,4
87135,Runs small so order large.,87135,4
87135,I am 126lbs and wear a size 4/6.,87135,4
87135,The only bad thing is it shows through clothing (deep seams).,87135,4
87136,One stone fell out before I put them on but I wore them anyway and don't think anyone noticed.,87136,4
87136,:-) Great value also.,87136,4
87137,"Too big for me, so had to return it.",87137,4
87138,"Si normalmente vistes size M, deben pedirlo large.",87138,4
87139,Look like the picture.,87139,4
87139,Have not used it yet.,87139,4
87140,I bought this for a weekend trip.,87140,4
87140,Fit everything we needed for walking around (including an extra pair of flip flops) and several pockets for organization.,87140,4
87140,My only criticism is that the zippers are plastic and not metal.,87140,4
87140,"They tend to get ""caught up"" if not aligned properly.",87140,4
87140,"Otherwise, it's definitely a keeper!",87140,4
87142,Baby is due in October not sure how they fit or if they fall off.,87142,4
87142,"However, I love how soft they feel.",87142,4
87142,The only thing I didn't like was the sticker that was on one of each row.,87142,4
87142,"But other than that, they are simple and beautiful!",87142,4
87143,Very cute...just too poopy for me!,87143,4
87144,"Very comfortable, very opaque.",87144,4
87144,"These won't keep you warm, but they offer coverage for your legs in different layered looks.",87144,4
87144,I like them and I'll be ordering more colors.,87144,4
87144,I wear a size 12 pants and these fit just fine.,87144,4
87144,I think almost any size could fit in these.,87144,4
87144,These are really more tights than leggings.,87144,4
87144,I wouldn't wear these without something else over my butt.,87144,4
87144,"I tend to wear them with shorts or dresses, but never alone like pants.",87144,4
87144,"In the photos, I am wearing them alone with a black shirt so you can see (through the shirt) how high waisted they are and how they look alone, but normally I'm wearing shorts like in the other photo or dresses or something.",87144,4
87146,Met expectations of purchase.,87146,4
87147,"They are one size and I'm large, so they are stretched out.",87147,4
87147,"I bought them for a Halloween costume, so they will work!",87147,4
87147,Just glad I found some yellow leggings and they arrived before the 31st!,87147,4
87148,Good product and the price is reasonable,87148,4
87149,"It's nice in almost everything, the only issue is quite smaller for my wife",87149,4
87150,And fits great tough somewhat tight on the armpits and sleeves.,87150,4
87150,Otherwise like it very much!,87150,4
87151,This is a really beautiful winter sweater romper.,87151,4
87151,"On the occasion that my son wore it, he received many compliments.",87151,4
87151,"Unfortunately, it tore right after I washed it.",87151,4
87151,Why am I giving it four stars anyway?,87151,4
87151,Because I contacted the company's customer service and they offered me a refund or replacement right away.,87151,4
87151,"Subsequently, I would be very comfortable ordering this item or other clothing from this company again.",87151,4
87152,"Not the material i was expecting, but works hust the same",87152,4
87153,It looked and fit as shown,87153,4
87154,"I like it,its cool",87154,4
87155,Loved it the 1st time but color fades fast!,87155,4
87156,"Really, really cute but the satin unwinds very easily so all that is left is the plastic white headband.",87156,4
87157,This 22mm band did not fit my 22mm Skagen watch.,87157,4
87157,Do not buy this band if you have a Skagen watch.,87157,4
87157,"The band itself is nice looking and seems solid for the price, and it did not take too long to arrive, it simply doesn't work for some Skagen mesh watches.",87157,4
87158,I read the other comments about these running large but I still overestimated what size to get.,87158,4
87158,We'll have to wait until next year to really use them.,87158,4
87158,The only thing I noticed on our trial runs was that the velcro patch on the back of the glove which holds the mitten top open/off the fingers would grab any slack fabric/folds.,87158,4
87158,"So because these were too big and the mitten top didn't fit snugly, it was constantly getting pulled back/open onto the velcro.",87158,4
87160,Product is good but was shipped to the wrong place first,87160,4
87161,A bit more purple-ish than plum,87161,4
87162,I get lots of compliments.,87162,4
87162,One arm was a little tighter than the other though but other than that it fits great.,87162,4
87163,My mom loved her shirt.,87163,4
87163,We love Days of Our Lives!,87163,4
87164,the chain is already rusty but i still like it its cute!,87164,4
87165,My only complaint is that the invisible zipper malfunctioned after wearing it a few times.,87165,4
87165,"I have had this problem with invisible zippers with a few dresses, from all different designers, I don't really think it detracts from the quality of this dress.",87165,4
87166,"Bought these  for someone else, but they seem to be satisfied.",87166,4
87167,I love the quality of the fabric doesn't get wrinkled easily and the fit is loose around the hip area perfect for the gym or as a layering piece under a sweater or shirt carelessly tucked in or relaxed look.,87167,4
87167,I am 5ft 105 Lbs petite and I love the way it shows off my upper back when I workout.,87167,4
87167,"Shipment was prompt and yes, I ordered 3 in a small no regrets.",87167,4
87167,I haven't washed it yet so we shall see.,87167,4
87167,Oh I would definitely wear it for night out with denim skinny jeans or dressy shorts.,87167,4
87167,Update: it did shrink slightly after wash and dryer 10/22/16,87167,4
87169,Comfortable and looks great!,87169,4
87169,"I think each sweatshirt might have different characters on it, or be formatted differently, but I still like mine a lot!",87169,4
87170,"The black part of the heel is durable, but the beigh part is easily torn if it scrapes against anything.",87170,4
87172,"The dress is very long so I had to get it tailored a bit on the bottom and take it in by the shoulders otherwise the dress fit perfectly,  if you don't know your size I would suggest getting measured before you buy.",87172,4
87173,But for the money it is very nice.,87173,4
87173,Worked for a Mardi Gras event we attended.,87173,4
87174,This is very cute and seems to be breathable and of good quality!,87174,4
87174,I would definitely recommend for working out or just as a comfortable zip-up hoodie to wear around the house.,87174,4
87174,It did fit slightly smaller than I expected (I generally wear a small and this was on the cusp of being TOO small).,87174,4
87174,"However, I think it will stretch some with wear so I will be keeping it!",87174,4
87176,the Sleeves are a little short but the Dress is HOTTTT!,87176,4
87176,it was for a company holiday party on a boat cruise so cute and stylist,87176,4
87177,Really nice item the bottom was a Lil too big.,87177,4
87177,Need 1 size smaller stretches.,87177,4
87177,The top is not secure moves a lot.,87177,4
87178,We have a big boy but compared to other items listed at this size it seems a little small.,87178,4
87178,He is a 7 month old wearing 12 to 18 month clothes and is not fat.,87178,4
87179,Really like these pants.,87179,4
87179,Have had same brand before and they look good and last.,87179,4
87180,Decent purse for the price!,87180,4
87180,"Got it in pink and the color looked nice, not as pink online, more muted in color.",87180,4
87182,Be prepared to put it on another chain or a piece of leather,87182,4
87183,it is a nice swim suit.,87183,4
87183,it isn't well made and the bottoms are very cheeky!,87183,4
87184,"Love the colors an the amount , great price.",87184,4
87185,"Loved the dress, but the measurements are way off.",87185,4
87185,It's a beautiful flowing gown.,87185,4
87185,Add a petticoat or long hoop skirt and it will fill out around the bottom.,87185,4
87186,"Nice cushioning, moderate arch support.",87186,4
87186,Fits well in my size 10 women's shoes.,87186,4
87187,These are identical to the photo.,87187,4
87187,They are super cute.,87187,4
87187,"Either they run a little tiny bit large or maybe my daughter has tiny feet, either way they are still cute!",87187,4
87188,These undershirts have changed since I last purchased them at Norstrom over a year ago.,87188,4
87188,"New shirts appear to be a different cotton blend that is slightly thicker, not as soft, and has a bluish tint to it.",87188,4
87188,Not a deal breaker for me since I wear them as an undershirt.,87188,4
87188,"Overall quality has gone down a bit, but would grade them at a B/B+.",87188,4
87188,I will research other brands next time I need to re-up on undershirts.,87188,4
87188,"Overall not a bad option, but not what they once were.",87188,4
87189,Ordered for a friend.,87189,4
87189,She said they fit perfect and wers completely comfortable,87189,4
87191,This is a very pretty bracelet.,87191,4
87191,It is a Christmas gift and I'm sure she will love it.,87191,4
87191,I just need to get a little box for it because it does not come with any sort of packaging.,87191,4
87192,These fit fine and feel fine but on the back where the moon is imprinted you can see through to your underwear.,87192,4
87192,White underwear can help avoid some of this issue but it would be better if they were a bit thicker.,87192,4
87193,The leg part fit a little big but other than that it's perfect,87193,4
87194,wasn't the size I needed,87194,4
87196,"the shank is a bit short but as a whole it's very comfortable, well made, and is really pretty to wear.",87196,4
87197,These are good decent fleece pants.,87197,4
87197,Quality is great and fit is good except in length.,87197,4
87197,They are very long.,87197,4
87197,"My husband is 6""2"" and usually buys tall pants, but these are about six inches too long.",87197,4
87197,"Unless you are about 6'5"" or taller, don't get the tall.",87197,4
87197,"Otherwise, these are nice pants.",87197,4
87199,It was a birthday gift for a 16 yr old girl,87199,4
87200,"Well made and love the colors, but it is a bit small.",87200,4
87200,"Normally my son wears a 2X, with this he needed a 5x.",87200,4
87201,Would be 5 stars if it was not quite so slim fitting in the arms and shoulders and chest.,87201,4
87201,"Not sure what makes it a 42, really.....",87201,4
87201,Wish they had a 43!,87201,4
87202,I bought the magenta.,87202,4
87202,It was almost perfect.,87202,4
87202,The only downfall is that the color bleeds.,87202,4
87202,Luckily I had washed it with some towels we used and it turned them blotchy hot pink.,87202,4
87202,This happens for the first three washes,87202,4
87203,Nice fit and feel.,87203,4
87203,I'd buy these again.,87203,4
87203,Took off one star because I think the elastic could be a little wider/softer: It is narrow and sometimes feels as if it's cutting into the skin a little bit.,87203,4
87204,Very happy with the quality for the price,87204,4
87205,"It's more of a chocolate brown with a rosy undertone, very pretty.",87205,4
87205,The ribbon is sturdy and not dainty.,87205,4
87205,I wish these would have been the right shade of brown for the shoe I wanted to use them in!,87205,4
87206,LOVED THIS OUTFIT BUT I ONLY BOUGHT FOR HALLOWEEN WHICH I WASN'T REALLY ABLE TO WEAR DUE TO AN UNSCHEDULED EVENT.,87206,4
87207,"Beautiful urn, love the kitty, well made, however the ash depository is really shallow and I couldn't get very many ashes into it.",87207,4
87207,"I was able to get a very small amount into it so I still have Raja close to my heart, just wish that I could have put more in.",87207,4
87209,Love the fabric and wear.,87209,4
87209,They fit too small in the legs for me so I had to buy a size bigger than expected.,87209,4
87211,This shirt is awesome for the nerds in all of us.,87211,4
87211,I've gotten several compliments on it when I've been out and about.,87211,4
87211,"The color is a little lighter shade of burgundy than i was expecting but it wasn't ""salmon"" or anything like that.",87211,4
87211,"My biggest gripe is that the ""tail"" seems too long for my taste.",87211,4
87211,I'm not real big on shirts that hang below the pockets of my pants.,87211,4
87211,"This one seems that it could use about 1-2"" less of material down there.",87211,4
87211,"other than that, it's a must have for avid Alien fans.",87211,4
87212,"Pretty see-through, but should be good with something else under.",87212,4
87214,"Ordered a large, but should have gotten a medium.",87214,4
87214,I will need to wear another cami/tank under this because the arm openings are much too big for me.,87214,4
87214,"Not a deal breaker, but would rather not have to layer my summer clothes.",87214,4
87214,"For reference I am 5'6"", average build, aprox 140 lb.",87214,4
87214,Hope that helps future buyers.,87214,4
87215,The costume overall is great except for the mask.,87215,4
87215,Poor visibility and breathability makes you keep it off or replace it.,87215,4
87216,Love this shirt ..It is a tad small but still wearable and of good quality.,87216,4
87217,"A perfect fit, very happy with the quality and the price.",87217,4
87218,Looked great on my lady and it was comfortable.,87218,4
87218,"If sexy is the look you're going for, I recommend this highly.",87218,4
87219,"The top is a purple color not a royal blue, but it's still cute and soft so I'll keep it.",87219,4
87219,The V-neck cuts pretty deep so I should have worn a tank underneath it when I went to work.,87219,4
87219,It would also be great for moms who breastfeed.,87219,4
87219,Cool summer work or anytime shirt!,87219,4
87219,Would have given 5 stars if I knew it was purple not blue.,87219,4
87220,Much smaller than I thought they would be but I'm wearing them.,87220,4
87221,a litter big than my size,87221,4
87222,"Really itchy, but I guess that's to be expected with any wig.",87222,4
87222,"There were some loose hairs after wearing it once, but you couldn't tell by looking at it.",87222,4
87222,It is very full and a nice color of gray,87222,4
87223,Came in one piece... not broken!,87223,4
87224,"Heavy material, fit seems to be on point.",87224,4
87224,I will order again for sure.,87224,4
87225,Was slightly snug but I think I underestimated  my size.,87225,4
87225,Great quality but itchy tag lol,87225,4
87226,"The graphic feels very thick, almost like an iron on.",87226,4
87226,"Don't think it is, but we'll have to see how it holds up to repeated washings.",87226,4
87228,Nice and a good price.,87228,4
87229,4 stars because these are definitely see-thru!!,87229,4
87229,"Fit well and are very comfortable but if you're looking for leggings that are not see through.,..",87229,4
87229,These are not the ones.,87229,4
87229,I like that they are a little shiny and thin material... Quality seems good so far.,87229,4
87230,Doesn't want to sit right.,87230,4
87231,Duracell Coppertop batteries last longer than most other batteries I've used.,87231,4
87231,The AA batteries are good through Mar.,87231,4
87231,The AAA batteries are good through Mar.,87231,4
87231,Both sets are made in China.,87231,4
87231,No gift was included.,87231,4
87232,Very pretty dress but was to big and need to return it,87232,4
87233,"Great fit I am only taking 1 star away because it shows more cleavage than I'd like (I am a 38C), but I am modest.",87233,4
87234,"Order, received, used, okay",87234,4
87235,It is very comfortable and soft...BUT I find it kind of form fitting...meaning it does cling to your every curve- like saddlebags!,87235,4
87235,"So, sure if you're nice and non curvy like the model, it fits flowy and nice.",87235,4
87235,"Otherwise, expect it to follow the lines of your shape...",87235,4
87236,I wear 36 jeans and these XL briefs fit well.,87236,4
87237,Perfect addition for my daughters Minecraft birthday party outfit.,87237,4
87237,"It runs larger than I expected, but that's fine because she can wear it for a longer time",87237,4
87238,One of the gems fell off.,87238,4
87238,But this piece is extremely pretty.,87238,4
87239,This dress has a loose fitting without the sloppy look.,87239,4
87240,Cute for a summer casual look.,87240,4
87240,"Fabric is a bit thin, unlined, so I wore nude undergarments and Spanx.",87240,4
87240,(You can see the line of my strapless bra).,87240,4
87240,Other than that - like it!,87240,4
87241,"It says slip-ons but I received ones with shoelaces which I guess I don't really care about too much, especially for the given price.",87241,4
87241,Delivery was beyond fast!,87241,4
87241,Ordered them on a Friday afternoon and was surprised to get them on Monday.,87241,4
87242,"A little too thin, but useable",87242,4
87243,Took off a star because a pom pom fell off after third use.,87243,4
87243,But I still love them to pieces and they even look good without pom poms.,87243,4
87243,Perhaps I'll stick another on.,87243,4
87244,the band is too big for me but my wrist is small so...,87244,4
87246,"Cool color, soft, sturdy but not stiff knit..and so cheap!",87246,4
87247,But I wish I had an identical pair with a narrow seat and a tan lined pouch to wear at the pool/beach !,87247,4
87247,VERY low in front : shaving is a must !,87247,4
87247,"Barely get my tools in on some pairs - all pouches not same size, slight diffs.",87247,4
87247,Great for summer or winter.,87247,4
87247,Fabric holes WILL let your ball skin push through with long wearing.,87247,4
87248,"My daughter used this bag, we didn't like carrying this bag with the large handle but otherwise it was a pretty good purchase.",87248,4
87249,good for sensitive skin coverage against the sun,87249,4
87250,This will be perfect with my 1920s flapper dress.,87250,4
87251,"it came in 2 pieces, the circle piece fell off, glad i found it in the bag so i got my tools and put it back together, other wise its cute...looks like picture",87251,4
87252,My wife loves the fit and the retro styling - I certainly agree.,87252,4
87253,Not my style but the product looked exactly like shown in the picture.,87253,4
87253,A bit cheap looking but come on for the price that's an invalid argument.,87253,4
87253,I think it's gorgeous.,87253,4
87254,I think its a cool hat - the wife thinks I look stupid - I don't wear it around her -- still like it,87254,4
87255,"These dresses will all get 4 stars from me because of the great style, high quality (if not the most desirable) fabric, good construction and GREAT pricing.",87255,4
87255,"However, they do have their drawbacks.",87255,4
87255,"--Material: It's a slick polyester, really too heavy for summer wear (in a summer dress), rather like a lightweight swimsuit material--I don't care for it at all but just can't pass up the dresses at the price.",87255,4
87255,"--Sizing: Despite the stretchiness, IMO, dress is about one size too small.",87255,4
87255,"I've got a pear-shaped body and am usually a US size 2X/20 in UK and European clothing, 3X in Torrid and most clothing made in China--plus sizing seems to be all over the place, there is no standard.",87255,4
87255,But I did figure 3X in these dresses would fit well.,87255,4
87255,"Not so--a little too snug for my liking across the waist and stomach area, although plenty full through the hips.",87255,4
87255,One other thing--I was glad I bought several colors because some were cut a little larger than others and did fit great.,87255,4
87255,--Also wish the neck were cut a little lower like their tank-style dresses.,87255,4
87255,"--Length is too long--a couple of inches below the knee if you're under 5' 4"".",87255,4
87255,"--Unless the dress is offered in Prime, it can take up to 3 weeks to be delivered (from Hong Kong).",87255,4
87256,Great for summer &  lounging  around the house.,87256,4
87257,"Not the best quality, but it's very comfy and adds to any outfit.",87257,4
87257,"More sheer than it looks in the photos, but still a good purchase, especially for the price.",87257,4
87258,I really LVE this dress!!!,87258,4
87258,As you can see in the picture it fits small.,87258,4
87258,So I usually wear it as a top but it has some stretch & absolutely be worn as a mini dress!,87258,4
87259,my little girl loved it really nice quality...,87259,4
87260,"Looks slick, does what it says.",87260,4
87260,"When I bought the wallet, I wanted something closer to a credit card size - this meets that perfectly.",87260,4
87260,The only room for improvement would be finding a way to squeeze a bit more cards inside + cash.,87260,4
87260,"Other than that, the wallet is great.",87260,4
87260,This is perfect for those who don't carry over 6 cards (don't forget your ID).,87260,4
87261,Got this as a gift for a baby shower more or less a gag gift.,87261,4
87262,It's good to war with top,87262,4
87263,Expected it to be a bit longer.,87263,4
87263,Also would have been nicer if the V was a bit lower.,87263,4
87263,Other than that nice shirt,87263,4
87264,"A bit small and very see through, wish I would have got a bigger size.",87264,4
87265,"New the item ran very small, if you're looking for a us medium I would go XXL.",87265,4
87265,"I wear a medium and chose XL still ran a little snug, besides that the quality is pretty good and it's a nice look.",87265,4
87266,Holds about eight cards.,87266,4
87266,I wish it would hold more than one card in each slot.,87266,4
87266,Overall works great and is bulky in my pocket,87266,4
87267,Super cute and made well!,87267,4
87267,The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the top is so thin it's see through but it's still a very cute outfit,87267,4
87269,It's a great skirt.,87269,4
87269,Just fits over my butt and is a little loose at the waist.,87269,4
87269,"I have more of a Kardashian shape, so considering this has no zipper, it's a damn good fit.",87269,4
87269,Still is appropriate to wear at the office.,87269,4
87269,Not too short or too tight.,87269,4
87270,Its just longer than I expected.,87270,4
87271,I bought these before and will buy them again.,87271,4
87271,No show protection for your feet and for your footwear.,87271,4
87272,Doesn't glow as bright as I thought but was pretty.,87272,4
87273,It fits well and lays nicely.,87273,4
87273,Obly problem is the fabric is balling,87273,4
87275,Material was a bit more dressy than I was looking for but they were nice and breezy,87275,4
87276,"nice product, well made, by mistake we ordered XL but Dear lovers have a great customer service, answered prontly and managed the problem very kindly.",87276,4
87277,Little tight around scrotum.,87277,4
87277,All in all a nice look!,87277,4
87278,The sleeve is a little large.,87278,4
87278,Otherwise it fit as expected.,87278,4
87280,"I thought it was cotton, perhaps I should've read details better.",87280,4
87280,"Nonetheless, it's a nice shirt.",87280,4
87282,It was really big but I loved it !,87282,4
87284,This is my second one after my first was stolen.,87284,4
87284,It is well made and i love the design.,87284,4
87284,The only thing i dislike is that one of the bill pockets is deeper than the other and this creates a noticeable bend in the exterior leather.,87284,4
87285,My daughter wanted this for a birthday gift.,87285,4
87285,It's really beautiful and she's very happy with it.,87285,4
87287,"I like the product, the only thing is that it doesn't stay in its place and you have to accommodate it trough the day...",87287,4
87288,Wish it came smaller.,87288,4
87289,I got the wrong print but ended up liking it so much I kept it anyway.,87289,4
87291,"These are so cute, but quality isn't awesome.",87291,4
87291,Had to do a little stitching after two wears.,87291,4
87292,Product meets expectations for me.,87292,4
87292,Durability over time remains to be determined.,87292,4
87294,"These are very pretty, but I can''t get them to stay up.",87294,4
87294,They fall back down and nothing I can do has fixed the issue.,87294,4
87294,"Oh, well, still pretty & I had just wanted to experiment with ear vines/ear cuffs.",87294,4
87295,It is somewhat small and I am a P size.,87295,4
87295,"However, the quality is okay my only criticism is that the size could have more options.",87295,4
87299,This case suits my phone perfectly and so far it seems very durable.,87299,4
87299,I like the protective silicone casing and that it stands for easy viewing.,87299,4
87300,Daughter loved it for her newborn.,87300,4
87300,"A little pricey because it has wolves on it, but that's what she wanted.",87300,4
87301,Bought a size 14 (Asian sizing) for my 11 year old daughter .,87301,4
87301,It is a bit big on her but she likes it.,87301,4
87301,Shipped directly from China.,87301,4
87302,Runs a bit small,87302,4
87303,I needed this dress for a 1920s New Years Eve party and it worked out great!,87303,4
87303,The other reviews are correct about sizing; go one up from what you normally wear.,87303,4
87303,"I'm 5'4"" and measure 38, 28, 40.",87303,4
87303,"I usually wear a medium and went with a large for this, and it fit great.",87303,4
87303,"You get what you pay for in terms of fabric quality, but that was just fine for a one-night event.",87303,4
87304,it came different from the pictures but I don't mind :) it also has good fabric material it's orange and white stripped,87304,4
87305,The stated description says these are for 100s.,87305,4
87305,These are longer than that and as a result take up more space than needed.,87305,4
87305,I have no other problems with it.,87305,4
87306,Would prefer a slightly smaller buckle.,87306,4
87306,"Excellent company follow-up to ensure customer satisfaction, and fast shipping.",87306,4
87306,Will buy from them again.,87306,4
87308,I wear a 32C-D while nursing and this fit well.,87308,4
87308,It is some room for engorgement or being slightly larger in the early morning.,87308,4
87308,Not a high impact bra at all but for low impact or lifting weights great bra.,87308,4
87309,This is fun and comfortable.,87309,4
87310,Love the stripes and the big fish :),87310,4
87311,runs a bit large.,87311,4
87311,Sleeves are nice and long.,87311,4
87311,Material feels soft and shirt looks well made.,87311,4
87311,I wore it to work and had many compliments.,87311,4
87311,Color is true to picture.,87311,4
87311,I ordered the wine colored shirt.,87311,4
87312,I wore it for the entire day after it arrived.,87312,4
87312,It's soft & comfy.,87312,4
87312,It is the cheaper material but I like it because it's light.,87312,4
87312,"I'm 5'4 & it covered my belly button but you could still see the hanging charm from my belly button ring, I like it but I don't know about after washing it.",87312,4
87312,Don't like how tight the neckline is though.,87312,4
87313,"Love the bottoms, fits as expected, however the top kind of spreads my boobs apart rather than where they should be or up.",87313,4
87314,It is very good.,87314,4
87315,I was pleasantly surprised that this fit as expected.,87315,4
87315,I ended up ordering the size I would normally wear rather than sizing up.,87315,4
87315,I think the drawstring at the waist helps.,87315,4
87315,"I wouldn't wear it as a dress, but it works well with leggings.",87315,4
87316,"The Cross is very nice, however the cord is shorter and thinner than I thought it would be.",87316,4
87317,I took the other reviewers advice and got a bigger size.,87317,4
87317,The dress fit like a glove but my breast are too big!,87317,4
87317,I purchased this dress for my wedding and I love it!!!,87317,4
87317,"With me having ginormous breasts (lol), it took a while to zip the side up.",87317,4
87317,"But never the less, people were complementing me left to right on the dress.",87317,4
87318,Comfortable washes up nicely cute with leggings,87318,4
87319,Very cute suit for the price!!,87319,4
87319,"Bottom fits perfectly , and top also but tends to move so you can maybe pop out depending on your bust size.",87319,4
87319,I wouldn't recommend for busty  women or you'll be busting out of this top.,87319,4
87319,"Material is really nice, so is the pattern.",87319,4
87319,Great suit for the price,87319,4
87320,Fit the boot perfectly.,87320,4
87320,Sizing was spot on.,87320,4
87321,Less not expecting that but still like.,87321,4
87322,The top ran a little too big and the bottoms and the bottoms ran a little small.,87322,4
87323,"Such a pretty top, and slimming.",87323,4
87325,It is a nice skirt and it fit!,87325,4
87325,I received compliment from people.,87325,4
87325,The material is good.,87325,4
87325,"After washing it from the washer,  I hang dry it and no need to iron!",87325,4
87326,Is nice but this top stain my skin even after two washes still doing it.,87326,4
87326,I had to scrub my skin hard in the shower to make it go away.,87326,4
87327,"sort of ""costumey"" but very very cute.. nice fit",87327,4
87329,"Nice socks, good to wear with a dress pants, a little on a thin side.",87329,4
87329,"Not as soft as expected, but it didn't bother me.",87329,4
87330,I bought three different styles from the same company.,87330,4
87330,Love all of them.,87330,4
87331,Went 2 sizes up as people recommended and it fit great.,87331,4
87332,I'm happy with how the socks fit my feet.,87332,4
87332,"my preference is for longer socks, but these are not bad,  I have a size 11.5 foot",87332,4
87333,Arrived fast I like it but I don't feel like it goes with anything.,87333,4
87333,Some of threads are already coming loose.,87333,4
87334,The material is really soft and comfortable and the fit is good too.,87334,4
87334,I'm usually a medium but I ordered up to a large and it fit just right.,87334,4
87335,"It's more like the ""Fit as hoped"", I had purchased some other items similar to this one, they were both very, very, very small.",87335,4
87335,Since when does a size labeled 3x fit a size eight?,87335,4
87335,"Because I ordered them all at the same time, I didn't know how things would be with this one after two disapointments.",87335,4
87335,I am happy to report no disappointment with this one!,87335,4
87335,I do love it and will happily wear it!,87335,4
87335,"I like it with a white tee underneath, which enhances the colors beautifully!",87335,4
87336,I am a size 12 and found the XL fit well.,87336,4
87336,This is a very warm and comfortable sweater.,87336,4
87336,My only negatives are:  1) beware the location of the pockets if you are sensitive to appearing wide in the hip; and 2) the material holds odor.,87336,4
87336,"While I understand synthetic materials hold odors more than natural fabrics, this sweater did not respond to things like a fabric refresher or washing, so I ended up using Nature's Miracle (an enzymatic cleaner) and that worked like a charm.",87336,4
87337,Looks good but may be a little big for petite body,87337,4
87339,This hat is great!,87339,4
87339,Just wish the material was a little better quality but for $9 this hat is a good buy,87339,4
87340,This shirt runs true to size.,87340,4
87340,Good color yet after 1 washing.,87340,4
87341,"Very audrey like, just what we were going for",87341,4
87342,"Love those look, a bit tight behind the ears, but.",87342,4
87342,I have a large head.,87342,4
87343,Buy your usual size.,87343,4
87343,Perfect size pouch for avg size cock/balls guy.,87343,4
87343,"Soft nylon fabric, not hot in summer.",87343,4
87343,Ive bought 16 prs.,87343,4
87344,It was pretty comfy.,87344,4
87344,"However, the bottoms were bigger than I expected.",87344,4
87344,The top was bigger but you can tie it tighter to make it wor .,87344,4
87345,I bought this for my mom and she loves it,87345,4
87346,Great fit and very comfortable.,87346,4
87347,I ordered this in white and it is pretty see through.,87347,4
87348,"Very slightly see through, but that could be just because it's a little tight for me.",87348,4
87348,"Love this dress though, very comfy.",87348,4
87348,I wear it to work so it's really not very noticeably see through.,87348,4
87349,"This is one of the softest materials I've felt, but it does shed upon washing.",87349,4
87349,Sizes run pretty big.,87349,4
87349,"My adult son is a medium (5'10"", 145#) and it almost fit me (womens' size 3X for shirts).",87349,4
87349,"But for the price, it's fun.",87349,4
87349,It did arrived much earlier than expected.,87349,4
87349,"Since it comes from China, that was a nice suprise.",87349,4
87350,but little thin for cold,87350,4
87351,"If you're new to having a purse, this is a great bag to start with.",87351,4
87351,Its not huge but it's big enough to fit the essentials in.,87351,4
87351,"The main opening is a little small, and the zippers came in the middle and you have to figure out which way they open and shut with all of them.",87351,4
87351,But overall I really like it.,87351,4
87351,"There's 2 open pockets and a zipper pocket inside they don't show on the description photos, so that was a nice surprise.",87351,4
87351,The smell everyone talks about really isn't that bad.,87351,4
87351,After an hour its pretty much gone.,87351,4
87351,Fabreeze will fix it if it still lingers.,87351,4
87351,"Also in the picture it looks like soft fabric, but its not.",87351,4
87351,Its nylon so don't put it in high heat,87351,4
87352,"This isn't my typical style, but I really like this top!",87352,4
87352,The fit was as expected.,87352,4
87352,"I ordered a Large, and I'm 5'8-1/2"", 155 pounds, a size 10 in jeans, and a B-cup.",87352,4
87352,The large fit well.,87352,4
87352,The only problem was that a seam right at the waist was left open for about an inch on one side.,87352,4
87352,"I stitched it closed myself, but that's the reason why I didn't give this top four stars.",87352,4
87353,"I am a fan of the X-Wing pilots of the Star Wars universe, so when I saw Poe Dameron had a shirt, I knew I wanted it.",87353,4
87353,I bought this shirt in a small and it fits perfectly.,87353,4
87353,"I will say that the print on the front makes the shirt feel a little stiff and also what is pictured here is sharper than the image on the actual T-shirt (for example, Oscar Isaac's face looks very visible in the picture but on my shirt it is much more faded and almost makes the entire lower part of the image look like the quality of an oil painting for lack of a better description).",87353,4
87353,However it is still a fine shirt and comfy to wear.,87353,4
87354,I had a baby nearly 2 months ago and have lost nearly all my baby weight but I am still left with a pooch so I live high waisted leggings.,87354,4
87354,"I am 5'5"" and 145 pounds., which is 10 pounds more than my prior to be baby weight.",87354,4
87354,"I am a ""triangle"" shaped body so I usually have to order leggings in small.",87354,4
87354,"I ordered medium just in case and it was a bit too small, but that's just my body.",87354,4
87354,"Other than that, I love the quality and the high waisted.",87354,4
87354,These leggings  are thicker than my other cotton blend or spandex.,87354,4
87355,I love the dress and fit!,87355,4
87355,"I'm a little broad in the chest, so it is a little snug in the armpit area, but other than that I love the dress and received many compliments on my first wear!",87355,4
87356,"I'm 6'1"" 195 pounds or so.",87356,4
87356,"31"" around the waist and maybe 39"" across the chest.",87356,4
87356,I got a medium and it fit just about as expected.,87356,4
87356,"I can wear it over a dress shirt and its snug, but not killing me.",87356,4
87356,"I would NOT be able to get away with a smaller size, but maybe a larger one.",87356,4
87356,If you are on the slim side you'll want a medium.,87356,4
87356,If you are wider across the chest than me you will want a large.,87356,4
87357,"It's a little long for my taste, but it's still very pretty and I like using it.",87357,4
87357,The curved bar fits very comfortably.,87357,4
87357,"It sometimes comes unclicked when I'm washing my face, but all in all it pretty secure for day to day use.",87357,4
87358,Not as warm as I thought it would be.,87358,4
87359,"Very nice, I bought for my Halloween costume this year and I plan to use it from time to time when dressing up for a night out.",87359,4
87360,"The boots are very cute, and they fit my great granddaughter perfectly.",87360,4
87360,"I like the sole on the boots, but I'm not sure about the support.",87360,4
87360,"I bought them for both walking on icy, snowy patches, and also for their warmth and their look.",87360,4
87360,They are cute and she seems to be warm and comfortable in them..,87360,4
87360,They are what I wanted them to be.,87360,4
87360,"However, the chemical smell in them when they arrive is horrible.",87360,4
87360,"I had to wash them several times before I would let her wear them, and to this day, there is still a slight chemical odor.",87360,4
87360,I would not purchase them again for this specific reason.,87360,4
87360,It makes me very uncomfortable.,87360,4
87360,These are not everyday boots for her.,87360,4
87361,its a bit bigger than expected but it is not so big I want to return it.,87361,4
87362,So far they are working well and do not slip off.,87362,4
87362,There are several strips of rubber on the inside of the heel that keep them from slipping off.,87362,4
87362,They are a bit thin so I would not recommend walking around in them on carpeted flooring.,87362,4
87362,Only good for use inside of shoes.,87362,4
87363,Very nice pocket watch for the price.,87363,4
87363,I bought it for a costume and was pleasantly surprised that it keeps time accurately.,87363,4
87365,Awesome colors and great material.,87365,4
87365,Runs a little small for me but I'm a size 13 shoe so it may just be me.,87365,4
87366,The shirt is slightly smaller than I anticipated and the way it's printed feels kinda cheap.,87366,4
87366,Anytime I wear it everyone (other guys) says how awesome it is..most girls pay no attention to it haha or its so awesome they don't know what to say.,87366,4
87366,"I'm giving it 4 stars because it's a awesome shirt...I wasn't expecting crazy mind blowing quality, it's just a funny ass shirt.",87366,4
87367,A little thinner and quite a bit smaller than I expected.,87367,4
87367,I wear a size 2-4 US and this is almost too tight in my tummy pudge...,87367,4
87367,"I have recently gained some weight I hope to lose, otherwise I would return it.",87367,4
87367,Fits fine through shoulders and bust.,87367,4
87367,"I was surprised it was so snug because I purposely ordered a medium to order ""up"" -- I have another Allegra K dress that is similar (the one that comes in blue or purple stripes), and the small is still loose on me (even with my recent extra pounds).",87367,4
87367,"Definitely order up for this one, but it is a cute dress!",87367,4
87368,"Very narrow looks more like newborn size the 0-3 month, much like gerber plain white onesies",87368,4
87369,Nice shirt but kids sizes run one size too big.,87369,4
87370,Very happy with this neck tube.,87370,4
87370,My 4 year old used it during skiing.,87370,4
87370,Note that it is very high and can be used up around the head as a hat.,87370,4
87370,The solid side is fleece.,87370,4
87370,The striped side is smooth.,87370,4
87370,"It isn't super thick, but is great for active outdoor use.",87370,4
87371,The ring is dumb but i wear the bracelet every mo fo day dogg.,87371,4
87372,Nice dress the only thing was that I fix it a litter bite but nothing big,87372,4
87373,Perfect present for a Dr. Who fan - a bit big as a pendant but works as a keychain ornament.,87373,4
87374,Did not fit me.,87374,4
87374,Giving it to a friend,87374,4
87375,This is a real cute dress that can easily be thrown over in a hurry and still look beautiful!,87375,4
87375,The order came promptly and the product is new.,87375,4
87375,I would recommend this dress for anyone who is more on the 'younger side' of life...as it is quite short.,87375,4
87375,"Unless, of course, you are a PERFECT size and can afford to show off your thighs!",87375,4
87376,"Love the look, style, color, but the underside gap is so large, it's hard keeping it on or even in place (petite woman).",87376,4
87377,"Nice dress, it fits well and didn't require any adjustments It was night for a teenager for a formal event, and she loved it.",87377,4
87377,"It comes a bit wrinkled because of the packaging, but that's not a deal breaker.",87377,4
87378,have not been able to wear shoes after a week.,87378,4
87380,i'm usually a medium but read the reviews and decided to get a large.,87380,4
87380,it was confusing to put on at first because of the holes but fit perfect.,87380,4
87380,it was nice that it was opened as my boyfriend enjoyed it very much.,87380,4
87380,only problem is that it's not really machine washable and dryer compatible since little stretchy strings came out but all in all I still enjoyed it,87380,4
87381,I like the backpack but I was expecting it to be bigger than it is.,87381,4
87381,Really doesn't work that great for an overnight bag because of the small size.,87381,4
87381,The pictures make it look bigger than it is when I received it.,87381,4
87382,I'm not a big fan of purses but I have two small children that I have to lug things around for and was looking for a large purse big enough to do so.,87382,4
87382,I came across this one and let me tell you I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!,87382,4
87382,"It's prefect size, not too big but not small and I can't express how beautiful it is, I got the red version and the red is so vibrant!",87382,4
87382,"CONS: the only issue I have with it is the material ""flaps"" on the inside for the zipper are a bit stiff and it makes it hard to get into the pockets.",87382,4
87382,I'm hoping they will get more flimsy over time!,87382,4
87382,This is my reason for 4 stars instead of 5.,87382,4
87383,"I have found the i play swim diapers to run a bit small for my child, but we still love them.",87383,4
87383,We have purchased these in all sizes starting at 3 months for our babies.,87383,4
87383,I would highly recommend these.,87383,4
87383,They are the perfect solution for a reusable swim diaper for a child.,87383,4
87383,I love i play products and this one was up to par as I've found all their products to be.,87383,4
87384,Very nice material and a good fit.,87384,4
87384,I am small busted so no problem but a large busted person may have an issue.,87384,4
87385,functions as expected; took long to arrive.,87385,4
87385,waiting to see how long it lasts with actual use,87385,4
87386,Cute for my 14 year old,87386,4
87387,I DID ORDER A LARGER SIZE SO IT DOES FIT ...ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER,87387,4
87388,It will work .,87388,4
87389,love the style of the suit.,87389,4
87389,looks great and hides everything that a new mom might want to hide.,87389,4
87389,"it does run small which they tell you but for the price, totally worth buying 2 if you need different sizes for the top and bottom.",87389,4
87389,"I got the xl, I'm a size 8-10 on the bottom but ordered an xxl to fit my chest as I am a 36DD.",87389,4
87389,can't wait for the beach.,87389,4
87390,I wish it was a little bit longer but I will wear it anyway.,87390,4
87390,It is soft to the touch and I look forward to colder weather so that I can wear it.,87390,4
87391,Its a little tiny for the price.,87391,4
87391,It was the size of a dime.,87391,4
87391,But it works great.,87391,4
87391,My husband still liked it!,87391,4
87392,"light weight but still sturdy, helpful for holding an additional bag attached to larger luggage, stayed put;  helpful to wrap up a coat we needed to carry along; anything that makes traveling even a little easier is worth it for me, not pricey so if they don't hold up or need to be replaced no real harm done but so far so good; i'll continue to use these",87392,4
87393,"For the price, these necklaces are very nice.",87393,4
87393,I purchased them for gifts.,87393,4
87393,The purple looks more pink though.,87393,4
87395,WARNING ****The Red is NOT Red.,87395,4
87395,They are HOT PINK otherwise adorable!,87395,4
87398,a little small wish it was a bit bigger,87398,4
87399,This a super cute inexpensive Yellow Lucite teardrop bib statement necklace and earring set.,87399,4
87399,"This really is a set, and it really is that cheap.",87399,4
87399,"This is not your best quality costume jewelry, but for a few dollars, I didn't expect it to be.",87399,4
87399,The necklace is a great color yellow and is very bright.,87399,4
87399,The necklace has not fallen apart and I have worn it several times not to mention that my 2 year old daughter  likes to wear the necklace as well.,87399,4
87399,"I have worn just the necklace, just the earrings and I also have worn the entire set.",87399,4
87399,I like the length of the Necklace is not too short and it is not too long.,87399,4
87399,This necklace will make a great addition to any outfit that you choose.,87399,4
87400,Over all great product but it's a little smaller then I thought they'd be.,87400,4
87400,Luckily I buy my kids shoes 1/2 a size big for room to grow so these will still work.,87400,4
87400,But only for this season.,87400,4
87401,Blousie in the front but not in the back.,87401,4
87401,Kinda weird but still nice,87401,4
87402,These shoes fit great & are very comfortable!,87402,4
87403,"Flexes when goes on and off, so adjusts to finger easily.",87403,4
87403,"Worry somewhat about metal fatigue if the ring flexes too much, but fine for now.",87403,4
87406,This dress is so comfortable and fit me perfectly.,87406,4
87406,I did have to iron out a bunch of really bad creases and it didn't come with care instructions but other than that it's great!,87406,4
87407,"The headpiece still works for an adult, but tail will not fit.",87407,4
87408,It does run a lil small.,87408,4
87408,I'm a 38 B and I ordered a Large and it fit fine just a little small on the top,87408,4
87409,Sizing of top was too small and bottoms were a tad bit too big.,87409,4
87409,Customer service was a plus though.,87409,4
87411,"This sports bra is cute and gives fair support, however the criss-cross in the back goes right over your shoulder blades which I find annoying when I'm exercising.",87411,4
87411,Other than that its great for cardio!,87411,4
87412,They are great and come with a cute little pouch.,87412,4
87412,They are a bit too flexible and often need to be bent back in to shape.,87412,4
87412,Hopefully they do not suffer from too much wear and tear due to this issue.,87412,4
87413,"It's soft and comfortable, beautiful dark purple.",87413,4
87413,I will be getting a lot of use out of it.,87413,4
87415,great necklace....thought it was more emerald than it is.,87415,4
87415,but it still works.. lots of compliments,87415,4
87416,"This is a very lightweight, adorable dress.",87416,4
87416,I plan on wearing this dress in the carribean for the night life.,87416,4
87416,"I am 5'6"" and weigh 140 pounds and the dress touches my knees.",87416,4
87416,In the photo it shows a shorter dress (hitting above the thighs).,87416,4
87416,The dress ties in the back and you may need someone to tie it for you.,87416,4
87416,I tied mine and it just did not look right in the back.,87416,4
87416,"Even when the dress is tied as tight as it will go around the neck, It was only 3 inches above my knees.",87416,4
87416,Very different from the photo.,87416,4
87416,"If you are a seamstress, you could hem it higher for yourself.",87416,4
87416,"If you take it to a seamstress, it would cost $10 to have it hemmed.",87416,4
87416,You cannot wear a bra with this dress without the bra showing.,87416,4
87416,"If you are in your 20's and have never had children, you could wear the 'stick on' bra.",87416,4
87416,"But, if you need to wear a bra, this is not the dress for you.",87416,4
87417,"These earrings are very pretty, but they are rather difficult to put on.",87417,4
87417,"Each one is three pieces:  front, back, and post back holder.",87417,4
87418,"I love this romper, I ordered my right size and it fit perfect, I am short so I didn't think I'd have any problems.",87418,4
87418,"It fits really short though, I even returned it and went up a size thinking the length would be a little longer but even with a larger size my butt cheeks were still peeking out, in which I am not a fan over, but overall the fabric was nice and it was just like the picture.",87418,4
87419,I am a barefoot runner and they are used when frost is on the ground.,87419,4
87419,I should have bought the next largest size,87419,4
87420,"Based on reviews, I bought the jacket a size up ( I am usually a medium and got a large) and it is huge.",87420,4
87420,"I'm 5'10"", so I'm use to buying a size larger for length and height, but this jacket is true to size.",87420,4
87420,"Besides the jacket being massive, it is nice quality for the price.",87420,4
87421,colors were great but a little on the big side and the material was sheer so I have to wear something under it,87421,4
87422,The quality of the bag for the price was awesome.,87422,4
87422,"However, I'm still trying to get rid of the toxic smell that came with it.",87422,4
87422,I'm not sure if it is worth it.,87422,4
87422,"But, the customer service was excellent.",87422,4
87422,I was given a large discount because of the smell.,87422,4
87423,"This hat is adorable and is a dark purple not the more pink color displayed, this hat is also about half as full as pictured.",87423,4
87424,"Runs very small - size up unless your child runs small, too!",87424,4
87425,Nice light weight outer shell.,87425,4

87427,Cheaply made but very very cute.,87427,4
87427,Get a ton of compliments each time I wear it.,87427,4
87428,I'll be getting a smaller one.,87428,4
87429,Good top design for my bust size.,87429,4
87430,"5'10"", 150 pounds, a little snug in ""that"" area",87430,4
87431,"Like everything except the color, more orange than I expected.",87431,4
87432,"Just as pictured, nice quality.",87432,4
87432,I was extremely disappointed it was delivered broke on the necklace part.,87432,4
87432,"Hopefully they can replace soon, I can't wait to wear it!",87432,4
87435,"They are little bit more sheer than expected, but the color is perfect!",87435,4
87435,Wore these for 80's night.,87435,4
87436,"The material i good, not cheap.",87436,4
87436,"However, the arms part of the shirt is tight.",87436,4
87437,A little hard to take off but I love it I wear it almost everyday,87437,4
87438,I am very pleasantly surprised by these shirts!,87438,4
87438,I ordered 3/4 colors and they are nearly perfect.,87438,4
87438,My only *tiny* complaint is that the white one is decently sheer.,87438,4
87438,"Nude undergarments are all that's needed, but it is still worth mentioning.",87438,4
87438,This is an extremely lightweight she comfortable fabric.,87438,4
87438,These also arrived 2 weeks earlier than the anticipated delivery range.,87438,4
87438,I am very pleased with this purchase!,87438,4
87440,very nice but very transparent didn't expected to be,87440,4
87441,got this for my sister as a gift for a beach party she loved it and it fits her curves perfectly.,87441,4
87442,"These fit as expected, the quality is good and my son loves them.",87442,4
87443,wife like it that's all that matters,87443,4
87444,"A gift, they seemed pleased.",87444,4
87446,"Bought these for my daughter,  who has long,  very narrow feet, (size 13 1/2 AA).",87446,4
87446,"It's next to impossible to find Women's shoes or slippers in her size, so unisex is most times her only option.",87446,4
87446,"Though these are wider than she needs,  she said they're very comfortable and warm... and they're not too masculine looking as some unisex products are... couldn't beat the price either!",87446,4
87448,Fit is small so order up but other then that I love the print and comfort!,87448,4
87448,I ordered this bathing suit in another color too!...I was a little disappointed in the way it was sewn though so be careful when taking off the tag..mine started to unravel a little but for the price it's a great deal!,87448,4
87449,"The shirt material isn't like normal shirts, it has more of a cheap silk kind of feel, and is an ok color.",87449,4
87449,"I am 5'6 and weight 105 pounds, so I'm fairly tiny.",87449,4
87449,"I normally wear an adults medium in US size, so I got the large.",87449,4
87449,"The fit was pretty decent, but since I'm so skinny it's not as form fitting as I wanted.",87449,4
87449,"Honestly though, I feel like the proportions are kinda off.",87449,4
87449,The shoulders are really wide and the sleeves are really long.,87449,4
87449,"I feel as though the torso fits ok, and when I put it on it looks pretty good.",87449,4
87449,"I would recommend this shirt, and if you are skinny like me and want a more slim fit shirt go for the medium instead.",87449,4
87450,It's nicely fitting though shorter than I expected it is a really nice color too and comfortable.,87450,4
87451,My wife likes these also.,87451,4
87452,Beautiful piece of jewelry.,87452,4
87452,Only gave it 4 because the chain has no clasp.,87452,4
87452,A men's necklace should have a clasp.,87452,4
87452,Won't fit over my son's head.,87452,4
87453,"too small, i wear a size ten, and I could not zip this up, on top, probably closer to a 6. the dress is very pretty, except the beading at waist line is on triangular taps, so it looks a little costume-y.. but still pretty.",87453,4
87454,Just as described and arrived right on time,87454,4
87455,I bought this swimsuit because it looks so great in the picture.,87455,4
87455,I was scrolling down the page and saw it and fell in love with it.,87455,4
87455,I had looked at the previous reviews and saw where most of them said the bottoms were too large but the top fit correctly.,87455,4
87455,"Well, I received the swimsuit in a very timely manner, it was sealed up so I would definitely say it was well packaged.",87455,4
87455,I ordered the teal and black one and the color was true to the picture shown.,87455,4
87455,"I have a fuller seat area than a lot of women my size, but by no means am overweight, I am a size 10/12 but curvy.",87455,4
87455,The bottoms fit well but I guess it is the way I am built.,87455,4
87455,"Now, to the top,  It has a hook closure in the back that can be adjusted which was good in my opinion.",87455,4
87455,"In the past, the swimsuit tops I have purchased had the padded inserts which could be removed.",87455,4
87455,This one has the padded part sewn in so removing the padding is not an option.,87455,4
87455,The padding is kind of thick so took a little getting used to.,87455,4
87455,I wear a large but ordered xl since I knew Asian clothing runs small.,87455,4
87455,Just keep in mind that the bottoms run big and use the sizing chart provided in order to save you the hassle of a return.,87455,4
87455,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,87455,4
87455,"I assure you, my reviews are honest and not swayed by the purchasing price.",87455,4
87456,"It's adorable and super comfy, but the neck part doesn't rest on your neck.",87456,4
87456,"It kind of sits up, it's weird.",87456,4
87456,But I love the look of the shirt!,87456,4
87456,The small even fits over my big 8 month belly!,87456,4
87457,I love how soft they are on the inside.,87457,4
87458,4 stars b/c 3 day delayed delivery,87458,4
87460,"First, I got the maroon co!",87460,4
87460,or and I LOVE that faded maroon!,87460,4
87460,"I found the fit to be rather small, I have a regular size head so ordered the large, thinking it might be a bit roomier for summer, but it fit rather snug.",87460,4
87460,"But then, I look at the hat and realize it isn't a sun hat with a nice wide brim, it is a hat to cover your head in the sun.",87460,4
87460,"I will still plop it on when I go outside this spring, summer as it is cute, but I guess I would like it a bit roomier than what it ended up being.",87460,4
87460,"Seems to be decently made, haven't washed it yet.",87460,4
87460,"I don't regret buying it, as I can and will use it.",87460,4
87460,To me this is cuter than a baseball cap.,87460,4
87461,So I was soooo pleased!,87461,4
87461,But I'm not huge and it's very snug!,87461,4
87461,"Like VERY snug lol I'm also busty so if you have boobs, it will squish them XD I also bought the jacket and skirt too so all together very pleased it's just a tight fit but love it anyway!!",87461,4
87462,Love this skirt very nice quality and doesn't wrinkle easily but I bought a small it was pretty big and long.,87462,4
87462,I have a very petite body but it fits more like a medium.,87462,4
87462,"I gave it to my my friend who is 5'10"", fits her perfectly and she loves it.",87462,4
87463,The white portion wasn't as white as I hoping,87463,4
87465,"The small fits snugly around the torso perfectly (155 lbs, 5' 7"").",87465,4
87465,"being on the shorter side, I found the length to be a bit longer than anticipated (just below the pants waist).",87465,4
87465,I wear this around the office on the cooler days.,87465,4
87466,Finally a shirt that fits perfect,87466,4
87467,The suit was really nice in colors and the pattern was what I expected like the picture.,87467,4
87467,"Only complaint I have is I got a size bigger thinking it would come a little small, but I wish I had gotten my actual size instead cause it seems it sizes are correct and if you wear a large get a large.",87467,4
87467,Plus it don't have pads but I just took the pads from an old suit n used them.,87467,4
87468,"Love the bracelets, the pendant hangs lower than I expected but I did not measure before I ordered.",87468,4
87468,I may convert it to another bracelet.,87468,4
87469,Snug in the arms,87469,4
87471,The shirt was perfect.,87471,4
87472,"A little shorter than anticipated, but has the gauzy look I wanted",87472,4
87473,Reall great for summer,87473,4
87474,Cute shirt got a small.,87474,4
87474,Ties around in the back like this.,87474,4
87474,Wish I had a picture of the front because it also looks cute,87474,4
87475,I had previously purchased a pair of these pants in label size 32 US size 31 and really like them but found them a little large so for this purchase ordered label size 31/ US size 30.,87475,4
87475,Much better fit and get lots of good feedback.,87475,4
87476,"Very snug fit, but that's what makes it max control.",87476,4
87476,Not comfortable for all day wear.,87476,4
87477,"I'm a US 8 and so ordered a size up after reading the reviews saying size fits small I ordered a large, it was a little big however it looked good and was great for the occasion, next time I will order a medium though.",87477,4
87477,very good price and looks much more expensive in real life.,87477,4
87478,"As you can see, is too short, so it can be called ""too sexy"" also.",87478,4
87478,"But everything else is ok, it fit very nice.",87478,4
87478,"I usually wear an M, but I ordered an L and it fits very well.",87478,4
87479,"It's big, it's solid, and it's even more colorful than the picture.",87479,4
87479,"It's not exactly what I was looking for, but as a bright, cheerful, vacation-at-the-beach kind of bag?",87479,4
87479,"My only real complaint is that it looks like it has a woven grass texture from the picture, and it doesn't.",87479,4
87479,"And that's all my fault, I should have read the description more closely.",87479,4
87481,They showed up quickly and fit my 9 year old quite well.,87481,4
87482,Love the color .,87482,4
87482,These pants are well made and not see threw .,87482,4
87482,I would definitely  recommend  these workout pants.,87482,4
87484,"Ok, but wouldn't buy again.",87484,4
87484,Looks like a pajama top,87484,4
87485,"Waist trainer is, as described.",87485,4
87485,The hooks are sturdy and it makes you sweat a bit.,87485,4
87485,I do get some rolling but I have an odd shape.,87485,4
87485,Don't be afraid of its tight it's supposed to be tight.,87485,4
87485,Its worth the price.,87485,4
87486,"This skirt is very well made, but it's a little small.",87486,4
87486,I can fit into it fine but I'm a little scared it'll rip if I sit down wrong!,87486,4
87486,"The belt makes it even tighter so I won't be wearing that, but that's okay because I bought this for my Nana Osaki cosplay and the belt doesn't go with it.",87486,4
87487,Accidentally dropped my bar that had the balls of  this product on it and the ball completely shattered.,87487,4
87487,It was only a four foot drop.,87487,4
87488,I bought 4 for myself and 3 other family members.,87488,4
87488,The only thing I would change is the length of the chain.,87488,4
87488,It's very long and will either have to have it shortened or get a shorter chain,87488,4
87489,Khaki color is too yellow.,87489,4
87490,Too big for our 7 week old baby.,87490,4
87490,Looks like it'll do the job though.,87490,4
87491,"super cute, I get lots of compliments but the mater snags very easily.",87491,4
87492,"They fit well, I like them.",87492,4
87493,"(**Daughter's Review**)
I've needed a choker set for so long and this was exactly what I was looking for!",87493,4
87493,I got all three pieces and the shipping was super quick.,87493,4
87493,"The only problem I have with this is that the bracelet and the ring leave marks on my hands and fingers (which I am very known for having thin fingers and wrists, so it was a bit surprising) so I wouldn't wear them for too long; just a day at school/work is fine.",87493,4
87493,"Other than that, this product is super cute and worth the purchase!",87493,4
87494,The RuMe tote is a nice surprise.,87494,4
87494,"It comes in a little pouch, that turns into the out side pocket.",87494,4
87494,It's roomy but not so big you can't use it as a tote or purse.,87494,4
87494,"It's not heavy, even loaded up with all my things I would put in a purse and more.",87494,4
87494,"It's cute, and comfortable to carry.",87494,4
87494,"With so many designs to choose from, your bound to see one you like.",87494,4
87494,Give this product a chance.,87494,4
87494,I gave it four star's only because I wish it had some structure.,87494,4
87494,Maybe piping just so it would keep it's shape.,87494,4
87495,"These FINALLY have relieved my plantar fasciitis and heel pain better than anything else - other orthotics, doctor visits, injections, taping, boots, etc.",87495,4
87495,"It says they're for ""mild pronation"" - I have a fairly high arch and normally wear neutral running shoes, but I found even with liners out most ""neutral"" orthotics were pushing my foot too far to the outside.",87495,4
87495,These are working well for me.,87495,4
87495,"Padding is excellent, arch support is adequate, and the heel cup keeps the heel from getting further irritated by moving around..",87495,4
87496,These are a great alternative if the Adidas tiro or condivo pants are too long.,87496,4
87496,"these pants feel more like cotton than polyester, meaning they will be hot to wear and become pilly easily",87496,4
87497,"The fit was okay, but somewhat short for me in the torso and legs.",87497,4
87497,Since I'm wearing boots with my costume you don't notice the high water length.,87497,4
87497,It's a little short in the torso area but if I went bigger it would be baggy everywhere else.,87497,4
87497,"I am 5'9 and 135lbs, and I ordered a Medium.",87497,4
87497,"The accessories are cheaply made so if you are using this costume for cosplay vs Halloween, I'd go with different holster and gloves.",87497,4
87497,"Otherwise, I really like it.",87497,4
87497,"First photo is with the holster that comes with it, the second is the utility belt and thigh holsters I actually use.",87497,4
87498,It doesn't hang off the shoulders for.,87498,4
87499,Came a day early too.,87499,4
87499,It was a little too big for the top portion of my body but it's good enough,87499,4
87500,I really like Victorias Secret underwear.,87500,4
87500,"While not as nice, this product is comparable to the pair I like with the thick lace band.",87500,4
87500,I am a size 8 in women's and these just fit me.,87500,4
87500,Probably wouldn't want them any smaller.,87500,4
87501,Bought this for my 18 year old son.,87501,4
87501,"Great material, nice & thin.",87501,4
87502,Cool belt.. but somewhat cheap made.,87502,4
87503,The leather is thinner than I was expecting,87503,4
87504,I started using at about 3 weeks postpartum.,87504,4
87504,"I wanted to see what size I would need since I knew I would shrink in size pretty quickly, and that was fortunate because I probably would have needed to buy two different sizes of the Belly Bandits.",87504,4
87504,"I do have a bit of trouble sitting in it, so I only wear at night when I sleep.",87504,4
87504,I've seen my tummy shrink a little bit so far!,87504,4
87504,"Will see how this works out but so far, I'm happy with it.",87504,4
87505,Love the design and color,87505,4
87506,Fits snug run small great quality,87506,4
87507,I thought it was a gold finish like it said but it's more of a rose finish.,87507,4
87509,Slightly see thru but very pretty,87509,4
87510,It was a gift for a coworker to wear at a Christmas Party and she liked it.,87510,4
87511,The material and cut was as described however the medium as way too big.,87511,4
87511,I will be returning it.,87511,4
87512,"Great hat, if you can style it.",87512,4
87513,I am thinking I would have liked this shirt if I'd gone a size up from what was recommended.,87513,4
87513,"I want to love it, the concept is cool but the fit is kinda wonky and the bottoms of the sleeves are downright weird.",87513,4
87513,"Like, there's a gathered cuff weird..

EDIT to add:

Ok, I've actually worn the shirt out now and I like it a little better than my first impression.",87513,4
87513,"I still don't like the cuff on the sleeve, but I just pulled it up to my elbow and it worked ok. Not a bad shirt.",87513,4
87515,Our baby is now almost 4 months old.,87515,4
87515,This hat provides good coverage from the sun.,87515,4
87515,"It is lightweight, washes easily, and does not crinkle.",87515,4
87515,I like that the hat can easily be tightened around the head with the adjustable string.,87515,4
87515,"It's not the prettiest hat, it's not made of a natural material (which I typically prefer), and it's made in China (I usually try to purchase products for our children from other countries of origin).",87515,4
87515,"That being said, I knew all these things before purchasing the hat - the description on Amazon was accurate.",87515,4
87515,I therefore give the sunhat a rating of 4 stars.,87515,4
87516,I like how small this goes down for storage.,87516,4
87516,This takes up minimal room.,87516,4
87516,it doesn't take up much room in the pack.,87516,4
87516,I'm impressed with the silicone  keeps its shape and can stay standing when it is full of water.,87516,4
87516,The silicone is soft but sturdy.,87516,4
87517,"Bottoms fit well but the top suffocated my titties, lol.",87517,4
87519,"Great t-shirt, onlye the sleves does not fit as expected but in general I liked it.",87519,4
87520,"It came yesterday in this cute little package, it's gorgeous!",87520,4
87520,Not sure if it turns like others have said yet because I only received it yesterday.,87520,4
87521,Giving 4 stars for 2 reasons 1 the clasp the locks in place is super loose.,87521,4
87521,Kind of a pain to put in.,87521,4
87521,2 the stone fell out and the ring started to turn green only had this clicker for a few months and I don't wear it all the time just on the weekends.,87521,4
87521,Overall for the price it was a good purchase.,87521,4
87522,I ordered this for a Bachelorette weekend.,87522,4
87522,I will say I was super nervous to order it after reading the reviews.,87522,4
87522,"I got it in pink, and when I tried it on I was a little confused as to how to put it on because it is literally a pair of shorts with two long straps attached to it, and then you wrap them around to make it look like the picture.",87522,4
87522,"I got a M because I was worried it would be too big, but I definitely could have gotten a large.",87522,4
87522,"It was tight in the coochie area, but still wearable.",87522,4
87522,"As for people saying it is see-through... the straps for the boobs are very sheer, but I was able to wear them out during our night on the town bra-less without being able to see my nips.",87522,4
87522,"I probably won't wear it again, but for the price, its an awesome little romper, and it definitely got the job done.",87522,4
87522,(I am the one with the long dark hair in the picture),87522,4
87523,Loved it.. Order it for my mom it looked great one her.,87523,4
87524,"Good quality, but the posts are a little sharp, prickly in the back.",87524,4
87524,Maybe a little long.,87524,4
87524,"But otherwise, really pretty and great quality.",87524,4
87525,The images are really good on the socks.,87525,4
87526,I'm size 5 in pants I'm 5'2 I'm 136 pounds I got size Medium in the woman's but lifter and its fits perfect it's not to tight or too loose is a perfect fit.,87526,4
87526,The only thing I did not like was how you can slightly see the lining of the shorts but the lines around the booty are not noticeable at all which I like.,87526,4
87526,I purchased this to work out at the gym but I have also wore it out and I have no problem with it.,87526,4
87526,"I did notice a huge difference my booty looks more lifted and firm and bigger of course, this is an item I would definitely recommend.",87526,4
87526,For the price is totally worth it!!!,87526,4
87527,Soft comfy and attractive.,87527,4
87529,"Its okay, it does make you sweat when you are actively moving.",87529,4
87530,It looks exactly as pictured and the fabric quality is high.,87530,4
87530,The seller is a great communicator.,87530,4
87530,You'll need to order 1 size larger than you wear in US sizing.,87530,4
87530,The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the silk screening is flawed with a couple of streaks.,87530,4
87531,"Nice lightweight, breathable, moisture-wicking underwear.",87531,4
87531,Regular rise to them rather than the trendy low rise.,87531,4
87531,"I've heard a few seams rip already, so be careful with them.",87531,4
87531,I air dry them (as I do most of the newer moisture-wicking type material garments I have).,87531,4
87532,"I am giving four stars as the product came as described and came in a nice box, safely packaged.",87532,4
87532,But these are not to my taste (no fault of the seller).,87532,4
87532,"These are way larger than I anticipated, but that is probably my fault for not paying attention to the measurements.",87532,4
87532,They are very heavy earrings and I will hang on to them to give as a gift to someone who may enjoy them more than me.,87532,4
87532,"If they were large, but not so heavy, I would enjoy them more.",87532,4
87533,"Ordered blue, wasn't as bright as the image.",87533,4
87533,Read reviews so I expected that.,87533,4
87533,Fit is good -- top is a little short.,87533,4
87533,"Overall, totally worth the money.",87533,4
87533,"If you're willing to wear a two piece like this, you expect to show some skin so small top isn't a deal breaker.",87533,4
87533,Ended up ordering a second outfit for my sister who absolutely loved it too.,87533,4
87534,"Alittle big, so baby must grow into them but adorable.",87534,4
87535,"This does run big, so keep in mind when you order.",87535,4
87535,"It is a little large on my year old baby, the looser fit is fine and will be great for the beach.",87535,4
87536,"They haven't had their first washing, but so far they fit like they should.",87536,4
87536,Everything stays where it belongs I'm hoping this is true after multiple washing & then I'll buy more.,87536,4
87537,"my wife loves it , perfect fit",87537,4
87538,It's light and comfortable..,87538,4
87538,Arrived earlier than expected..,87538,4
87538,Words are just spaced out..,87538,4
87539,Great quality for the price .,87539,4
87539,I ordered the largest size for my son who wears a men's 7 and they are slightly smaller than I expected compared to his other footwear in the same size.,87539,4
87540,It's made of good heavy fabric.,87540,4
87540,"For my son, the fit was more like an extra large.",87540,4
87541,I love the hat it just needed to be a Lil bigger,87541,4
87542,I like the look of it and it has a little more weight on it than I expected it to.,87542,4
87542,"It is nice and comfortable and perfect for wearing as is or if you want to later add charms to it, which I plan on doing!",87542,4
87543,Brand must run small though.,87543,4
87543,"My son wears a size 3, so we bought these in a 3.5 and they barely fit him.",87543,4
87544,I'm 5'4' the tale was a little long and the stings annoyed me- but for the price and functionality- it was great!!,87544,4
87545,Bought 2 of them and wear them a lot.,87545,4
87546,"I love the size of this bag, and the straps.",87546,4
87546,I can fit a large hardcover book and a bottle of water along with all my essentials.,87546,4
87546,Only negative is the mild sulfur like smell (I guess from the dye?),87546,4
87546,It goes away eventually.,87546,4
87548,These are very pretty....well made and  beautiful on.,87548,4
87549,"Pros:
Fit is comfortable and color is true to pictures.",87549,4
87549,Good for workout or for relaxing around the house.,87549,4
87549,"Cons:
Straps get tangled easily and front of straps can rub on arm pits when wearing all day.",87549,4
87549,"All in all, nice shirt.",87549,4
87549,I have this is multiple clors,87549,4
87550,really long and the ides do a weird puff out thing but my mom is going to fix that and It was worth the money,87550,4
87552,"Nice sturdy belt, but the buckle is a bit large.",87552,4
87554,Is a little thinner than i wanted but is pretty good.,87554,4
87556,I ordered a Men's Medium because I like my tees a bit large; this one obviously runs smaller like a size junior.,87556,4
87556,It fits normal in the shoulders but is smaller through the mid-section.,87556,4
87556,"Would fit someone with a tall, thin build quite well because it is also about one or two inches longer than an average tee shirt.",87556,4
87556,I am getting a lot of compliments on the green color that I chose.,87556,4
87557,Worked well for my 10 year for Halloween,87557,4
87558,top runs a little small but super cute,87558,4
87559,"Just one complain, a little extra weight on the tip would be nice.",87559,4
87560,It is bigger then it looks.,87560,4
87560,But it has come in handy.,87560,4
87562,Not a one size fits all like advertised.,87562,4
87562,Not a lot of stretch like with other products like this.,87562,4
87562,Anyone UNDER NOT AT US size 8 should be fine.,87562,4
87563,"Great for on top of the bed, light enough for my grandson to pull off the bed and bring it to the tv room to snuggle with!",87563,4
87564,Fits me like a glove.,87564,4
87564,"I'm asian 112 pounds, 5'3"" tall.",87564,4
87564,The material is great and the color is just too cute to resist.,87564,4
87564,I ordered this through Prime and I was supposed to get it after two days but arrived 5 days later.,87564,4
87566,"Love the dress, but it's too tight; should have ordered XL??",87566,4
87567,Bought as a gift...cute.,87567,4
87568,"I like these shirts but they do run small, even thought they run small when I raise my arms my stomach stays covered, hard to find a shirt like that anymore.",87568,4
87568,They are thin but when its hot I don't want a thick shirt anyways.,87568,4
87568,Cheap enough that if I ruin it on the farm it is not a big deal.,87568,4
87568,I have bought 12 shirts and I am happy with them but just a SIZE warning I where a 1x and I order a 3x in these shirts.,87568,4
87570,Necklace was setup weird  or something.,87570,4
87570,But it was cute,87570,4
87571,"Sturdy, pretty, just what I ordered.",87571,4
87571,"It's not as big as the umbrella I had used for years, and so I feel as if I'm settling, even though it's a really nice umbrella!",87571,4
87572,This dress came very quickly.,87572,4
87572,I bought it for my daughter for a party and it was very pretty.,87572,4
87572,"The fabric feels a little cheap, but you can't tell by looking at it and I have no cause for complaint because the price was extremely reasonable.",87572,4
87572,I was very happy with my purchase,87572,4
87573,Good wish it fit a little better & wasn't black,87573,4
87574,I am very impressed.,87574,4
87574,"Looks identical to the one pictured, and it is also very light weight and thin.",87574,4
87574,"I'd say that the worst thing about this is the price tag, considering it doesn't exactly come with a chain but instead a black cord.",87574,4
87574,It's definitely a unique piece of jewelry.,87574,4
87576,Getting the coverplate to stay against the ceiling is difficult.,87576,4
87577,Very comfortable for hot summer days.,87577,4
87577,"Could use a little longer bust portion, its a little small, especially for pregnant busts.",87577,4
87577,"The length of the skirt portion hit me just at the knees, maybe an inch or two above.",87577,4
87577,"(5ft 6in) Seems to wash well, though I have only washed it once.",87577,4
87577,Hopefully it will hold up with multiple washes and wears.,87577,4
87577,Worth it if you have a bust on the smaller side.,87577,4
87578,Much cheaper than an Triangl bikini but just as cute!,87578,4
87578,"The top is padded and just like a corset top, so ladies if you have one boob bigger (like I do), I would recommend using the straps (included).",87578,4
87578,"Like all the other reviews, the bottom is a size smaller than the top, so you won't be able to fit it, so I gave it to my sister who's a 32A.",87578,4
87579,The shirt fit perfectly.,87579,4
87579,It was a good quality and looked greay,87579,4
87581,This is a flattering and nice looking blouse.,87581,4
87581,"However, after I put it on, I noticed it had holes along the sleeve so I had to return it.",87581,4
87582,Looks and feels great,87582,4
87583,The ring is very beautiful no doubt but the black stone came out on the very first day I didn't even wear it,87583,4
87584,"The fit is tight across the arch, I have a hard time getting them on, my shoe repair man will extend the straps across my arch for a better fit.",87584,4
87584,I loce the shoes.,87584,4
87585,I would have given it 5 stars but the price for one single pair of socks at $16.95 is a bit too much.,87585,4
87585,"Great quality, a little too expensive for a pair of socks.",87585,4
87586,The stone and setting is beautiful.,87586,4
87587,I bought the black space dye print in X-Large size.,87587,4
87587,"I carry most of my weight around the belly
with slim hips/legs.",87587,4
87587,"I am 5'6"" and around 190 lbs, and the fit is comfortable around the
waist.",87587,4
87587,High cut like the picture shows.,87587,4
87587,"I feel the ends of the legs were cut a little big, and would prefer they cling to my lower legs
at the opening better than they do.",87587,4
87587,"My legs are slim for my weight, so this might be a benefit
for some?",87587,4
87587,I feel these are true to size.,87587,4
87587,"They are not a Junior's cut, so not overly tight.",87587,4
87589,fast shipping.my only concern was it was abit too big so the chart for me was off but nothing that couldn't be adjusted,87589,4
87590,These were nice for the beach when I'm not into showing too much.,87590,4
87590,A little big but workable.,87590,4
87591,"I'm 5'5"" 117lbs and the Medium was way too big.",87591,4
87591,"No love lost though, it was bought with the intention of modifying it.",87591,4
87591,Style is super cute and flattering,87591,4
87592,"They are really comfortable and keep me warm, but it slides down quickly if you pull them past the knee which is where I like them.",87592,4
87592,"However, I am about 5'7"" so I may have just needed a size up.",87592,4
87592,Great socks either way.,87592,4
87594,Wishing for more soon!,87594,4
87595,"I love this dress, but it fits a bit smaller than expected.",87595,4
87596,They came sooner than promised.,87596,4
87596,My niece tried them on and immediately said they felt too big.,87596,4
87596,I don't remember what size I ordered but my advice is plan on them running a little big,87596,4
87597,Go one size up.,87597,4
87598,"A little larger than expected, but isn't it usually the other way around?",87598,4
87598,I think it would look very flattering on a girl's / ladies hair pulled back on a more formal occasion.,87598,4
87598,"Since I don't attend many of those anymore, I believe I'll save it for a younger ladies gift.",87598,4
87598,It's just as pretty as pictured.,87598,4
87599,"Like the hat but one reason I bought it, aside from the blue color,  was that it stated it was made in the USA.",87599,4
87599,It's made in Taiwan.,87599,4
87599,I contacted Amazon about the misleading info but they haven't corrected the description on the product.,87599,4
87599,"So buy it for the color, or the style, but don't buy it because it was made in the USA because it wasn't.",87599,4
87600,I bought this shoes in a 4 for my son who normally wears a kid 4.,87600,4
87600,"However, it was a bit too small.",87600,4
87600,I had to go up a size.,87600,4
87600,This shoes is well made and very stylish.,87600,4
87601,I really liked it it holds a lot of stuff.,87601,4
87602,Saying on the front would be strange to westerners.,87602,4
87602,"Some sadness, much Happiness!",87602,4
87602,Not in line with our Disneyworld atmosphere but I kind of liked it.,87602,4
87603,"Time will tell, as of now I have no comments.",87603,4
87604,Fit a little smaller in the chest area than I expected but I am larger in that area so overall i would say it fit as expected.,87604,4
87604,The quality and material is nice :),87604,4
87605,"I have to wear black at work, was running out of ideas for blouses!",87605,4
87605,Dressy enough but still functional.,87605,4
87606,"The corset fit nicely, but I was able to close it all the way.",87606,4
87606,I want to have about 4 inches of space so that I can tighten it.,87606,4
87606,I would recommend going a size down or two from what they recommend on waist size if you are trying to shrink your waist slowly.,87606,4
87606,I measured for a size 3XL but am going to return it for an XL.,87606,4
87607,Fit perfect great material especially for the price,87607,4
87608,It is very well made and beautiful in person.,87608,4
87608,The only thing I would change would be the ability to make the strap even shorter while not in the backpack mode.,87608,4
87608,I have it at its shortest length and it falls almost mid thigh for me and I am of average height for a woman.,87608,4
87608,I would still purchase this product though.,87608,4
87609,Looked good and there's plenty of it!,87609,4
87610,It should say hay if you're not American kiss my ass,87610,4
87611,I don't love it but I like it for a season.,87611,4
87611,Just wish the sides were so low.,87611,4
87615,"Fun gift, nice quality, good graphics.",87615,4
87615,Just took too long for delivery.,87615,4
87616,"While I believe that these shoes would have been great for my 3-year-old son on the beach, they were too large for his foot.",87616,4
87616,He normally wears an 8.5M and I ordered this shoe in a size 8M and it was sliding off of his heel when he walked.,87616,4
87616,"Because I was afraid that it would cause a blister once his feet got wet, I returned the shoes.",87616,4
87617,Very nice and it's just as it was describe.,87617,4
87619,they do not fit her size sneakers but will keep for the next size,87619,4
87620,It's a perfect size and shape with just the right number of pockets.,87620,4
87620,The only thing I'm hesitant about is how long it will hold up since I use it as an everday bag.,87620,4
87620,But the price is reasonable enough that I can just buy another one when this one wears out.,87620,4
87621,"This hat is adorable, I was going by previous comments/reviews on the size but I should have read the description that says 23 cm.",87621,4
87621,This didn't fit my two year old but she can use it with her stuffed animals and dolls.,87621,4
87622,I love these cubes but I was disappointed in the color purple that these were.,87622,4
87622,"It was more of a Barney or ""kiddie"" purple and I did not feel the color was age appropriate for me lol.",87622,4
87622,But the quality is impeccable!,87622,4
87622,"Very sturdy fabric and plastic interior, and the cubes themselves are deeper than most, being about 4"" deep.",87622,4
87622,That means you can pack a LOT of stuff in there!,87622,4
87623,Cute but not washable,87623,4
87624,Very cute alot of compliments ever time i wear but they do not stay on very well if head is facing downward .,87624,4
87625,I originally got this shirt to cover up my post baby belly.,87625,4
87625,But I wanted something also fashionable.,87625,4
87625,I wanted it to fall off my shoulder like the girl in the picture.,87625,4
87625,"It is nice and flowy and comes to med hip as expected however, It did not fall off of my shoulder as expected.",87625,4
87625,Nevertheless I will sport this pretty shirt.,87625,4
87625,It was worth the price.,87625,4
87628,"It's a little more simple than the photo shows, but still very cute.",87628,4
87628,You would have to bend it to get it to sit on your head as it does in the picture.,87628,4
87628,"It sits more flat, even at an angle.",87628,4
87628,"It works perfectly for what I'm using for, which is costuming.",87628,4
87628,I can add to it and dress it up to be closer to what it is in the picture.,87628,4
87628,"If you want fancy right out of the box, you'll be a little disappointed.",87628,4
87628,"It is a great starter hat, for anyone getting into costuming.",87628,4
87629,"im a womens xs in most European clothing and ordered a 2xl because i wanted a loose minimalist fit.very thin fabric, def not for sizes over US 8 in any size listed!!!!",87629,4
87629,2x fits likevUS Large!,87629,4
87631,Cool and unique shirt!,87631,4
87631,"The screenprint fades kind of quickly but on this shirt, it kind of adds to the ""deconstructed"" effect.",87631,4
87632,Fits on my feet.,87632,4
87633,"Soft, flowy, billowy shirt!",87633,4
87633,"Love the material, however the shirt was slightly large.",87633,4
87633,I ordered a small and it was still pretty big for me.,87633,4
87633,I usually wear small to medium tops.,87633,4
87633,"The back has a very low lace up design, so be prepared to try to find an undershirt or not wear a bra.",87633,4
87633,Overall nice top :),87633,4
87634,"Super cute, but the top is a little bit big.",87634,4
87635,"My 3 yo doesn't comment about the arch support, sorry",87635,4
87636,It's comfortable and fits like I expected it to.,87636,4
87636,"My only two complaints are the picture makes you think it's more of a glossy material, which it isn't, and it's pretty short, so it doesn't stay tucked in very well while at work.",87636,4
87636,Still not disappointed in it and will probably buy more colors.,87636,4
87637,"It's a cute cut from the back, but it does nothing to keep the girls in place.",87637,4
87638,"I would give 5 stars if I would have received the right color, the color/pattern I received was not even one of the options.",87638,4
87638,"However, these leggings are so comfortable and being in my 3rd-trimester pregnant, they do not even feel tight on my stomach.",87638,4
87638,Would buy again if I was sure to receive the right color...,87638,4
87639,Wanted a size 5 but has to settle for a 5/6.,87639,4
87639,A little big but my grandchild will grow into it,87639,4
87640,It is a fitted shirt and would help if said in description,87640,4
87641,The suit was larger than expected.,87641,4
87641,"I purposely bought medium, because I wanted it to fit a bit small, but it fit more like a large.",87641,4
87641,Still a great suit,87641,4
87642,"I bought these as a Christmas present for my daughter, who likes them.",87642,4
87642,"My only disappointment was that they arrived so late, after New Years Day even.",87642,4
87642,But maybe that couldn't be helped.,87642,4
87644,The hat is useless it was to small to fit on my 13 year old plus it doesn't keep any type of shape.,87644,4
87644,Besides that the rest of the costume is cute she loves it.,87644,4
87646,"My seven year old loves the hat, but be prepared to sew up some holes.",87646,4
87646,$10.00 is pretty cheap for this and it's because the construction is pretty poor.,87646,4
87646,I'm a decent sewer and I've had to repair it five times.,87646,4
87646,He loves it though!,87646,4
87647,"Build quality is alright, some of the stitching isn't straight/parallel, but the color is not what I was expecting.",87647,4
87647,The description says beige but the picture shows something that is pretty white to my eyes.,87647,4
87647,Maybe its me or my computer but I was expecting an off-whiteish color.,87647,4
87647,Just know going in that this is 100% beige and definitely not close to white.,87647,4
87647,"Unfortunately, I'll have to return this but I'm willing to give another Brandit product a shot.",87647,4
87648,I like this dress a lot.,87648,4
87648,Only complaint is that the shoulder straps/bust area are a little small.,87648,4
87648,My bra straps are always sticking out in a not-cute way.,87648,4
87648,It's a maternity dress-- pregnant women's boobs get really big-- why not give this dress better bust coverage?,87648,4
87649,"Nice shirt, My son really loved it",87649,4
87650,"I love vans for their versatility, but they really don't hold up in any job involving a lot of lifting, squatting etc.",87650,4
87650,"After 2 months on a delivery route, they're beat.",87650,4
87650,Rubber is coming unglued.,87650,4
87650,"And DO NOT put them in the wash, even on gentle with some towels.",87650,4
87650,Same goes for dryer on low heat.,87650,4
87650,Cracked the rubber but held their shape otherwise.,87650,4
87651,Cooler than I expected and very comfortable.,87651,4
87652,Top fits perfectly but the bottoms are a little snug but stretch,87652,4
87653,"Looks great but XXL did not fit, was too tight.",87653,4
87653,Would recommend for someone who wears a Large.,87653,4
87654,"In all honesty, I laughed hysterically when this dress came in the mail.",87654,4
87654,"It's a bit big, but not too bad.",87654,4
87654,"I bought it for Halloween anyways, so it's no big deal for me.",87654,4
87654,The colors are dramatically differing from the photo images.,87654,4
87654,"It will be great for my purpose, but not gonna be for daily wear with absolute certainty.",87654,4
87654,The shipping was great and fast.,87654,4
87654,Worth four stars alone.,87654,4
87655,"This is a nice, casual basic top but with style.",87655,4
87656,"As with the beige /white belt, this too is great looking.",87656,4
87656,It's bit loose because the fabric is stretchable.,87656,4
87656,I like it anyway.,87656,4
87657,Shown with metal clasp but had rubber or plastic.,87657,4
87657,Some had rough spots.,87657,4
87657,"However, that being said, those receiving the crosses were well pleased.",87657,4
87658,"Love it, was so nice to find a suit that fit and was comfortable.",87658,4
87659,I love Orthoheel sandals.,87659,4
87659,These were just not quite wide enough and the cross strap hit the top of my foot on a sensitive area.,87659,4
87659,I'll be trying another style though.,87659,4
87659,They are normally so comfortable.,87659,4
87660,It's hard to find the right fitting hats and this looks pretty good.,87660,4
87660,I gave one to my daughter and she really likes it too.,87660,4
87661,Looks the way it does on post.,87661,4
87661,Material is like a t-shirt.,87661,4
87661,"Im 5'2"" 115lbs so this fits me like picture on the site does so I like it.",87661,4
87661,Shipping time was a long time but for what you pay for its not bad.,87661,4
87661,I feel this shirt is meant for sizes 2-6 and bigger will fit literally like a t-shirt vs. a oversized shirt dress like the pic so keep that in mind.,87661,4
87661,Hope this review helps.,87661,4
87662,I wish this would affect me it does run small that is so beautiful that I kept it and give it to my niece she lives on the beach shell and joy it,87662,4
87663,Many people say to order a size up but if you are shorter definitely order the size you usually are.,87663,4
87663,"I am about 5'2"", ordered a medium and it is much longer than I want it to be",87663,4
87664,I love this clear box.,87664,4
87664,Alot of likes from co workers.,87664,4
87664,The only down fall is the chain became loose where it connects to the purse.,87664,4
87665,The dress is really nice.,87665,4
87665,You should measure yourself before ordering.,87665,4
87665,We did and the dress fits perfectly.,87665,4
87665,"The quality isn't the greatest, but it's a beautiful dress.",87665,4
87665,Perfect for a junior bridesmaid who will probably only wear it once!,87665,4
87665,We are happy with it.,87665,4
87666,Cute slicker - my son loves it.,87666,4
87666,It's not super high quality but it won't fit him in a year anyway so I'm not really worried about longevity.,87666,4
87667,My 3 year old LOVES Superman... this is a great set of jammies for summer!,87667,4
87668,Fits my largish head just fine and will even work with my glasses on the outside.,87668,4
87668,Presents a stylish and professional appearance.,87668,4
87669,"It's just what I needed, it's a lot smaller and heavier than I thought... but it's perfect for what I needed...",87669,4
87670,I'm normally size US14.,87670,4
87670,I bought 5XL and it is somewhat large.,87670,4
87670,"The bottom piece fits fine, but the top is loose, and also the cups are big.",87670,4
87670,"I normally wear bra size 38C, but this top feels like 40D.",87670,4
87670,"I guess that 4XL would have been perfect for my measurements, but I'm keeping it.",87670,4
87670,The material is amazing.,87670,4
87670,Great value for money.,87670,4
87671,Came on time actually came before they time it was placed on wife loves it but the NOT FOR SALE was not in photo,87671,4
87672,I am a 4-6 and the medium top is snug.,87672,4
87672,No way I could fit in the bottoms.,87672,4
87672,Really cute bathing suit though and a great price.,87672,4
87672,Just pay really close attention to sizing when purchasing.,87672,4
87673,Much better than I expected!,87673,4
87673,Arrived in perfect condition.,87673,4
87673,I have this to my mother as part of her mother's day gift and she oohed and awwed and said it was very pretty.,87673,4
87673,(Well what good mother wouldn't?),87673,4
87673,But I really think she was being sincere.,87673,4
87673,I was very pleased with this purchase.,87673,4
87673,It us a lovery brooch.,87673,4
87674,"Too small, very cute but prefer Beth style",87674,4
87675,Sexy as expected but could be a bit more form fitting,87675,4
87676,"I received my handbag today, I open the box it has a odor, I took the handbag outside ,I hope it will take away the odor, if not I will be sending it back.",87676,4
87676,The handbags looks just like the picture.,87676,4
87676,"If anyone knows how to eliminate the order please let me know, I would hate to returned the handbag it's soooooo cute.",87676,4
87676,If it wasn't for the odor I would had gave it 5 stars.,87676,4
87677,I'm 5'3 about 110 and they fit pretty good.,87677,4
87677,A little long but I didn't expect them to be perfect for the price.,87677,4
87678,I ordered three different Travelon Anti-Theft bags for my upcoming international trip.,87678,4
87678,This is the medium size bag and has the features I'm looking for.,87678,4
87678,High on my list are the zippered side pockets that will hold water bottles.,87678,4
87678,A bonus was the RFID wallet.,87678,4
87678,Since the bag has the RFID for passport & credit cards I may leave the wallet at home and use it for every day.,87678,4
87678,At any rate it was a bonus-I actually considered an RFID billfold before deciding on the anti-theft bag.,87678,4
87678,"I wish this came in Navy, but this color will work.",87678,4
87678,I have to carry two thick glasses cases and both fit easily in this bag either vertically or horizontally with ample space left over.,87678,4
87678,My camera is my new iPhone SE so that has it's own outside pocket for easy access.,87678,4
87679,i do not like it,87679,4
87680,Only reason not five stars is it sits rather low on chest .,87680,4
87681,I need to wear something under the blouse because it's sheer.,87681,4
87681,The necklace can be removed from the shirt.,87681,4
87681,Each end has a clasp.,87681,4
87681,The way the chain is crimped onto the clasp is sloppy because sharp metal comes out of the sheath and it is sharp!,87681,4
87681,I had hoped to connect the clasps to each other but it's best to wear the blouse as photographed.,87681,4
87682,It is cute and holds most of my stuff!!,87682,4
87682,If you fill it with too much change or bills it won't close all the way.,87682,4
87682,But it is too cute not to keep!,87682,4
87682,It does hold all my cards!,87682,4
87683,"This was a little small, but I was able to securely pin it using bobby pins so it worked fine for my costume.",87683,4
87683,I can usually fit into large children's helmets or regular women's hats/helmets.,87683,4
87684,Would have loved it except it fit my friend way too small and it was a gift for her.,87684,4
87684,She is a 36D but has a small torso and is small with some curves.,87684,4
87684,I ordered her a large but am now returning it.,87684,4
87684,Return process is amazing!,87684,4
87684,They are so helpful!,87684,4
87684,I would recommend this but size up maybe two times.,87684,4
87685,The look just like the photo,87685,4
87686,Not too thick and has the cord to keep from getting lost.,87686,4
87687,I liked it just fine.,87687,4
87687,I bought it because I needed scrubs for work and I  like that it is made of cotton and it fits the way it should.,87687,4
87687,Not too tight and not too big or too loose.,87687,4
87687,I wonder though if I should buy a larger size for winter so that I could wear a long sleeve underneath we will see.,87687,4
87688,"The top is smaller than a sports bra, but the skirt fits perfect!",87688,4
87689,just like the photo.,87689,4
87690,I love this shirt....,87690,4
87690,But I would say the 6 month is more a 3 month!,87690,4
87691,"the top is tricky to fit, I thought for sure with a 36D I would be a large top, but I had to return because it was simply too large that it fell too low on my chest and was too close to the private part.",87691,4
87691,"I think it really depends on if you have augmentation or not, I think it will fit differently depends on high up your chest is naturally or unnaturally.",87691,4
87692,"very cute cowgirl hat , lightweight and attractive",87692,4
87693,"Read reviews, bought a size up, too big but not swimming in it.",87693,4
87694,"It fits nicely but the material will ""pill"" up as previously comment.",87694,4
87694,I would give it a 4.,87694,4
87695,These are great but run small.,87695,4
87695,"My baby is 5 months, weighs about 16-17 lbs and wears the 12 month (6-12) size.",87695,4
87696,Fits perfect and Looks good on,87696,4
87697,"For the price, decent costume for an Octoberfest party.",87697,4

87697,"Tight around the ribcage, so go a size up.",87697,4
87698,A little small but very cool ...got a lot of compliments,87698,4
87699,Took along time to arrive (I didn't notice it had to come from China!),87699,4
87699,but my 13 year old loved it!,87699,4
87700,"great for sexy time, nice fit",87700,4
87701,Orange should have been darker.,87701,4
87702,Product meets my expectations and was a good cost value too.,87702,4
87703,"Love the hat, measured  my head, large said to small for my measurement.",87703,4
87703,I ordered  the  XL size and it's a little  big but a sweat band on my head makes it fit.,87703,4
87703,Think the sizes are off on hat,87703,4
87704,The only thing I would change is I wish it was just a little bit longer,87704,4
87706,The inside of the boot is fuzzy and warm.,87706,4
87706,I wish that it came up a little higher on the leg.,87706,4
87707,Can dress up a black tank and jeans easy.,87707,4
87708,The price was great.,87708,4
87709,"really pretty, but you kind of have to be pretty busty to fill it out.",87709,4
87709,fits me everywhere if i just wear a padded bra.,87709,4
87709,otherwise good material and all.,87709,4
87710,"The shirt itself is really nice and very well made, the fabric is a nice weight.",87710,4
87710,Not too stiff and not too thin.,87710,4
87710,"It just runs really small, like three sizes too small.",87710,4
87710,It could have been mislabeled?,87710,4
87710,I'd love it if it weren't tiny.,87710,4
87712,"It's a nice hoodie and the length is great, I got a medium and it's a little big but not bad, will definitely wear it more in spring",87712,4

87716,Since then I've had multiple compliments.,87716,4
87716,"I do have to fix the earrings, they do fall down and dangle occasionally.",87716,4
87716,My one complaint is that because the stars are made straight in a row the star at the end stick out away from the ears.,87716,4
87716,But for the price I think its worth it.,87716,4
87716,You do  have to be gentle with it.,87716,4
87716,"I could see the star or the post bending, i haven't had any issues so far but i do take it off before bed and a shower.",87716,4
87716,I would buy this again!,87716,4
87717,Read reviews and seemed like I ordered size accordingly.,87717,4
87717,"Yes, they are tight but I believe dampening them and stretching them a bit while wearing them will allow them to fit me comfortably.",87717,4
87719,It's a fantastic suit.,87719,4
87719,I've gotten Lots of compliments wearing it.,87719,4
87720,Even prettier in person.,87720,4
87720,I am 5'1 and it was long...more for a beach cover up or maybe something you wear with leggings.,87720,4
87720,The arms are lose except where it is seamed at the bottom which is  very small!,87720,4
87720,So if you have larger arms it will fit very tightly around your bicep.,87720,4
87721,Bought as a gift for grandson.,87721,4
87723,"Love the hidden pocket, real comfy and fits well!",87723,4

87728,Very cute and warm winter outfit!,87728,4
87728,"The only thing I did not like was the gap in the diaper area, otherwise it's the perfect Christmas outfit!",87728,4
87729,But the sleeves are wierd,87729,4
87730,The pink one comes really small... other than that i like the product,87730,4
87731,Beautiful dress with nice design and at a very cheap price.,87731,4
87731,I will recommend it.,87731,4
87732,The swim dress is of excellent quality!,87732,4
87732,The sizing is probably fine too.,87732,4
87732,I am a bit small for the 6-8 and a bit large for the 4-6.,87732,4
87732,I went with the larger because I probably won't ever get wet anyway.,87732,4
87732,"If I was a water person, I would probably have got with the smaller since they usually get baggier when wet.",87732,4
87732,I would certainly recommend the sit for style and quality.,87732,4
87733,This is good quality for the price.,87733,4
87733,I ordered the SM/Med.,87733,4
87733,I am 5'4 and the dress comes right above my knees.,87733,4
87733,I usually wear XS or Small sizes in clothing and this dress is a perfect fit.,87733,4
87733,It says it fits up to 140 lb but I think it would be a very tight fit.,87733,4
87733,It came a little wrinkled but hopefully they will fall out before time to wear the dress.,87733,4
87734,Tons of compliments just wish it for a tad bit bigger,87734,4
87735,"I am very petite, 5'0 and 110 lbs but the small fit a lot better than I expected.",87735,4
87735,I love the white and the blue color.,87735,4
87735,"The bottom/shorts are a little big, but it makes it look more of like a skirt which is still cute.",87735,4
87735,"Overall, I love the purchase.",87735,4
87735,The deep neckline makes me look a lot taller and has an element of classiness infused with a sexy style.,87735,4
87736,I bit tight near thighs,87736,4
87737,I don't like it two of the four buttons work threw it in the junk draw waste of my money.,87737,4
87737,This just could of been a defect it happens,87737,4
87738,"4 stars for style and quality, but this swimsuit is NOT FOR WOMEN WITH LONG TORSOS!",87738,4
87738,"If you are, let's say 5'7"" tall or taller, just skip it.",87738,4
87738,"Also, it does run about 1 size smaller than listed.",87738,4
87738,"Here's what it does for my wife, who is 5'8"" tall.",87738,4
87738,"The material (spanning between the top and bottom) is not particularly stretchy, so it pulls tight, pulling the top down, and making it difficult for her to keep the top in place.",87738,4
87738,It also causes the material to pull tight and lift off her body.,87738,4
87738,"That gives the illusion of making her look thicker than she is, which is never a look women are particularly fond of.",87738,4
87738,"I bet if you're shorter (say, 5'5""), this would fit great for length, and be really cute.",87738,4
87738,"Unfortunately, we'll have to return it.",87738,4
87739,Fits ok but the sizing confusing,87739,4
87740,"(First Review: It's blue, brown, and grey and does not have the design that is shown.)",87740,4
87740,Edit: The seller e-mailed me and the customer service was fantastic.,87740,4
87740,"Although the dress is not what I wanted, the seller really went above and beyond to get this fixed.",87740,4
87740,Increased review due to the customer service.,87740,4
87741,"Very bright color, super cute with a cardigan.",87741,4
87741,"But it does fit a little ""loose"" in the chest area, it sags on the sides and in the front.",87741,4
87741,I have a large chest 38E so you'll just have to be careful.,87741,4
87741,But it is a great summer dress.,87741,4
87742,Received this very quickly.,87742,4
87742,It is very pretty and I do not even like gold tones.,87742,4
87742,But I really like this.,87742,4
87743,Nice dress but it's fuller in the chest area than expected,87743,4
87744,The top is beautiful but seems a little small.,87744,4
87744,The fabric is a nice weight not thin and flimsy.,87744,4
87744,There is lace near the shoulder that I didn't see online and I love it.,87744,4
87745,"Sizing is small compared to typical US sizes, so order one size up.",87745,4
87745,"I like the underwear overall, but they are ""too tight"" around the leg even one size up.",87745,4
87745,"If you have big/developed legs, they probably won't fit right.",87745,4
87746,"It is a good product, just not what I think I really needed.",87746,4
87746,I have long necklaces which don't really have a place in here.,87746,4
87746,"However, it is really good for bracelets, rings, and earrings and also for a few makeup products on the go!",87746,4
87748,Wasn't as realistic and locket looking as the picture,87748,4
87749,I recommend going a size up.,87749,4
87749,"I am 5'6"", 135 pounds, and typically wear size 4 bottoms.",87749,4
87749,"I went with a medium based on other reviews, and I'm glad I did.",87749,4
87749,"Even just wearing them once, I can already tell they will ride up my leg into my crotch, but I intend to wear them with tights/leggings underneath for aerial silks/lyra classes so I am not too concerned about that (I'm hoping the leggings will keep my jiggly thighs in place!",87749,4
87750,Bottoms seem a little small,87750,4
87751,I love this top.,87751,4
87751,Took along time to arrive!,87751,4
87751,Neck line is weird but the entire look is pro Star Wars and what I was looking for.,87751,4
87751,Great for those Goth looks as well.,87751,4
87752,This belly band has great elasticity and is very comfortable.,87752,4
87755,These earrings are a very pretty shade of red.,87755,4
87755,They look nice on also.,87755,4
87756,"I'm a little big, so I have this problem frequently.",87756,4
87756,"It only falls short by a few inches, can be easily extended",87756,4
87757,It arrived quickly in a lovely gift box.,87757,4
87758,My husband love it.,87758,4
87759,"Well, I just reviewed the wrong pants, so I will try again, very comfy, like pajamas, wore them to my trip to Mexico and went into the ocean with them when I got there and just rinse them in the shower and dried naturally by the sun and wore them again on my way back at the end of the week.",87759,4
87759,"Purchased two more colors when I got home but the material feels different, fit the same, hope they will do as great as this.",87759,4
87759,"10/05/16 update to the new beige pair, it does feel and wear much different that green blue I purchased earlier, still very comfy but elastic waist and material are not the same, still keep my rating until I try the green pair",87759,4
87762,I love the colors of this blouse they are true to the picture.,87762,4
87762,I wish that the cut was a little more flattering it comes to weird point in the front.,87762,4
87762,"Other than that most of the blouses like this that I have ordered in the past do not allow me to reach above my head, this blouse does which is great.",87762,4
87762,The sleeves are open on the ends enough that my forearm does not get stuck but not so huge that the sleeve falls back down my arm.,87762,4
87762,"The length if this blouse is perfect it falls to the middle of my rump, with bending and moving all day at work this is ideal for me so I am not showing off my crack.",87762,4
87763,"Cute necklace, arrived on time with no major damages.",87763,4
87763,"I did reinforce the link because of previous reviews, just wanted to be safe.",87763,4
87763,"Otherwise no complaints, and received lots of compliments on it.",87763,4
87764,Super cute well fitting tankini,87764,4
87765,I'm a medium and it fits.,87765,4
87766,"The bracelet runs small , it was very tight on our wrists .",87766,4
87766,The design is very nice though .,87766,4
87768,They're a little overly rounded on the front for my taste and would prefer ones that are more flat.,87768,4
87769,"Exactly what I expected, a little loose but perfect casual summer dress",87769,4
87770,"Fits just right in the body, but the sleeves are a little short.",87770,4
87770,That's just how things go when you order from overseas!,87770,4
87770,Knocked off one star for the neck strings doing nothing.,87770,4
87771,"I just got this watch today.. it's beautiful, the reason why  put 4 start only because it's a bit big than what I expected.. over all is good ..",87771,4
87772,Nicely made bra at a very good price,87772,4
87773,I sent them back twice because the white is not a true white.,87773,4
87773,"First I orders pearlized white and they were more a cream, then order just white and they were the exact same as the pearlized.",87773,4
87773,I have the same pair in a different color and really like them.,87773,4
87773,Too bad the white didn't work out.,87773,4
87774,smaller than expected compare to all my other coca cola tin sign,87774,4
87776,cute but i have a big head,87776,4
87777,"I like it but it is quite wide, a bit tent like, I know that's what shift dresses are supposed to be like (some wider, some less wide, this one is definitely on the wider side) but I guess I've tried some shift dresses that fitted me better.",87777,4
87777,"It is like the description, beautiful color and nice fabric, I just don't love how I look in it but I will still use it for sure.",87777,4
87777,"I'm 5.6, 115 lb and ordered a small and fits perfect.",87777,4
87781,"Unfortunately, I bought the 14, following the information here that the item is much too small.",87781,4
87781,I got a legit 14.,87781,4
87781,"Utterly swallows my 9 year old, who wears a 10-12 normally.",87781,4
87781,"Also unfortunately, I got it for his birthday, and I'm one day past the return window.",87781,4
87781,Don't know what  I'm going to do with a shirt that is two sizes too big -- he won't fit into this shirt for at least two more years.,87781,4
87781,Odds that he'll still be into Minecraft then??,87781,4
87783,"After reading some reviews, it was pretty apparent that this shirt is in Asian sizing not U.S. so I ordered my size according to Asian standards which is usually 2 sizes up.",87783,4
87783,I wear an American medium so I ordered an XL.,87783,4
87783,"Like others have said, the seller is now sending a size up from the ordered size so I received an XXL.",87783,4
87783,It's a little big but it's for a costume and I don't mind it loose.,87783,4
87783,"If you have really thick arms, this might not work unless you go up several sizes so be aware.",87783,4
87783,I'm a little disappointed I ordered the right size and received even larger but the quality is great for the price.,87783,4
87784,good n love it,87784,4
87786,Wasn't nearly as flowy as I was expecting it to be.,87786,4
87786,Sleeves are also shorter than expected.,87786,4
87787,These underwear are a roulette wheel.,87787,4
87787,"One pair is too small, one too large (read baggy large), another fits perfectly and one is short in the rear.",87787,4
87787,I have not tried on the last pair.,87787,4
87787,These stay as my back up bloomers in the back of the drawer.,87787,4
87789,"Great shirt, but a bit more snug than I had expected.",87789,4
87791,"I love the dress, but it is very form fitting.",87791,4
87791,"Which of course is not a bad thing, I would just recommend getting it a size larger than needed.",87791,4
87791,"Also, I wouldn't categorize this as a dress...it's a slightly long shirt.",87791,4
87792,I paid $40 for a different kind & these Yulee ones are great!!,87792,4
87792,The only thing that I have a issue with is that these are not one size fits ALL!,87792,4
87792,Maybe one size fit's all for people that wear a size 7/8-13/14 Jr. Or size 6-14 woman's.,87792,4
87792,If your very very thin these may be to big especially the top part that is made to slim down your mid section.,87792,4
87792,If your plus sized like me or just carry a lot of weight in your stomach then the top will drive you nuts it folds down & won't stay up!!,87792,4
87792,I knew these probably wouldn't fit me just yet when I ordered them though!,87792,4
87792,I gained 90lbs from my medication!!,87792,4
87792,I have to switch meds to lose it & I need surgery first.,87792,4
87792,Anyways these are the best kind I've bought!,87792,4
87792,And I've tried 5-6 different kinds & brand's.,87792,4
87793,"I liked these, they were just not the right size, they didn't give me any hassle to return it.",87793,4
87794,I bought this hat for a Carmen SanDiego Halloween costume and it worked perfectly.,87794,4
87794,The quality is what you would expect for the price and for use with a costume.,87794,4
87794,"It came with a red ribbon, not a black one as seen in the photo, but this wasn't an issue for me since I covered it with a yellow ribbon for the costume.",87794,4
87794,It arrived in a timely manner and didn't get squished in the box.,87794,4
87795,Fits well and very cute.,87795,4
87795,Only complaint is the top portion is a little more see through than I would prefer.,87795,4
87799,It fits really well and the material is not thin at all..Money's worth..will update with a picture for better idea,87799,4
87800,"Fit perfect but to long I'm only 5'1"" so I had to hem it",87800,4
87801,"However, one was missing the snap.",87801,4
87803,"Comfortable with good support, I like the wide waistband for winter.",87803,4
87803,It keeps a t-shirt tucked.,87803,4
87803,White ones have a nasty stiff tag in back that hopefull will soften with washing.,87803,4
87804,"Even if the pajamas are bigger than expected, I'm keeping them.",87804,4
87804,I am not thin person and they are very comfortable.,87804,4
87805,"It is beautiful and excellent quality for its price but was big for my wrist, so if you have small wrists like me, this piece runs big.",87805,4
87806,It runs large on top and a little snug at the waist.,87806,4
87807,This is a nice purse but it's a little too small for me to use.,87807,4
87808,I love the weight of this necklace.,87808,4
87808,"I bought it for my Mom for Valentines Day, she loves it.",87808,4
87808,I wish the gold metal didn't look so 'foilish' though.,87808,4
87808,I would purchase again.,87808,4
87810,This halter top is so cute!,87810,4
87810,I love the way that it ties in the back.,87810,4
87810,"The only reason I gave it four stars was in the picture it looks like it covers everything, but unfortunately it is very see through.",87810,4
87811,"Little bigger than I wanted, little heavier than expected, and has a slight odor - which I'm hoping dissipates with time.",87811,4
87811,Would like the top to open wider.,87811,4
87811,There are about 2 inches on each side that don't open.,87811,4
87811,"I like it, though, and will keep it.",87811,4
87813,It runs small though!,87813,4
87813,Size up one-two sizes.,87813,4
87814,The top works well for me.,87814,4
87814,"It was a little thinner than I thought, I am 5ft 1inch 119 pounds a 34D and I got the medium, I could have gone with the large, although it looks great with the blue skirt.",87814,4
87814,"I have one just like the photo, only mine is blue and I like the contrast.",87814,4
87814,I was looking for a shirt exactly like this to match an Audrey Hepburn .,87814,4
87816,pretty but the waist is too big as compared dresses in this size,87816,4
87817,These were bought for an all white party.,87817,4
87817,They were comfortable and fit well.,87817,4
87817,They seemed well made as well.,87817,4
87818,she wears it so must be ok,87818,4
87819,Happy with the product!,87819,4
87820,not as slouchy as i would have liked...,87820,4
87821,"I ordered a 2xl thinking it'd be a little big since I'm a size 14, nope real snug.",87821,4
87821,I squeezed into it and wore it all day yesterday and it was pretty comfortable.,87821,4
87821,It did get here really fast too.,87821,4
87821,"Update- we are now couple months out and I had to cut out the metal in the two back areas, they were bending and digging into my back.",87821,4
87822,"It is a lovely ring, and my husband finds it very comfortable!",87822,4
87824,Great belt for the price.,87824,4
87824,After getting the first belt I have ordered it in 2 other colors.,87824,4
87824,Can be worn with jeans or nice pants.,87824,4
87825,love the way it fits!,87825,4
87825,super flirty cant wait to show it off for the boyfriend!,87825,4
87826,Fit well and didn't have a problem with it riding up.,87826,4
87827,It's exactly as detailed by seller,87827,4
87828,"Gerber clothing tends to run smaller than other brands, but since I knew that I ordered a size up and it's ok.",87828,4
87828,The outfit is fine otherwise.,87828,4
87829,These belts are a lot cuter in person than as pictured.,87829,4
87829,"They are 42"" in length and have 6 holes.",87829,4
87829,"They definitely seem to be more for fashion than function, but for the price I'll let them live out there short lives as long as they last.",87829,4
87829,The variety and colors you get are nice especially for the price.,87829,4
87829,"I didn't expect them to be some fancy belts, and they aren't, but overall they are nice.",87829,4
87829,I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a few different belts for different occassions.,87829,4
87830,My first order made was too large.,87830,4
87830,This is my second order & fits me slightly bigger than usual even though it is 1 size smaller than the usual shorts or pants that I order.,87830,4
87831,"is cute, but way to small, the size small fit my 9 year old dougther she weight 54 lb",87831,4
87832,Very cute and stretchy cows,87832,4
87833,Fit as expected mostly but arms run a little short but super cute and comfy,87833,4
87834,They're nice but a little tight.,87834,4
87834,Was hoping the adjustment would of been better.,87834,4
87834,Also they can only be worn behind the neck in case you didn't know!),87834,4
87834,They do work and keep my ears warm - but feels kind of cheaply made and like they'll eventually break.,87834,4
87835,Price gor what i wad looking for.,87835,4
87836,"just a little see through, but not a big deal with the pattern.",87836,4
87837,I just put a little fashion tape to make sure the shoulders stay and I can dance the whole night away.,87837,4
87838,Like the bag but it's allot smaller than what I anticipated.,87838,4
87839,The shirt fit as expected after I washed it and it shrank a full size.,87839,4
87839,I bought the large for my son who wears a medium because it's 100% cotton.,87839,4
87839,"And it shrank up in the wash just like I expected, and now fits my son perfectly.",87839,4
87839,So definitely order a size larger than you need.,87839,4
87840,Ever so slightly small but still fits.,87840,4
87840,Very cute and looks exactly like the photo.,87840,4
87841,I'm 5'9'' and 120lbs with a long torso and this fits more like a tunic on me.,87841,4
87841,Still very cute with leggings though!,87841,4
87843,"After reading other reviews, I decided to go one size larger, turned out to be a wrong decision.",87843,4
87843,"It was too long for my short frame, also top part was way to big.",87843,4
87843,The color in pix appears as a pale pink but is a bright pink.,87843,4
87843,It is a beautiful swimdress though!,87843,4
87844,I had to return mine.,87844,4
87844,But the boot was nice looking and well made.,87844,4
87845,They look good and seem to be of decent quality but are a bit loose on the bottoms.,87845,4
87845,Not a big deal but joggers usually fit snug at the bottom.,87845,4
87845,Price is very good.,87845,4
87846,"The color is emerald green, not as pictured.",87846,4
87847,Love Carters and this will look very cute on my son for the summer.,87847,4
87847,"I only wish I had checked my local stores first, bc this outfit was there for a few dollars less.",87847,4
87848,Great looking for the price.,87848,4
87849,Good for one time use.,87849,4
87849,My son used it as a ringbearer and the legs ripped on the sides by the end of the night.,87849,4
87850,"I paid for quality and that's what I received, but the pin was considerably smaller (5/8""x5/8"") than I expected.",87850,4
87851,"just wish the white material was made of cotton, gets really hot with this material",87851,4
87852,"Love the color and the fabric, so soft and really flattering",87852,4
87853,"Good shirt, I felt like a pirate.",87853,4
87854,Fits a little small don't wear it around the ATL all the hipsters will know it's a knock off but the textiles wash really great regardless,87854,4
87855,I absolutely love these pants!,87855,4
87855,The only problem I have with them is the fact that if I fold them the print will stick together and it'll mess up.,87855,4
87855,Even when I received the item the print was a bit cracked and sticked together.,87855,4
87855,But aside from that they fit perfectly.,87855,4
87856,gave me a sophisticated look,87856,4
87857,The arms are not as long as I would like but it is very soft and comfortable.,87857,4
87858,"I've only used the horseshoe so far, but for this price I think its pretty good.",87858,4
87858,Only complaint was that one of the needles was bent.,87858,4
87861,"Before I washed it, it was so big and unflattering.",87861,4
87861,I ordered my normal size.,87861,4
87861,"Once I wash and dried it, it fit pertectly!!",87861,4
87861,I would definitely find a small brown belt to go on the waist of it for a better final look.,87861,4
87862,"I like the color and material of these shorts, but I'm undecided about the style.",87862,4
87862,I ordered them to go under a mint tutu for an outfit I was modeling at a photoshoot.,87862,4
87862,"I purchased the large because according to the size chart, that's the size I needed.",87862,4
87862,"When they arrived, I was actually quite surprised by how comfortable the material is, however, they are a lot longer than I thought they were going to me.",87862,4
87862,"First, they fit great.",87862,4
87862,"Not loose, not too tight, but when I button them up, they go above my belly button and the legs are much longer.",87862,4
87862,They look shorter on the model.,87862,4
87862,I needed a short pair for under the tutu as it was just supposed to be a way to hide my underwear from the sheerness of the tulle and the tutu was quite short so we didn't want anything that would be longer than the tutu.,87862,4
87862,These shorts met mid thigh for me.,87862,4
87862,I have other shorts in the exact same size and they were no where near this big or long.,87862,4
87862,Nothing a few alterations can't fix.,87862,4
87862,We just rolled the legs up a bit and the waist rolled down.,87862,4
87862,It's just weird how they fit me.,87862,4
87862,"Nothing wrong with the shorts themselves, I don't think.",87862,4
87862,It's just that all bodies are made differently and they just personally fit me in a weird way.,87862,4
87862,"We still got them to work for what we wanted them for, though, so I'm happy.",87862,4
87863,The bottoms are super cute but they kinda fit like panties .,87863,4
87863,well on me lol .,87863,4
87863,but the top is okay the neck part is to loose .,87863,4
87864,I made it work although it is a maternity skirt.,87864,4
87865,"Nice fit for a 20"" neck as long as you only want to do a four-in-hand.",87865,4
87865,"I tried to do a full Windsor and the tie was too short, unless I wanted the narrow end to be only about 2"" long and sticking out from behind the knot.",87865,4
87865,"Decent quality, looks good.",87865,4
87865,"It arrived folded, and had a bit of a crease.",87865,4
87866,Very light and comfortable great for thoes warm summer days,87866,4
87867,Wish they was a bit longer.,87867,4
87867,Going to use them for a bell cosplay.,87867,4
87868,"Run true size, Very sexy and classy with out looking thrashing.",87868,4
87869,"its going to need altered due to poor alignment, and you better be ready to weave all that together",87869,4
87870,"I'm 5'6"" 130lbs and ordered and medium - fits perfectly.",87870,4
87870,Material is thin but light and perfect for Florida heat!,87870,4
87870,Would totally order again.,87870,4
87871,I was a little bit unsure what to expect when I first made the purchase of buying the swimsuit.,87871,4
87871,"After reading mixed reviews I didn't have my hopes up too high, so when I got the package, which debt arrived very quickly, I guess that it met my expectations.",87871,4
87871,"I expected the product to be a little bit tight, which it was, but not overwhelmingly small so that is something to keep in mind.",87871,4
87871,"Typically I fit into a medium swimsuit, and I decided to just continue with that size and buy this one in a medium, despite customer reviews and disappointment from other offbrand swimsuit Look-alikes that have tended to run quite small.",87871,4
87871,I was not disappointed.,87871,4
87871,"Like I said, the fit was slightly small, but that does not to take away from the quality of the material.",87871,4
87871,"The colors have not yet faded but I have not wash the swimsuit, only let it air dry after a vacation.",87871,4
87871,The colors are very true to the picture and are very bright.,87871,4
87871,"The bottoms are what run a little bit tight, but I am a 5 foot five teen who weighs a little less than 120 pounds.",87871,4
87871,"My bra size is a 32C in most cases, and I was very pleased with the fit of the top.",87871,4
87871,"Only one adjustment setting, but over all the cups fit nice on my breasts, but the front material is a little thin.",87871,4
87871,I will probably be using padding from other similar swimsuit styles just to make sure that my nipples don't pop through.,87871,4
87871,"Then again, TMI, but my nipples pop through a lot of things when I'm not wearing padding, so if you don't have that problem you probably will be just fine.",87871,4
87871,"If I adjust the top correctly, there is no peep show though, so it just depends on the person and how their body is built!",87871,4
87871,"Overall a very good purchase and I would recommend to people, as the quality is fairly high and extremely similar to that of the Triangl brand.",87871,4
87872,Love the look of this purse but after reading another review about the handle coming apart after one use I am determined to handle the purse with care and not to use it on a daily basis.,87872,4
87872,It being a patent bag You would not want to use it on a daily basis anyway.,87872,4
87872,"I have used this purse once without any problems, but I was very careful with it too.",87872,4
87873,This is such a cute swimsuit!,87873,4
87873,I have been trying to find a high waisted swimsuit to hide my sad saggy mommy tummy after having 3 kids!,87873,4
87873,Even though I have lost all the weight things just aren't the same so I figured a high waisted suit would do the job!,87873,4
87873,I ordered a medium because I always need a little bigger on top to accommodate nursing boobs!,87873,4
87873,I wish you could order the tops and bottoms separately because the bottoms were a little too big and the top was much too small.,87873,4
87873,"The cups are like too close together or something and the girls were spilling out of the top, bottoms and sides haha!!!",87873,4
87873,My pant size is a 0 or 2 and bra is 34D to give you an idea of what size you might need to buy.,87873,4
87873,I ended up giving the suit to a friend since I couldn't fit in it but I really wish it would have fit me because it was so cute!,87873,4
87874,will know more when trains,87874,4
87876,Great bag so far.,87876,4
87876,I have only had it for a month.,87876,4
87876,"If I fill it to much, I have a hard time zipping it.",87876,4
87876,This is because the top front of the bag leans in.,87876,4
87876,You can see this in the picture.,87876,4
87876,"If it was straight, I would not have a problem.",87876,4
87876,It has a zipper in the back by the handle bar where I put my keys and work badge.,87876,4
87876,I use the side mesh pocket for extra sunglasses and a drink.,87876,4
87876,"Inside has a small pocket where I put a pen, ipod, earphones, pocket mirror etc.",87876,4
87876,"The main pocket I put my small backpack purse, dress shoes & my lunchbox.",87876,4
87876,"Handle lifts, slides and locks easily.",87876,4
87876,The 4 wheels make it easy to maneuver.,87876,4
87876,"I tried dragging it behind me, but it tips to far and hits the ground.",87876,4
87876,I currently just glide it next to me.,87876,4
87876,The handles are great for carrying it.,87876,4
87876,I pick it up and walk up 1 flight of stairs (I keep the metal handle up) then just start wheeling again when I reach the top.,87876,4
87876,I have received several positive comments on this bag.,87876,4
87876,I gave it 4 stars because I have not had it long and I wish the zipper had a little more flexibility when slightly over stuffed.,87876,4
87877,I'm 5ft tall and about 150 lbs the top fit like item photo.,87877,4
87877,"Length was accurate, and I ordered a large.",87877,4
87878,They're very sexy ordered a small which didn't fit right and was kindly sent a size up at no charge definitely would recommend this.,87878,4
87878,pouch in the front holds the boys nicely,87878,4
87879,"Fits a little large, but I'm 5"" 4 100 pounds so I expected that.",87879,4
87880,"The plug is on the top of the shoes and open,  so I wouldn't recommend wearing them when it's raining.",87880,4
87882,I just wish there were more colors.,87882,4
87882,Only issue I have is after the first time of pulling them up they ripped a little hole in the seam where the leg meets the booty.,87882,4
87882,They felt more durable so I was surprised.,87882,4
87882,"It's not a deal breaker as I would purchase them again, Her little black dress covers the hole anyways.",87882,4
87883,This top is absolutely beautiful.,87883,4
87883,The only reason I gave it four stars instead of 5 is that I'm not sure how well it will hold up after washing it a few times and that its a little shorter in the front than I would like.,87883,4
87883,"However, the top is beautiful and elegany, it can be dressed up or down, is sexy and stylish.",87883,4
87883,I ordered a size 22 and I feel its true to size.,87883,4
87884,"I knew it would be somewhat small, so I ordered one size up.",87884,4
87884,The zipper stitching was ripped.,87884,4
87884,I'll have to exchange it for another one.,87884,4
87885,I am quite happy with this item.,87885,4
87886,I really like the way these make everything look.,87886,4
87886,They are truly polarized.,87886,4
87886,Great sunglasses to have and not expensive.,87886,4
87886,These are a must have if you need a cheap pair that look good and are still polarized,87886,4
87888,"it was a little too tight on the tummy area, probaly should of got a large other than that light weight and silky soft looks nice on for sure",87888,4
87889,The padding in this bralette is a litter strange and doesn't offer that much support.,87889,4
87889,"It feels a bit like a training bra, but aside from that the backing is SUPER cute!",87889,4
87889,I wear it with backless tanks and lower back tank tops and I feel like it accentuates my outfits without even trying.,87889,4
87889,It's pretty cheap as well compared to other stores selling bralettes at this time!,87889,4
87890,"true to size, shipped on time.",87890,4
87890,I don't think the sodalite colored ones look as good in real life as they do in the product picture but overall I think all three of them are worth the price.,87890,4
87891,"These compression shirts are nice, a little thin...not much, just a little, but they do what they are suppose to do.",87891,4
87892,I have scars on my legs I'm trying to hide.,87892,4
87892,"They are a bit thick, but not too much.",87892,4
87893,Color is accurate and product is represented well in the pictures and description.,87893,4
87893,The jacket does run kind of small though.,87893,4
87893,I ordered a medium(2xl) and it's a bit short.,87893,4
87893,"Not horrible, but I needed a size bigger.",87893,4
87893,"Anyway, the jacket well be great for fall/spring months.",87893,4
87893,"Something heavier for winter, but for a lightweight jacket this one is pretty good.",87893,4
87896,"The key's to follow the size chart in the product image section, but even then, there's still something a little off about the sizing.",87896,4
87896,"The bottoms fit me perfectly (typically I'm a Large but I measured myself and the chart said I was a XXXL), but the top's definitely a touch too big.",87896,4
87896,"That being said, I do like the top even so because it's got built-in padding (and NOT the kind that's just loose and stuffed into a haphazardly cut slot in the bra).",87896,4
87896,The ties for around the neck and the band make it easier to adjust and help compensate for the wonky sizing.,87896,4
87896,Print's nice but definitely looks better in the picture.,87896,4
87896,The fabric's pretty standard for swimsuits which was a bit of a surprise.,87896,4
87896,"I figured the material would be pretty thin, but it's not.",87896,4
87896,"This particular size and print for whatever reason was only $7, so I'm deliriously happy about this purchase.",87896,4
87897,a little tight and i have a belly so it covers some of it over my belly button.,87897,4
87897,But its beautiful and i cant wait to wear it,87897,4
87898,"Is beautiful, but I thouth was biger!!",87898,4
87899,Bottoms fit perfectly and top is slightly small.,87899,4
87900,I think the suit fits well.,87900,4
87900,"When i put it on, two of the buttons, on the vest, popped off though.",87900,4
87900,"I think for the price, I can live with sewing on a couple of buttons back on.",87900,4
87901,I wear a 38DD and the xxL fit just right.,87901,4
87901,"The only thing is it rides up, so I would use fashion tape to keep it in place.",87901,4
87902,"I am 5' 5"", 118 pounds and this fits quite nicely considering it's one size fits all, but it is a little big on me.",87902,4
87902,It's just what I need to wear over cocktail dresses in the winter.,87902,4
87902,I had to snip off a few loose yarns.,87902,4
87903,This was great for recovery after my csection.,87903,4
87903,"I only wore it a few hours a day for three weeks and it really helped support me, and helped my belly shrink.",87903,4
87904,These fit nicely a tiny bit snug at the waist and little short for my liking.,87904,4
87904,I am 5 10 and they fall just above the ankle.,87904,4
87904,The fabric feels a little scratchy.,87904,4
87905,Bought it so I could time myself in the pool.,87905,4
87905,Great job and large fonts so I can actually read it,87905,4
87907,"As other stated, the earrings were a bit tight and it took a little bit of time to get one of them in.",87907,4
87907,"That said, I absolutely love them!",87907,4
87908,"This is a very serviceable, classic Big shirt.",87908,4
87908,"An unusually soft cotton, it ironed up very well and looks good thrown over some leggings and a tee.",87908,4
87908,"Its lines are a little boxier than I'd ordinarily go for, but the length is good and the proportions of the shoulder against the length work just as well as I need it to.",87908,4
87908,"Easy-roll sleeve-- as I said, a very serviceable wardrobe item.",87908,4
87909,Would give them 5 stars if they weren't so expensive.,87909,4
87910,I love this necklace!,87910,4
87910,It is prettier in person than in the picture.,87910,4
87911,Fit great and looks just like the photo,87911,4
87912,"The shirts themself are actually kinda big, super comfy.",87912,4
87912,The built in bra is a little tight but its alright.,87912,4
87913,It is nice but the top really needs a little support.,87913,4
87914,These worked perfect for my 1-year old,87914,4
87915,"These socks are very good for me because I referee basketball, and I need the extra compressions to keep cramps away.",87915,4
87915,"Once I get them on, they work well.",87915,4
87915,"My biggest problem is that my hands are very arthritic, so, even with the help of knowing how to put them on, I have a very difficult time.",87915,4
87915,Getting them off is even harder.,87915,4
87916,The dress is beautiful but runs very small to size,87916,4
87918,I needed some lei's for my son's spirit day.,87918,4
87918,I like the style and the colors.,87918,4
87918,The only thing was that they shed a bit.,87918,4
87919,Somewhat small after shrinkage from washing; but Customer Service more than willing to replace them.,87919,4
87919,Still the most comfortable sock I've ever worn.,87919,4
87921,"The fit of this dress was great, beading is gorgeous, and overall it is a good quality dress.",87921,4
87921,"However, I didn't realize the whole top is see through except for two little sewn in cups.",87921,4
87921,I am a bit busty and they fell too far above my breasts.,87921,4
87921,So I had to go to a seamstress to get bigger cups put in and moved down.,87921,4
87921,But overall a great buy!,87921,4
87922,This shirt looks just like the picture and it is so cute.,87922,4
87922,I have gotten many compliments on it.,87922,4
87922,The only problem I have is that the sequins itch my skin a little bit.,87922,4
87922,"They aren't bad enough to make me not wear the shirt, but they can be annoying.",87922,4
87923,This dress is cute - it is longer than what is pictured.,87923,4
87923,"Actually, a lot longer - but they might all be different.",87923,4
87923,"I'm happy with the purchase, I bought it to go to the beach, and it will serve that purpose well.",87923,4
87923,"Not so sure if it will make it through the washing machine in one piece, but for the price, you almost know that you are buying a semi-disposable dress and I'm okay with that.",87923,4
87923,"Pleased with the way it looks on me, besides being a little longer than the picture, it looks the same on me as the picture.",87923,4
87924,"I love my fluffy, snowman pajamas!",87924,4
87924,In terms of comfort - it's great.,87924,4
87924,It's also quite warm (maybe too warm for places with lots of heat).,87924,4
87924,The only thing that I wish is for the legs to be wider.,87924,4
87924,"Upper part of the pajamas is nice and roomy, but the legs part is too narrow.",87924,4
87924,"And yes, my lower and upper proportions are perfectly balanced.",87924,4
87924,"Other than that, I've been very comfortable wearing my pajamas every day.",87924,4
87925,Don't be fooled It doesn't fight tight like the picture but I don't like my crop tops right anyway so I guess it worked out for me,87925,4
87926,I thought that it was as described.,87926,4
87926,"Low profil, and thin .",87926,4
87926,"Unfortunately, my husband wanted more of a money clip that also holds I.d.",87926,4
87926,Will give this one to our son.,87926,4
87926,Ordered one from Coach on Amazon today that is more like a money clip.,87926,4
87926,So I guess it is what you are looking for.,87926,4
87927,"Bought for my wife, who is 5'10"", and a 14-16.",87927,4
87927,"Snug, sleeves weren't long enough and would not fit over anything bulkier than a light sweater.",87927,4
87927,"Very nice looking jacket, just not right for her.",87927,4
87928,It's an okay sweatshirt but the arms are too short and it's made of a somewhat constricting fabric.,87928,4
87928,I really like the way cropped sweatshirts look but this one is just not great quality.,87928,4
87929,This is my third purchase of snoozies.,87929,4
87929,They are soft and washable and look good and fit well.,87929,4
87931,It's tough to know how to rate this.,87931,4
87931,It's a well made wallet but is also cheap-looking.,87931,4
87931,It's not a luxury wallet but also for $20 one shouldn't expect that.,87931,4
87931,I decided to stop using it after two weeks and switch to a more luxury product that I paid ~$50 for but that's my personal taste.,87931,4
87931,"You get what you pay for but as far as $20 wallets, this is a pretty good one.",87931,4
87932,"However, front side of bottom was not glued well and opened up after one month of use.",87932,4
87932,I have to use some shoe glue to re-glue it.,87932,4
87932,And it works fine after.,87932,4
87932,Do not feel difference compared to $100+ shoes.,87932,4
87933,"Overall nice but had to return, order a different size",87933,4
87935,"This was a little thinner than I'd hoped, but I will still keep it and wear it.",87935,4
87935,"I am a size 10 to 12 in the hips, and an 8 in the waist.",87935,4
87935,I ordered the large and it fits perfect.,87935,4
87938,Haven't tried this out yet but it's cute!,87938,4
87938,A bit thin but perfect for a quick beach or pool cover up.,87938,4
87940,I like it but not a fan of the material.,87940,4
87940,"Also, I'm a medium but I like my sweaters a little big on me so I got an XL .",87940,4
87940,"Sadly, It fit like a medium so if you want it big on you , you might want to get two sizes bigger or if you don't want it bigger I suggest you get at least one size bigger.",87940,4
87941,Only for small breasted women!,87941,4
87942,quite large but pretty will look nice with sweaters,87942,4
87943,Extremely soft and comfortable.,87943,4
87943,"Shrunk a bit in the wash, so I kind of wish I had ordered a size up for a looser fit.",87943,4
87944,"I'm 5'1"" and it fit perfectly.",87944,4
87945,"Honestly, I wasn't happy that prior order 'Girls Sneakers-Gray Joggers' was LOST in transit..esp, when its part of Birthday gift for my daughter.",87945,4
87945,"Furious, I blasted Amazon Cust Rep - they duly apologized plus offered me to pick ANY shoe (yes ANY) to make up for my girl's grief.",87945,4
87945,Daughter agreed on this 'Skechers Kids Swirly Girl' shoe - (although double price) and voila - Amazon ships it to me the NEXT day - at ZERO extra cost.,87945,4
87945,Shoe arrived only to sparkle a 70 mm smile on her face..wears it every day to school.. Nice comforting..Perfect fit size..,87945,4
87945,Colors are bright & pretty.,87945,4
87945,I'd recommend it... and why not after AMAZON's soothing way of apology...,87945,4
87946,"I typically buy large hats, but this one is just so slightly too big.",87946,4
87947,"Cute dress, wrong color for my daughter.",87947,4
87947,Would buy again in different color.,87947,4
87947,"Fit was good, beading was a little off center.",87947,4
87949,These fit VERY tight but that's what I wanted to keep my love handles in.,87949,4
87949,I don't have a tummy problem so I cannot speak for that but I do wish these went higher up.,87949,4
87949,The bottoms are flat an unlined making them invisible under tight clothes.,87949,4
87950,"Just about right--maybe a little tight, but not enough to return or exchange for next size up.",87950,4
87951,Beautiful dress pretty much fits as expected however it is a little loose in the top area not giving me as much  coverage as I would like,87951,4
87952,i love this bag the only thing wrong just a little to small for me,87952,4
87954,Very cute and lighter pink than pictured.,87954,4
87954,The only real problem was that the glasses are too large.,87954,4
87955,I purchased this top for a semi formal outfit with black palazzo pants.,87955,4
87955,"I found it to fit a bit small, but paired with shape wear it looked nice.",87955,4
87955,"The chest area is snug, and I am a smaller chested woman.",87955,4
87955,The sleeves are also a but tight.,87955,4
87955,The lace is very attractive but fragile.,87955,4
87955,I feel that with rough treatment it will snag or fray.,87955,4
87955,"For the right event, this is a nice top.",87955,4
87955,I would not buy it for everyday wear.,87955,4
87956,"It's not a brazilian cut swimsuit/bodysuit, but with the high cut it shows a good amount of booty...love it!",87956,4
87957,Very lightweight and comfy,87957,4
87958,My Grandson is a smaller 9 month old.,87958,4
87960,More of a thermal pant than a compression pant that I was wanted; but I like the design.,87960,4
87960,Maybe they'll be more comfortable for workout wear in the winter.,87960,4
87961,Was a gift - super cute.,87961,4
87963,The absolute only problem I have is with how high the waist is.,87963,4
87963,"Other than that, they're perfect.",87963,4
87963,I'll definitely order another pair in different style,87963,4
87964,"Good enough, but doesn't cover ur forehead!",87964,4
87965,"Feel Great, not good if you need underwire help, not going to be supportive for  women who are big busted,  Because of a health issue,my hand is paralyzed and now need to put my bra on over my head.",87965,4
87965,These are good for me!,87965,4
87966,hate sewing on buttons.,87966,4
87967,"The fit is good, I just wish it wasn't so wrinkled when I received it.",87967,4
87968,"comfy and fits well, doesn't get too big when it's wet.",87968,4
87968,the neck comes up a little too high for my taste but all around good quality.,87968,4
87969,I didn't realize the flowered version had a ruffle butt (which fits tight under a swim suit.,87969,4
87969,"I just thought the flowers were so pretty, but we wound up using the white more.",87969,4
87969,"Also, just FYI it fits pretty small.",87969,4
87969,My daughter is small for her age and turns 3 in 2 months and I felt the 3Y size just fit now and wouldn't fit by the time she was 3 1/2.,87969,4
87969,For anyone who hasn't used reusable swim diapers before-- these are great.,87969,4
87969,I've had 2 daughters go from infant to size 3 (as then they are potty trained) in this brand and they hold up and are so much better than the disposables.,87969,4
87970,"I thought it was a bit short in the front, but it does say irregular hem, and per my friends, I am a bit conservative in that regards.",87970,4
87970,It was very comfortable for a night out.,87970,4
87970,"After the second wearing, I purchased another one in a different color.",87970,4
87971,It's soft and a nice shirt.,87971,4
87971,I wouldn't say the pockets are much of a pocket at all.,87971,4
87971,Don't plan on putting anything in them.,87971,4
87971,Other then that I do like the shirt and it fits me as it does the model.,87971,4
87972,This is a great quality belt.,87972,4
87972,I've researched a lot of the available belts out there before settling on this one.,87972,4
87972,"Although a bit more expensive than some of the others, it had a lot of great reviews so I decided to give it a shot.",87972,4
87972,The belt is super soft and is easy to put on.,87972,4
87972,"It has a built in pocket and comes with an insert that can be heated in a microwave or frozen like an ice pack, great for those back muscle aches!",87972,4
87972,The brochure that came with it says you can turn the belt around after your baby is delivered and use the heat pack to soothe your belly muscles as you heal.,87972,4
87972,I'm a pre-pregnancy size 10-12 and ordered the L size.,87972,4
87972,It fits great so far.,87972,4
87972,I got it at about 23 weeks and so far at 29 weeks it still fits good.,87972,4
87972,My doctor recommended getting one to ease my pelvic pain and back pain.,87972,4
87972,"My back pain is practically non-existent when I wear the belt, however it doesn't help my pelvic pain at all which is why I took one star off the rating.",87972,4
87973,Loved the swim suit but it was too small.,87973,4
87973,Im normally a size M and ordered a Large due to other reviews and was still too small.,87973,4
87973,Had to exchange for a XL.,87973,4
87973,Im 5'0 and 140#,87973,4
87975,Fit as expected after reading reviews.,87975,4
87975,Cups don't have much lift but they are lined.,87975,4
87975,I'm not unhappy with this suit.,87975,4
87976,Looks more like coral instead of orange but i like it.,87976,4
87977,For some reason i expected this bralette to be made of soft lace fabric but it isn't.,87977,4
87977,It's a bit rougher than I expected but it isn't itchy or anything like that.,87977,4
87977,"The fit is a little small, I ordered an m/l and it fit more how you would imagine an s/m to fit.",87977,4
87977,However it's still a great buy for the price because it looks amazing once on.,87977,4
87978,I am pleased with this purchase!,87978,4
87978,After reading the reviews I ordered x-large (I am size 14) and expected them to be a tight fit since most people said they run small but they fit very well.,87978,4
87978,I think I could have gotten away with size large for a snug fit.,87978,4
87978,They are not the top notch quality but for the price point I think they are great!,87978,4
87979,A little on the heavy side.,87979,4
87980,The cost was a little more than similar slippers with shea butter and the effects of the lotion didn't last very long but the socks were comfortable and colorful.,87980,4
87981,Just as they appear in the picture.,87981,4
87981,They come with a sturdy case and a wipe cloth.,87981,4
87981,Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the lens seems a little thin and they need careful treatment when cleaning.,87981,4
87981,Other than that great for the price!,87981,4
87982,"I ordered #1 and I love it, however I thought it was white with the print.. Its light blue and the print is completely different.",87982,4
87982,I still love it though but was hoping for white!!,87982,4
87983,Really cute but marks up easily,87983,4
87985,"This dress seems well made, nice fabric and it was packaged nicely.",87985,4
87985,I would give it 5 stars except I think the decorative pockets should have been sewn down.,87985,4
87985,They kind of flop around.,87985,4
87985,I will probably buy this maker again.,87985,4
87986,convenient for on the go man.,87986,4
87986,nice quality garment at a fair price.,87986,4
87987,My daughter love the way it looks,87987,4
87988,The quality of the shirts are better then expected I use these for work and they are holding up fine.,87988,4
87990,Very elegant for carrying my business cards,87990,4
87991,The  chain was a little longer than I needed so I doubled it.,87991,4
87992,This product actually fits better than expected.,87992,4
87992,"My only complaint is that the sleeves are too short for me, so I find myself constantly tugging them down.",87992,4
87992,"Besides that though it's a good product for the price, you won't be disappointed.",87992,4
87993,"Am not too sure how long it is going to stay nice, but right now it looks good.",87993,4
87994,Fits good and shipped on time,87994,4
87995,"arrived on time, a little smaller then expected in the chest area but fits otherwise",87995,4
87996,little smaller than I thought.,87996,4
87997,"I bought this jacket in size M for my son, and it fits perfectly.",87997,4
87997,"Since we read the reviews before purchasing, we opted for the M instead of the S, as it sounded like it ran small.",87997,4
87997,We made the right decision.,87997,4
87997,"The jacket is stylish and comfortable, but the zipper is cheap.",87997,4
87997,"However, for the low price, the jackets seems to be well worth the money.",87997,4
87999,Not worth the wait.,87999,4
