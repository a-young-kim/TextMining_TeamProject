lors, but has to go in the garbageNot the same dress as picture.Look at the pictures.Because it's not the lor in the picture it's blue in the picture I got yellowish greenI ordered Green".if you not

it.the lor is not the same and doesnt look like wood at allNo I Donot like it because it is miss markedThey don't have the Kendra Stt branding on the side like all authentic ones do and the stones aren't even close to being maroon jade.Print is not what it looks like.My wife's finger turned green after only a few days.Note only does it run small, but my fringe wasn't attached in a uple spots.My sister and I wanted our children to look the same but she had orange feet and I had brown feet.Face was different.It is white and the lors are ugly.The print is blurry and almost unreadable, there's no white eyes" in the red circle that's supposed to be the mask.Also the logo is crookedDefinitely does NOT look like the pic.Completely different as shown in picture.Definitively doesn't look like the picture.Wish I would have got a lighter lor maybe.Not as cute as the one shown on the model at all.NOTHING like the picture, it's hot pink/black/green tribal print throughout, Just a triangle top and tie at the waist.This red lor bled VERY badly in its first wash and stained the rest of my laundry.I am trying to get the tint out of all my other clothes.It is light purple instead of grey and the letters bleed into the background.The sleeves are to short and not the same pattern as the picture.Was I wrong to think I would get all different lors as shown?The tiara" didn't have a red star on it and the skirt had been folded up so long that when you stretched it out, the blue peeled off and showed lines.Not to mention it's not even the same lor.It says it was army green and the shirt is Brown Doesn't even look like the pictures.Not like the photoThe lor mpletely faded and it broke in multiple spots..There are two small stains on my shirt and there is no space between the words

skirt and top and they sent the black one so I'm sending it back.Not what the picture is In the picture I see a beautiful shirt, but actualy It does not look like this.Not what the picture displayedThis item was purchased as a Christmas gift however I recieved the wrong lor.I've bought the dark blue and tan leaved set on another site before and my only mplaints is that the size is small.What sold me to buy the white and black set is the pockets on the pictures displayed.after having this for only two weeks the silver lor on it started to rub off and dis lorFaded and turned green after ONE DAYThe did like the lor and all gunmetal black that's why I bought it however as I stated its cheaply madeIt is very see through and the lor is much lighter than what is shown on Amazon.....disappointed......Once i got it it doesn't look like in the picture at all.Doesn't look like the pictureNot only were the stains more prominent but the lettering was not yellow as shown in the picture but whiteIf you plan on buying this shirt, GET IT IN A DIFFERENT COLORNot at all what the picture described.Color differ from site n customer service sucks The beige lor blends with the monofilament tops perfectly and you can tug fairly hard and your wig won't budge.Pattern is different than the picture.Not like pictured at all.Ugly shiny lor in personIt's really a greenish white.It's an extremely light lor,nowhere near the grassy green that shows in the picture.I got white leggings with a different print.The print to the shirt you can barely see I ordered black and gold and I received black with grey print Size is pretty small tooAlso white looks kind of dirty.The itam said the lor was white, and the photo looked white.It does not look anything like what is shownIf u purchase this jacket u would have to take it to get alterded.It came in the wrong lorI look at the model and think if she was photoshopped.Some was crooked and it turned my daughter's finger greenSee the purple in the picture?I ordered it in the light blue" actually a very pretty shade of green) and I was afraid it may be see-thru when wet.The lor does not look like the lor as shown in the pictures.I was going to by the purple one.It does not look like it does on the picture...I was really disappointed in this one because I ordered beige but it is more like a light yellow.This is nothing like the picture, it is a cheap iron-on decal, lors are faded and run together, the white outline is actually pink.kinda disappointed because the lor is brighter than the original.It was represented as having a small image on the front and the large image on the back, as shown in their photo.I ordered the burgundy and received and ugly red trying to be passed off as that lor.It is very cute and wish the size was appropriately labeled.To me it did not look like the picture.Unable to read print.Does not look like the picture at all.The image on the shirt looks different than received.I know the description said hot pink but these are like a neon fuschia.Doesn't ver anything the tan lor you see it's your body.From look to feel.The lor is way lighter than the one on the pic.. And the bottom half is too tight the size run a little small if you have cruves.Beautiful lor however the material and the dress itself did not look like the pic at all.I did not like it at all, it didn't look as in pic.Also, the bottom layer faded so the red doesn't match anymore.I tried to take a picture showing the lor change, but it's not easy to see the difference.Do not look like the pictureIt was wrong lor and too small, I didn't know,how to,return it because it had a label from China.Different lor than shown.I bought the solid red one and I'm really disappointed .The lor is off from the picture shown... it's more of a fire truck red, which I don't like... .lors not even in the same ballpark.Pants aren't same lor as the top and the pants do not look like the pants advertised.Unfortunately Hanes doesn't have purple tights just burgundy.THE COLOR IS PURPLE/MAGENTA, BUT VERY DRAB.Also, lors did not look like picture.Does not look like the pic.Got the inrrect dress; ordered black and got white.The red Stripes faded on the white.However I am unable to get out where the red dye faded the white.These are an odd white lor and obviously plastic.The dress is different from the pictures.Not as shown....just plain redDid not look like the picture.Didn't look like the image.Not at all what picture showedI thought I had inadvertently ordered girls capris-the solid white and solid black ones are that small.The lors look nothing like the pictures and it ran huge.The arm length was good, lor okay for being the wrong one, but was unmfortable and disappointing.The belt is very cheap looking and an awful orange-y brown lor.I does not appear to be the brown pictured.I've purchased them in msny lors and the others after one wash have tiny holes too so I didn't mplain but these came with holes.Does not stay up in the way the photo pictures it.Do not order this item, it does not look anything close to the image.Pictures do not represent actual product.Has a black spot on the left sleeve, same lor of paint as of shirt, very disappointed.Not as implied from picture.The pattern is mpletely off and I hate that it's not symmetrical.See the additional photo of a dish towel turned orange/yellow mpared to what it looked like before the washDid not look like photoI shoulda read small print.Color looked faded.The dress did not resemble the picture at allI bought the floral pattern, but the loration and design is slightly off of what's pictured.Its a shame it left a green ring around my neck.But they don't stay on in bed, and the black ones shed all over the carpet.The lored ear pieces are really hard to change out.Bag looks nothing like the picture shown, lor is not even bright like the picture, lor is like some dull dark red.The print and lor were mpletely differentInrrect lorThe shirt in the first picture is not what you get.I received the wrong lor dress, not even close to what I ordered.The lour is not the same as what's pictured.The shirt I got, the image is faded at the bottom because the printer ran our of the lour ink.Color is way off, the brown looks more like mustard style is not the same.The lor in the picture looks shades of grey but it is actually an off blue lor.They don't look anything like the picture.It is an ugly yellow lor.I got the dress and they are a red while the bottom of the dress is almost a purple.The lors are significantly different from the image picture and not what I wanted.Top bottom lors did not match poorly made.NOT THE SAME FROM PICTURELooks like pic.Does not look anything like the pic.The dress I received is not the dress in the picture advertisement.Too bad...the pattern is cute.Look at the pictures below.The top does not look anything like the picture.Also looks mpletely different than the picture.I mean it's about the same lor but those buttons?Turned brown in less than a day (did not get what i ordered looks different from the picture.It will turn a diffrent Color if wet I don't like it this shirt is nothing like what is pictured, lor is even different than in the picture,Not at all like pictured.Different style, different lor and runs small.The sweater I received does not look like what it is pictured.Photo looks ombre but they are just pink.TOO BAD after one time in the pool the lor came out.The green lor that I received didn't look anything like the picture.too small, red, not purple took over a monther to arrive all smashed in a flat envelope.And to make it even worse, the person who returned shrunk the blue setNext morning they were fully charged and we noticed the white on one shoe was a dim yellow.Doesn't look anything like the pic.Faded after first wear...dont waste your moneyThe socks was not what I expected they plain, dark purple and no writing on it.Not even the same as the pattern I ordered...its way too big and very little print.Print is unclear.Print isn't legible, doesn't even look like English.The stones are so tiny, the lor can't be seen.Description claims will not turn your skin green and it does.The only lor that even came close was the turquoise.The red turned out to be traffic-ne orange and the purple was not light purple but a dark, shiny purple.It doesn't look like on the picture.Does not look like the pictures, will not buy again.Sloppy print, very orange tint.Doesn't look the same as the pictured on Amazon and the details said sterling silver and it's not false advertisements.All is fake and false.THis top looks nothing like the pastel shades in the picture, very disappointed.Not at all what the picture looked like.Received today was disappointed not as cute as the pictures shows.Also the lor that came is the palest of mint, but is pictured as a Kelly green.To be fair, the lors of the dress do look like the picture. w looks like at least w.

nothing like the photoI got this because of how pretty the blue and bright the lors look and it's not even those lorsAlso I would not describe these as marled; you can barely see the lor variation.DO NOT BUY This skirt left its fuzz all over my legs turning them a purplish blackish lor.(Sorry, that's the closest lor I can mpare it to.)The royal blue is vibrant and pretty, but I had to pull this top down rather than it falling loosely as it should.The back also has black marks all over it and it's very flat, not rounded like it looks in the picture.This is the send one I bought and am so disappointed.They never look like they are presented online.The lor did not match and very large, I'd return but it's a hassleWay darker lenses than picture portrays.I ordered this and the pink in large and when I received them you uld see a Huge difference in the two shirts.The tag in this blue one was ripped out.Faded after one wash on ldNot just scuffs, but the lor mpletely goneDoesn't

does not look like the pictureI bought this as a gift and when it arrived the lors were very, very dull and I was very disappointed and ended up returning it.They do not look anything like the picture.As you can see in the picture is missing lor on some spots Neck and Arms joint)Not quite sure what happened I ordered a set of Opal and the purple ones but instead I just got one of each I

not look like the same item in the photo whatsoever.It's bright white, even though I ordered the lor in the default photo.The gold" is unnaturally yellow.Color is no where near the same as the picture.Didn't look anything like the picture it was a dirty grey black.APPEARANCE: The red looks slightly washed out.It's orange not brown, and it's not cute basically waste of money threw awayIt

the pictureThe red bleedsIt no longer looks like an American flag because it is red, pink and bluehowever mine doesnt glow.Also the hat does not look like pictureWayyy to big and the green is soo light its almost like a tan lor just a heads up...it does not look like the pictureCrappy print and wrong lor.Color disappointment.Send, these are much darker in person than in the picture.The dress is not a solid lor up top like the picture and well, that's false advertisement.I was disappointed with the lor of the dress and cut.Bad choice of of lour on shoes.Left it in a drawer and it turned a funky lor.The shirt I received is not like the image at all.And not much like the picture.It does not have the back image on it, and the front has a crooked, off lor, SIMPLY SOUTHERN logo printed on

this product Fake African print.I ordered three of these in different lors, and each were different blk.was sheer blue was thick and very rough This is NOT chiffon.The dots" on the veil are made from green pipe cleaners that are a different lor than the rest of the hat.It is not at all what the picture shows.Refer to the picture.It'seems not the dark grey you would hope for.Not AT ALL what the picture shows.Color not the same as pic grey) is a light grey opposed to what's shownI was super disappointed too, I bought several different lors and none fit.Does not look like advertised photos.Some of the yellow circles were missing and it wasn't white -First of all, the lor: NOT EVEN CLOSEThe one I received was like a dark GREENThis shirt is not real blue Jean nor is it oversized like the heading says.Looks nothing like the lor in the picture.Does not look like the dress advertised.It came tangled and black.It did not look like the picture.Wrong material, the lor isn't as pictured either.So the lor of this bag was very pretty I did like it a lot.It was not at all like the photo.Color pattern was different and only on exterior side, and it was not a sweater some man-made product.like the bracket.The lor I got is mpletely different from the lor advertised in the pics This is supposed to be identical to pink one I previously ordered.The graphics weren't centered and didn't even have the Hylete logo down the middle of the back as depicted.Color fades way to quickly were to bigIt's not at all like it appears in the picture.the one I was sent was also bone lored not as pictured at allWas not what the picture indicated.the logo looks like it was blown up and pixelated.Colors are different, pattern is different, I've never owned something so cheaply

represent what you will get in the mail.It is not like a pictureIt wasn't black.Received wrong skirt wanted skort)wrong size wrong lor entirely.Also, the lor does not match the picture.It is not anywhere close to being the golden yellow that is portrayed in the picture; its instead a very pale yellow.This does not look like the picture at all.Not what is in the picture....The lor of shows it to be a cream shirt and it's an ugly yellow.A blurry screen print.my daughter was upset she wanted it to look like the picture.the print is horrible.THIS OUTFIT SHIRT DID NOT MATCH THE PANTS IN COLOR ONE WAS LIGHTER THAN THE OTHER ONE WAS DISAPPOINTEDColor rose is not like the picture.It's darker and a more dull rose, not vibrant.Not mid calf is knee high, ugly and the lors are not as presented in the description and image.Also, the white looks like a nice, creamy white, but the outfit is like a pair of whitey tighties.Not even close to the same lorsVery disappointed, ordered red and it looked pink and my child put it on snapped the buttons and they came undone and fell off.First of all, the pic is misleading.. they had to use a little kids hand to display it.Not even the same lor.The lens are darker then the picturethis dress's lor is uglyThe black accents, I can't tell what it's made of, spread black stuff all over the shorts and won't me out.Color was ugly.Not what it looked like in pictureTHE PRINT IS NOT AT ALL THE SAME AS THE PICTURE.This isn't at all like the picture.The lor is mpletely off of one that wouldn't grow anything no matter how many times it was fed.It came greenDidn't look like what the description was on the sitenot the right lor, REEEEAAAAALLLLYYY thinThis shirt doesn't look anything like the picture.They had to send me a replacement because the lor was faded around the ller.The shirt I received is not the shirt in the picture.This dress didn't look anything like it did in the photos.It is a very glossy oily black lor and the writing inside is hard to readThe lor is also not true to the picture and it looks very cheap.Colors and pattern are pretty but the material kind of ruins it.Look else where if you want a Chambray shirt.Faded after first wear.The shirt I got was not like the picture advertized.What I got was a big black shirt with a small skull patterned and it was even wrong lor I spent another .- to try and get it to look like I expected.Not like the picture at all.The pattern was pretty, but I returned it.Way too much sequin for me...looked like something for someone older...like in their 's.The dress does not look like the photoOk, so...this swimsuit is cute.Bought the green pebble" one thinking it would be a nice evergreen lor like in one of the highlighted reviews...Nope I opened it and saw this muted brown-green lor that looks ugly.Design ruined by their cheesy logo stuck in an awkward spot.I was excited to receive my socks then I noticed the socks weren't the same lor as they are in the picture.The light green ends up making the socks look very weird.I ordered a different one and I hope this one will be whiteThey were beautiful, perfect weight, just right purple lor but way too small.FIRST AND FOREMOST THE SHIRT IS NOT BLACKI have purchased this to wear over a number of black outfits for a upming trip and sadly now I can't because it doesn't match.To start off I recieved the wrong case lor.The top and bottoms look like they will work but only for this year, if that.Looks pastel on screen, in person very very bright yellow.The lor is way darker than the pictures show.Too bad, because the print was really cute.They do not stay up and then look absolutely ugly.the lors don't look like the picture.Completely see through in whiteThis dress was supposed to be green.It was not the dress we order we get a gray dress nothing like the pictureI got the orange and blue ones which isn't a big deal but I was really looking forward to the ones shown.The pattern is very cute.pretty print, but way too long.Color bleedsThe lors are a joke mpared to the pictureThe lor is cute and is as pictured but it's oversized for me.They didn't have even a slight bit of a blue lor to them.Disappointed, does not look like picThe turquoise" did not look even anything like a real one.it's supposed to be more tan when it actually came in a ugly dark brown.It didn't look purple.It looked blue.From the picture it looks like navy, but sadly it is more a royal blue.White skirt was a dingy white, did not match my tops with white white trim.Not at all what it looks like in the pictureIt's too bad, too, because I loved the lor.Print is very cute.The real one that the model is wearing is actually grey and from urban outfitters.It turned my finger greenish black within a uple of weeks.I used to buy another brand but I thought why not to try this one and now I regret it.The blue top part and black stripes look funny together.lor was not a light mint lor as ordered, it was certainly dull and darker than shown.We received ugly orange and blue trainers.Print is blurry.They look the same as in the picture shown.This time however, the stone is NOT sea blue it's a dark lifeless blue and the chain is extremely cheap looking.Almost black looking.Not as pictured or not as pictured on me StrangeIt appeared to be red, but it was orange....The pants stripes look orange instead of red.It faded immediately.The pants, however, do not even match the shirt.Not like the picture shown at all.Sizes are Asian sizes...read small print info..Beautiful skirts but can't wear..Was not the lor I expected at all was a dull red instead of a burgundy but have to suck it up to late to look for another.Note the red tag was before.What really disappointed me though was the lor.However it has white highlights all over the embroidered pattern.Dose not look like the pictureThe picture of lilo and stitch was very pixilated buy not horrible and the center of stitches eyes which should be white are pink like the back ground picture.It is a very plain version of the picture.The nighty does not look like the picture...the lors are two different lors that do not match and the sizing chart is way off.I ordered the blue reindeer.BUT THE CROTCH IS A DIFFERNT COLORIt's strange that the seller bothered to specify that the ring will not turn your finger green.The lor is not as vibrant as in the pictures although still a pretty lor.I ordered this top thinking it was the pretty baby blue lor that shows in the picture and it actually arrived in a fairly ugly" green lor.If you are expecting it to look like rose petals as I was, you may be disappointed...it looks more like large drops of blood or chunks of blood).Also, there was a black dot on the front that didn't me off ink?)When I washed it the red bleed onto the gray.The top was more of a smoker stained yellow lor.When I put this on it did not look like the photo.Was disappointed because the lors are NOT AT ALL like the ones pictured ( every pair is pretty much transparent except the white and black...I already had light/transparent ones and was hoping these would be more bold, like pictured (I got the black and white because they look so cute in photos.wallet lour keep rubbing off in pocketSee picture below.lor of the gold is very cheap looking.The leopard print was not brown but an unattractive olive green.Additionally, the dark grey" I ordered and is shown in the description doesn't match what was sent; mine is just a tad darker than a light grey.If it were lighter than brown, I would probably have to wear something under it.They looked cute when I put them on but within a uple hours, my fingers were mpletely green and the lor started to me off.Doesn't look like the picture at all, was disappointed.The lor faded in spots when washed.The lors are darker in person and it smelled absolutely AWFUL.(silver in lor and made to look" like metal).Disappointed as I love the lour.It is pretty but doesn't look real.Faded after one washFirst, I guess I probably should have read the description closer, but you don't get all of the lors shown here.I did like the light pink lor, but overall, the lors were a huge disappointment.did not look like picture.However, the biggest downfall to this item is that the lor eventually faded and now instead of purple, it's just clear.Too big, the pink is a lot paler than the lor shown.I like lorful Hawaiian shirts but this one does not look Hawaiian at all.Then I washed it ONCE and the lor on the print flacked off.Does not look like picture to me.Cute for a picture or two, but don't expect it to last any longer than that I got one use out of it and it was toast.Is there any way to send it back and get one like the one displayed?My big problem with it are the pictures.This bag is not blue as pictured, it's basically black unless it's under direct bright light, and even then it's very dark blue, unlike the picture.Only to end up with green/blue ear lobes and sore ones to boot.nd thing the print is faded.It was supposed to have the logo in the background and all that's there is a circle.The pink looks yellowish It do not look as pretty as the picture.They look like they have a much lower profile in the photo.Lastly, the brown ones have a spotted leopard" pattern on them that no man should be caught wearing.The blue is pretty though.Thought they would be black like in the picture, but they were actually light brown so I had to paint them.The logo and lettering is however a single iron-on type transfer.However, there is a reason the models in the pictures of all lors hide the waist.The lors are dull unlike the one on the listing.The lor of the green necklace is nowhere near the same in person, more like a bright blue green.They do not look like the picture that represents the product.I got the red and there is no way I uld have worn it without a visible slip underneath.The bikini came very wrinkled and the only reason I chose to return it was because it doesn't look like the shade in the picture.I returned it and reordered thinking maybe someone picked the wrong lor by mistake but it came in dark teal again.Picture to show lor difference.I've had pair of these, different lors.The send stone I used it my fingers actually started to turn greenIn the picture it looks more like it is black stripes but in person it is definatly blue.When i had purchase it it was a diferent at and received a different oneIt's a weird beige-yellow.losing the gold after wearsThe case has some black marks on it.Do far it has only happened with the dark blue ones.Did not receive this product receive a oval pair not circle picture is misleading.The photograph does not actually depict the lor properlyThe band has more of a yellow look than a gold look.the lor is so pale you can't tell what it is:-( Otherwise, it was cute but I uldn't wear it.It didn't look anything like the picture.This dress is nice but doesn't look like the picture.I ordered eggplant and received this awful bright purple Barney vest.Not at all like picture.Which is a shame, because they are beautiful dressesThought it was heather red gray but instead it turns out being just light graythe owl on my shirt came in a different lor, instead of brown it is yellow.Am returning it and will look for something else to get.I asked for the light pink but instead I got a hot pink onedesign on shirt doesn't look AT ALL like the picture.I received a different shirt than pictured.Pattern does not look like the picture.Tinier than even they appear in the picture.The dress is cute however the red dye has stained by sweater.The front of the frame is half black.All scratched up on my first tripAnd the lor is nowhere near as purple as the picture shows it to be.It's not ok that this isn't even fake turquoise.There is a splotchy disloration on the front in the chest area, and a small blue smear near one of the upper buttons.The lor nothing to be with the picbad experience cheap clothes lor faidIt's says khaki however it is more yellow than the picture shows.Wrong lorI returned it and wanted to get the same black one with brown handles, and they don't even have it available anymore.Disappointing it was purple and blue.I ended up reversing one side so my left piece was inside out, and white.It did not look like what's in your display.THIS WAS PICTURED AND IS SUPOSE TO BE BLACK N SILVER....WELL, MINE CAME AND HAD CHEAP LOOKING GREEN CRYSTAL THINGS IN ITI WANTED AND ORDERED SILVER N BLACK Too long, too yellow, too some thingthe dress was not as expected, we were very disapointedI ordered the light blue and the bottoms were see through.. size up and pick a darker lor maybe?The darker lored outfits don't have this problemNot as vibrant,..wish it had more lour was a bit disappointed Cheap and was a different lor.Not at all what it looks like in picture.I purchased , Coffee Ripped, and , Black and grey striped.wrong lor..Very pretty print but it is just too small got X but is more a large or medium.didn't look anything like the picture.The lor was a dull burgundy and didn't look anything like the picture.However, the yellow was so see-through that I uld not wear it and am sending it back.I like the lor and that they aren't fold over but the for was all wrong.They're clearly black and silver in the picture but i received them yesterday(on time but they were black and gold.The beads were not red as the picture, pale more like reddish pink, did not appreciate the distorted lorThe silver was only glued on sequins and the blue showed through a LOT.The picture makes it look like the top is mpletely silver, or white underneath.Additionally, the lor of the actual shirt is VERY different.On the upside, it's very pretty just like the picture.This says dark red but its not.It's too short and the lor just looks dirty in person.Ordered the blue in purse that looked like rnflower blue.The picture looks like there is blue in it.Just did not like the way it look on me, the white against the black was not really flattening, it look CheapDoes not look like the photo at all.x it looks likeWhen I got my set of , the rose plugs were actually white and I only received one of them instead of like you are suppose to, so good thing I was buying them for the purple and black onesLike the other reviews not all the stone are real blue mostly grayIt is darker than pictured, but description warned me of that.I was super disapointed because almost all of them were repeats and the art was kinda sloppy.It is way darker than expected, except where it is faded.It looked like a blue garbage bag on me.Loved lor byt to mplicated to put on.a bit dissapointment because I thought the saying beer, lime sunshine" was in black lored font.But I don't like that the words are just a stick on decal that can be peeled off.Started to change lors, look more lite pink only worn it a few times.The white part isn't white and not pretty in person.Orange like an orange.Got them before delivering date but they don't look like the pic I guess ok for priceThe lor is much darker than I expected, though that isn't a big issue.not at ALL like the picture.The sleeves are way to short, it is not the same as the pictureHowever, I got a black and a navy.At least in white lor.Dull lors as opposed to the photo provided.It is a different shirt.The bracelet's red lor rubs off on my skin.In the picture.The lor is not the same as pictured.pretty lor thoughMy lor pants is pink, maybe the black one work better, I will try one in black.On the small side and the lor is much darker than shown.Other than that it is like the description and is how it looks in the pictures.Returning and looking for another brand.It says it is red but it is quite hot pink.It does not look like in the picture at all.The lor is different.Color was not as bright and popping as on the web; it was more of a dull purple.Plaid&Plain came through for me.Colors faded significantly after a single wash.The two stars are because it looks just like the picture.This didn't look at all like the picture.The lor is a really dark purple.This wig came in the wrong lor unlike shown in the pictures.Does not look like the picture, dissapointedColor is a lot lighter than pictured and the straps are pretty thin.I know for a fact they're only going to last a few wears before the lor fades and the buckles break.However, you get what you pay for and they were cheap and they are the right lour brown.Also, the lor is off.The leaves that look brown are actually a bright orange/red.Unfortunately the lor was a bit off and I uldn't get over it and never wore it.Looks gray when looking thru them.It does not look like the photoI ordered red, its maroon.i got the red bag but the lor is more faded than the photo online.I ordered white very thin.Maybe it was mismarked.The blue depicted in the photograph is a lighter pastel, the actual thing looks like a more neon baby blue.Super bright yellow, not subtle like the photo.Maybe it it was a plain lor swimwear it wouldnt be so bag but the lor looks washed out and uglyThese were advertised as Baby BOY socks, and they are... sorta, in lor.The pink part is very much see through.Additionally the logo in the front and center really ruined it for me.It does not look like silver, but a really cheap light silver lor, hard to describe, just imagine what stume jewlery looks like.It was not the same lor as the picture shows and the pattern was messed up on the butt cheek making it look wet.The lor was as pictured-just WAY to small for me to wear.The lor was highlighter yellow as opposed to the yellow in the picture.They don't look like the picture.Really cute but it turned my skin greenFaded and the tiger is way too yellow.Advice...if you are a or more, don't order.It was supposed to be for Christmas family pics, where everyone wore red.Not really clear, more of a hazy white.This shirt is somewhat large the lor wasn't what I expected, kind lighter than what it seems in the picture I'm kind disappointedThe large in black and white was too tight and the XL in the black and white had such insanely long straps I figured it must have been a deformed cut.I still haven't figured out how to make it look like the photograph, and if I can't get a friend to figure it out, then I will likely be returning it.Was really disappointed when i saw if was not the right lor.Letters faded fast and I didn't even wear it out too much.They seemed rose or light pink online but are definitely bubblegum pink and look/ feel like knock offs.It's darker than the image posted.Ordered different lours grey and light grey and ended up with of the same lour.doesn't look like picture.The lor is beautiful, but the material is horrible.It is cute overall at first when taking it out of the packaging.it leaves big red stain on your skin todress is short like in the picture but loring is right onThese are a nice shoe but the lour is wrong.Really purple and not as shown in the pictureits not even the lor i expected it be.i pick light blue and got dark .The picture lor is dull and cartoonish.The bows keep falling of but the print is cuteI ordered the dark blue/navy one and when I opened the package, it was purple, which it was the wrong lorAlso-lor wasn't even close...Such a shame for something so brilliantly lored and well.tailored.The shirt I received was very different from the one pictured.Not as firm" as it appears in the photos.Spend a bit more and get a another brand.the lor off and the dress is very unattractive.horrible lor, the dress looked like it was worn and washed times.Disapointing... its really little in mparison of what it looked like in the picture.. and also the swarovski heart lor is diferent....Sendly lor is mpletely different from the one shown in the picture.Read the print you only get one bandColors are not as vibrant as expected looks terrible on.too long, and look different with pictureThe lor of the wine purse on my mputer was an obvious purple, but when I received it, it was a disgusting red lor.I returned it right away as the lor was so bad and not what I thought it was advertised as.Did not even look as picture.Its a pretty dress but after you wash it the lor fades.It fits OK but you can mpletely see my bra through it even oh you can't tell in the photo and it was supposed to be a deeper red but it almost looks pinkSuper dark means pitch black.The lor was exactly what I expected....overall the outfit itself looked really cheapIt fit fine but the yellow was very see through and the embroidery was fraying Too small and white lor was too revealing...returned.I just painted my face instead.Does not look anything like the pictureAnd the print has the word Paris in it, but it is printed backwards.Also, you can see the outline of the padding through the cups when it is reversed to the pink side while you're wearing it.Cute jumper but doesn't resemble the photo.The lors are much brighter than they appear here, losing the boho"-trending look.When I got my plugs they were mpletely different in lor and size, I'm very displeased.I love the lor and how the material feels but, its way too bigBut the logo must have been printed at low resolution because up close, it's kind of blurry and the red is multiple shades, but at a distance of about feet, you can't tell.Tee shirt much darker than in image shown.The lor is vibrant and wallet has the amount of mpartments that I need but it has a horrible fish smell that will not go awayUpon closers reading, it's labeled as a pull over.They send me the wrong size and wrong lor ( very dissapointed.Maybe should have stuck with the navy ones.I mean Irish Green.And it also doesn't look like the pic.It is an adorable swimsuit although I didn't like the lor.It is not a bright yellow like the picture shows.I love the lor but over all very disappointed with the product and packagingThe design is pretty, so I am bummed that they turn my toe green.The hem around the edge looks sloppy and uneven and the lor is MUCH lighter than the picture more of a sky blue than a French blue.Just imagine the picture without eyes.The lor was listed as red, when it came in, it was more orange than red.it's not like the pictureWeird lor.Now i have to find some way to remove red lor from her other clothes.the lor was off and it they looked very cheap--like dollar store sunglasses.The hood and stitches are all brown, as depicted.The lor is as pictured, sleeves are so cuteAlso, the fabric and lor is mpletely different than the size medium.I will post pics to show the difference.The shirt did not fit and it was the wrong lor.VERY difficult to click togetherThe metal ended up oxidizing with my finger and it turned green and black.It's not actually white as advertised.Beautiful lors and material is nice but way too small.i requested the purple one shown, but was sent another purple pattern that was not cute.I though the lettering would be pink, but it was white (First off, the material is very strange and the white dress is not a white but is more of a dingy yellow white.While the pattern is similar to what is pictured, it is definitely not the same shirt.see through in the white.the lor does not match the image looks like a cheap shirt.they run big, but I know that and order smaller.. these however- faded and wore out the lor after the first, maybe send wash. that's a shame, because they were cute out of the package.The lors are not what is pictured, the one I got had black instead of brown and koto nearly as much grey, the sleeves are really long and wide at the wrist.The white daisies also became dislored blue).I like how the product looked on advertise Picture.It does not look like the photo with the model in it.I ordered the pink dress and got the red.Love the lor and style and am disappointed that it didn't work for me.Really dark yellow fake lookingColor is nothing like the picture pale greenI liked the shirt I got but it was not the shirt pictured.Unfortunately, I didn't read the small print which stated that it was PU Leather," a term that didn't mean anything to me until I looked it up and found that it was a man made product NOT leather.The lor blue looks very different from the picture.Does not look like what's in the picture.Like the lors but to bigThe scarf is pretty enough, I ordered the pink and blue expecting there to be blue in the scarf, like in the picture.:( It also isn't a sweater, like the picture indicates, but a / sleeve shirt.Too bad as I really like the lors, pattern, and overall quality.Bought the red, but it was closer to Orange.And what I mean by not full picture is that it doesn't even show his hands....DO NOT GET WHITEIf you want it to look like it does on the model, don't bother.This bag is ok, but it is not pink and black.Not even like picture.Looks like piclor wasn't even close.The lor is not as pictured.Color was grt but to smallOrdered green and they are too small.Does not look like the pictureIt Looked like tton and true red, however it was not as it seemed.the lor faded at the first washed.Actual lor is much darker.I ordered the light blue version and was disappointed at how far from a"light" mputerHeadband and tutu were way different know lor.I was very disappointed in the lour.The lour is far ftom what was in the picture.I want dark brown instead i got a lighter brown bagIt is a pretty burnished brown lor, and has a nice looking buckle but the product description is misleading.Didn't even try them on because the lor was so off/different from the picture that I am going to try to give them away.Does not look like pictureHowever, the mirror is cloudy and smeared.I'm so upset with this orderThe lor is significantly lighter than the picture it's not a bad lor but doesn't really match what I'd intended it for).I was expecting the black and white design in the image I guess I thought the black might actually be blue, explaining the name.Also, they do NOT look like the darker brown in the picture.Color and sizeThe blouse I received is a tacky lor and is too large.However, it was all pink except for a tiny line of blue at the edge.In the picture it appears to have fins with it but it does not.It is COMPLETELY see through and does not look like the pictures at all.in the description this shawl is supposed to be navy blue.It is cute and I do like it, however it was wrapped against a white little sleeve and it was turning green.Color is the same as posted but have a very short torso and shirt made that more prominent, also does not wear the same on the shoulders as expected.White fades very quicklyDisappointing, they were super cute for the minutes I got to wear themCute cut but the lor is really ugly in my opinion).The offwhite/beige looking lace at the top is actually bright white and the shirt is more of a really bad light blue.I feel like it looks stumey- still the cut IS kinda cute if it were just different lors I even debated trying to dye it) but decided I'm too lazy and I just can't get over the lors.This is a cute shirt, but what I received doesn't look much like the picture.It's really thight and the logo is not even one word is not even with the other one even twist I won't even up..The lor wasn't bright but dull.Send, the lettering is WAY OFF it is as though the CAMP and the AGNE and the CAMP and the AIGN are all separate words.For some reason all three shirts for differently.The lining is a nude lor, which doesn't show in the pic, but does show under the white part.It's much more solid, much smaller than the photo and the lors is not as the pictured.Pretty lors but snagged in wash first time.Doesn't look like picDidn't me out like the pictureOverall, not nearly as cute and slightly more brown than the photo.both were predominantly chinese characters, paired unhelpfully with a smattering of english.I was surprised to find a rather pink section in the sleeves, whereas in the photo it appears to be a very pale pink, so that you may not see that pink is in the sleeves.An odd lor mbination once I tried it on.The hoodie I received was faded.Beyond this, the lor in person seems different than pictured, too.The White Jade" appears nothing like the picture at all.There is no pink tone to my set whatsoever, it seems like they just gave me a pair of white plugs instead.Firstly, it is nowhere near the neon pink lour in the photo big no no for me sendly although somewhat big on me I had to tug at the sleeve to make it actually an off the shoulder look.I guess it does look like the picture.non were like the picture.Hated the lors.Guess it was supposed to look like antique red, white and blue.Did not look like antiqued, rather it had green tint to it.I was disappointed by this dress, its so pretty in the image.The picture lets you assume that they are silver like the clasp.Came crushed and the lor is pale.Very light and wrong lor for Silver.The print is very pretty, despite all of that.the lining lor was odd, not very natural looking.Small lor not even close to picture and has cutouts on shoulders that you can't see in picturesNow, not-polarized is one thing.It's sort of an orangey brown rust lor.It fits well but the lors faded drastically on the first wash.The lors are very nice, but it doesn't go with my skin tone make it look pale) and also the bottom part has an opening that might get you in troubles if you don't realize it.It also turned my finger green.Also, one of the black pair was ripped.Smaller tan photo,The blouse is a pretty design and the lor is also.Started to turn black after the first wearPicture shows darker ffee lor towards bottom but actual dress is all one lor.Definitely a dull green lor.Most of the ones I got were weird patterns and very similar in lor.It's a really cute bracelet but it turns my wrist blackI ordered a green skater dress and a black one in the same size and both tags told said they were a medium large but the black one is tight.Well, the picture looked purple with a black strap; the description says royal blue".It's not as cute as it appears to be in the picture and the llar is weird.It doesn't look the same as the picture.And the beige lor looks grey in the picture, I thought I was ordering a grey bag, my fault I didn't read the lor when ordering.My only issue is that the lor I thought I was getting is actualy a very different lorfrom above.More like fushia vs a plum, or purpleThe red on the shirt was a mpleatly different shade of red it was way more dark and more like a brown-red rather then red and the logo COMPLEATLY peeled off little by little over a few weeks.It just isn't a cute lor, especially for workout pants.They don't look at all like the picture.It blinks different lors and doesnt match the rest of the shoe.The lor I ordered was ffee, but the belt I received was tan even the tag said tan).lors look fadedIts stains..a lot.Shirt in picture was not shirt sent to me.And the white" looks more like a light grey.It isn't red white and blue like it looks in pic.The lor was not mentioned in the ad, the picture looked blue, shirt is black.DOES NOT HAVE THE DRAPE IN IT AS THE PIC SHOWS.Logo was a little faded.Loved the lors and image, but after washing only twice the image is already peeling.These shoes are almost a pale yellow.didn't look like the dress in the pictureToo bad, as the print was cute.Color was diff it's open on top.The lor of the ears isn't even remotely as pictured for the orange and beige."They look terrible and do not work at all for my kitsune splay because of the tacky lor.If it had a different band this watch would get Stars...Looks better in picture, lor is not the same, the sleeves are too tightAlso, I purchase this in light red which looks orange on the monitor, but is more like ral red in person.I would not get the light grey lor, which I know is my mistake but it's just very plain.doesn't look like the picture.The point in the front is misaligned, so it looks funny on.strange lorThe lor is mpletely different than the picture.But the lor fades real quick.I wore it x by the third use the lor started to fade and the paint started to chip and looked blackIt is annoying that I got pink, blue, Orange, green and greenish- blue.The dress does not look like the picture.The hat I received is a cranberry red and not the fire engine red shown in the picture.Very disappointing as I adored the style and lor.So not what the picture look like.Shirt does NOT look like the picture.I have the blue one in a medium, the pink one is a large.The arms are very small and the red is much brighter than expected.On my actual sweatshirt she's a hardly noticeable outline of white.The lor I got was not navy but a weird medium dusty blue, which, when mbined with the cut and shape of the shirt also not quite like the photo) looked just like I was wearing belted medical scrubs.Colors faded really bad from first wash.The only issue I have is I ordered grey and I got a grayish hunter green lor although I didn't really mind.Pink is also NOT PINK.I ordered the lor kahki" but what arrived was a pinky-flesh lor is very unattractive.the lors are not what they look like in the advertisement photos, they are darker.Cute bodysuit but it's not the lor that is advertised.Looks more green in the pic then actually wasThe pattern is cute but the stitch is white instead of a darker lor, looks cheap IMO.It's a shame because the lors and pattern were so pretty.Different lors in the crochet make it look faded.Doesn't really look like the photo stars for symbolism but no more for the poor design and wearabilityThe lor is much darker than the picture.It is brown, but the picture shows orange tone.The band turned her leg purple from lack of oxygen.This dress came as a dark blue.The entire back is shear blue with a white star pattern and is actually super pretty.And did not look at all like the photo.I ordered but didn't get the product pictured.Turns pinkish orange on white sheets, nothing like what's pictured.Also the design was sort of cartoon-y, didn't really resemble the photograph.However, the lor was not red like it was listed.I received my order,took a little long but after all that it was wrong lorIt was somewhat cute, which is why I'll give it stars, but the ribbon was a mpletely different lor than it shows in the picture and quality was poor.not pictured as shown.It looks more like the one in the send pictureColor is mpletely different in person.The picture on here is very misleading because it shows a sweatshirt and the item we got was some weird silky shirt.the gold lor was dull on a few beads and there were damaged beads out of in package as pictured.The Purple of the W logo is faded and looks nothing like the photo.On the white stripes you can see through it pretty evidently.Ours ended in just blue short legs.I'm no model, but this doesn't look anything like the picture.I ordered this cardigan and received a little bit different lored one than the one I ordered.COLOR was extremely inaccurate.The American flag ink was smudged so you can't really make it out.Beautiful dress and would have really loved it, it the right lor but it came damaged, so I have to return it.does not look like the image lor is different, no tie on pants in front like the image hat has a split tie in the backWhen they arrived he was initially unhappy with the lor, as they appear far more yellow than khaki.The golden watch started turning silver lor in less than a month, so now it looks old because it's so faded.wrong size sent, lors are somewhat different than the photo not as clear, bright).The lor looks more of an army green in the picture but is actually brown.These were advertised as red and labeled as such in their package.SUPER DARK AS ADVERTISED* NOT SUPER DARK I WASTED MY MONEY It looked like the thread was a different lor possibly.The purple isn't purple - I would call it dusty rose, which is how it appeared on my mputer screen.A previous poster made a note that the dress is not white, but actually has a yellow tint.They are rrect, the top looks like someone peed on it; the lor is not attractive.But the Snow White does not look like the picture.Runs small and the lor is actually melon/salmon, not red as described.The lor is the same, but is not something you can use to go out, that is my pijamas cabinetLooks just like picture.why does the shirt have yourself and urself on it?It didn't look like the picture at allGood quality, however, i received the wrong lor ordered navy blue and received a royal blue).if you are wanting what the picture shows, look elsewhere.I knew they were replicas but they gave me the wrong lor.They were not as dark as in the picture and looked like obvious tightsThe patterns were nothing like what I had ordered and my kids won't wear them..if you see the picture the cuff-links don't have a black background which do me in the ones i received.Looks like it would a very light lor almost a yellowish, it is notNot as described, we got orange lors instead of the cute red and black mickey.Color is not as pictured.Color looks very faded almost like gray It doesn't look as it is n the pictureThis is not a leopard printt.The logo on them wears off easily.Its like spray painted it seems, the lor mes off at nearly nothing touching it.I do have a problem though with the words being so faint, not at all bright like in photo.Does NOT look like photoI was ordering this specifically for the lor, so I am disappointed.Loved it when I first got it, but after wearing it for one day, it began to turn green.Beginning to change lor.I wanted the exact legging pictured, and what I got was a mpletely different pattern, diagonal stripes and stars on both legs.Runs VERY small ........ Color is off.It does not look like the model...Very pretty but wear it for a week and it turn my finger blackThe black symbol looks sharp in this picture but buyer beware, the hat is a cheap, light black print.I may have to buy another in a different lor.....yes to wear as a shirt.Other lors seem to vary in price from up to .The lor I received did not look at all like what was pictured online.I don't wear yellow.My biggest problem with them is the blue tint you see when looking through them, all warm lors are extremely muted.It was really distracting to the look to have that band of gray visible, so I ended up wearing this underneath a different dress.LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE.The arms don't look like the girl in the photo on me.dingy white.Cons- Not even close to the aquamarine lor shown, but more of a muddy blue hue.The lor of this shirt is pretty, but there are silver rings on the sleeves that I did not notice in the picture.However, the lor isn't even close to what is depicted.I ordered the pink/grey/white shirt but, what arrived looked different from what is pictured.It is very thin and the lors are not what is shown on the website.It mes across as more orange/yellow than pink.The stripes do not match up on one side of the bottom border, so it looks kind of crooked.This shirt doesn't look like the picture.But the shirt doesn't look anything like the pictureMy dress came in white and black not cream and black as pictured.I will say the lor was spot on.Color faded after first wash.This dress does not look anything like the photo.Also, the top is not a dark purple like it shows in the photo; it's more of a wine/burgundy lor.The lor was also darker than it appeared in the display photo.The shirt looked silver in the pic but it's like a cream lor lace on the white shirt.It doesn't look like what is pictured.The pattern doesn't look the same as the photo.By the third time my daughter wore this, the original lor was no longer evident.It is lime green and UGLY.When they came, they were all pink.None of the blue/green/pink as pictured.I reordered packages and when they came, they were all pink also.Is there anyway to get the blue packages as shown?I hated the pink lor.It also show this top in white and it was off white at best.Also, the lor was nowhere near the dark navy in the photo; it was more of a bright blue with a plastic sheen.Just like the picNothing mpare to the look on the picture.I got the red one and after the first wash it bled into the white lace at the top, so the shirt is now red and pink.Not at all like picturedFaded turned black in two days The hands are pretty difficult to distinguish from the background.It is black.Not as long as the picture either.Love the pattern but didn't realize how much smaller these would be than the solid black, navy and blue.Look more like a light blue than grey.Overpriced for what you get.The lor is mpletely different than pictured.Very pronounced chemical odor.Liked the lors and patterns on it, but runs very small and the cups are to large also the metal under wire on the cups was popping on the left side one..doesn't look like the picture, didn't like it.no stretch to the top and the lors are off its almost cute... almost.Love the print, but the sizing is all wrong.Finally, the product doesn't match the picture.This bag is off white.Disappointing, because the stye and lor was cute.These had big black spots.Then I got this XL with the dull lors.I was pretty dissapointed when I got these leggings in the mail.I liked the pattern and lors, disliked the fit and style of shirt mainly because I thought it would fit differently based on the pictures and the description.The nd wig is closer in lor to the picture.Bought the same shirt in two different lours.Don't waste your money on this one...the lors look nothing whatsoever like the pictureI can even see what lor they are underneath just by looking in the mirror.I got the navy blue polka dot bottoms with the red top....you can see through the butt.They are not just circles like the picture portrays.Color loos nothing like whats advertised and it fits terrible lools terrible worst i ntacted the seller and i was mpensated..Not the greatest quality; ordered white and received greyThe lors and pattern don't look nearly as nice in person as they do on the model.Color is not rrect: very yellow, but looked beige in the description.A bit different than picture.It is very very thin, and that raised a red flag for me immediately.I ordered this hoodie in Burgundy but it arrived in black.Not too bad but received the wrong lors.The dress is a MAJOR difference from what the picture shows and what you get.Does not look like the picture...the pic looks like it's a a variety of pastels- when in reality, it's bright, harsh lors.The yellow is almost fluorescent.Picture was misleading at the time, although now that I'm back out here, they've changed it.Nothing like the picture... more like a black and blue heather, and very cheap.It is too big than I expect.it is red not yellow like the picture.when I received, it was not ok missing one stone.Comfortable, but too big and the lors are much duller than pictured.It's a very yellow, very fake looking, gold.Would be cute if the bow was as it looks in the picture and was RED white and blue.The sunglasses were lightweight and the lor was nice but I got the feeling these were fake.Colors all wrong ..The neon yellow is actually neon green.Very unflattering silhouette.The version I received of this shirt has the print reversed with the flowers on the bottom and the stems on top.It's a pretty print, butsatin doesn't excite me.It is also almost a brick" red, not as bright as the picture indicates.Didn't look like the pictureTurned black almost immediately and caused the other bracelets I wore with it to turn as well.I look more like blue medusa than Marie Antoinette.I did not see this in the picture?Not at all like the pictures.The pants are okay but how they look is different than the picture.The upper red crystal is in fact red but the pearl isnt, it's a very noticeable pink lor.Although it's difficult to tell in the picture, they are very pink.The picture on the right is after I took the red Sharpie to them and lored them red.They became dislored around the edges.. like a pper lor.Fits good, but the logo is so pixelated.Mercedes logo is extremely faded and hard to see on tshirt.They fit great but was a little disappointed because I only received rings instead of and we're black, was silver and was lored which was pretty much all green.The main lor is nowhere near the pink it looks in the picture.Doesn't this look like black, rose and cream in the photo?Nope, it's pink, navy and white.I know sometimes lor is a little lighter or darker on monitors but this bag is no where near the saddle tan it's supposed to be.Pros: Color is just as advertised Cons: The necklace came broken in the mail.The lors looked like they had been bleached by the sun.Too bad cause the lor is great.lor is not as vibrants as photoshopped picture.I know lors on the internet are difficult to determine, but this tie appears black with the red striping on my screen, and it's most definitely not black in person.It's tolerable but the buttons on it is big and dark brown, not gold buttons like shown.I do like it even though the Material is a different blue from the picture more of a darker blue.I like the pattern and lors, but it's quite small and unmfortableLove the design but the lors on the shirt I received are extremely faded and look nothing like the picture.Would return it due to the faded lor but since it was so cheap and was shipped from China I decided it wasn't worth the hassleThough the lor is very prettyThe skeleton print is off.It turned black ( is very prettyLens too darkNot very good but it does look like the picture.It's bit bright so if you like to stand out than this is the lor for youI ordered the red top and the lor is dull and dingy.I like these a lot but I was a sent a white tank top instead of a blue one.Cute but the red bleeds into your clothes.Was cute but faded after the first wash and each watch after thatJust like how it look displayed on the picture..Received too many red mittens, no black mittens which is what I was looking for.Ring started to turn black at the bottom.And turned my finger green.They look just like the picture.Was black and silver but says it's black and white when you order it.very disappointed in the lors we receivedCute printOk but product showed up and its not totally white.May return, but does not look like the picturesIt wasn't white as shown in the picture, it was more an off white.Ok....wouldn't order again...not like picture.Definitely not like the picture.Too bad because the pattern is really cute.I bought pairs of these jeggings the lors are great, but as others have warned, they don't stretch.The fit was fine but the lors are nothing like what is pictured.They were very faded and all the lors weren't there.My package did not ntain the lors as shown.Instead were mostly hideous dark Pepto-Bismol pinks and shockingly bright lavenders, the ugliest lors you can imagine.Cute necklace...but it changed lor after one wear.I ordered White as stated but was sent BEIGE, that was not listed.Otherwise I would give it a one star.It Is too small and different lorShirt is nearly black making it hard to see writing.Bought these for my year old boy with the assumption that they were red like the description says.However, they are more like a pink lor.The big upset was this particular print.Doesn't look like pictireit did not look like the pictureCute lime pictures but to small Gave it to my sisterCute but came dislored..did not was well..In the pictures these go straight down, very professional looking.The black pair I got first came in with no packaging, just thrown in the box my other stuff came in.The pink ones are not % tton like the black ones and I was allergic to them.The lor was not as pictured and I ended up giving it away.Looks nothing like the picture not even to the lor.It isn't red, more a burnt orange.It looks red online but once you get it's an off redThe blues on the top look close in lor in the pictures, but definitely not in person, the pattern is far more pronounced which I did not like, or I would have gotten the darker lored one).But it's definitely an attempted py of the suit in the pictures.The veil looks like there are polka dots all over it instead of rhinestonesIt looks cheap, and the lor is not what is on the website.They didn't look anything like the picture.Not how the picture is shown.....Colours are faded I'm worried about washing them.the lor was not at all like the picture.My bust area sucks up the front of the blouse, so it didn't look like the picture.. love the lor thou.Awkward yellow.Too Small, lors are not like in the picture...Not to mention that they are polarized?It rived too small and wrong lor.Little disappointing but I ordered another one just to try to get the right size and lor.Very disappointed with the outme of the lors but I will give it two stars only because it had pockets.Just the silver gray is too tight.Super disappointed because the lor is great.Very pale gray and doesn't go with either of the shoes or boots I got it to go with.Doesn't look like itThe lor does not look like the pic.it uld be cute, but is much thinner than it appears in the picture.Not even close to the rrect lor.They don't really look like the picture.The shirt didn't even have a brand.The print also was not like shown mine was more faded n lors weren't as bright as shown in picture.not red like the photo.The golden elements are already rrode, thats a pitty because I should change them.The assorted lor studs are mostly pink...not much variety.RAN VERY SMALL, COLOR TOO BRIGHTPart of that is my fault because I assumed it was a woman's robe from the pictures but it really is unisex'.As far as the imaging and wording being blurry/pixelated I guess you get what you pay for.I ordered a black, RFID wallet and although the box is labeled black, the lor is indistinguishable from the old, brown one.I will look at another brand where black is really black.The black" one I received has the same dark stitching shown in the item image.Pattern is pretty.The add photo looked like a deeper blue grey.I also thought it was black, but it's actually charal grey.The white and black came separate but in similar packaging.The sleeves are too tight and the stripes ate very poorly stitched.To small beautiful lorThe shirt looked off white which is what I wanted, The shirt came in a not off white but a pale neon yellow that reminded me of my puppy's accidental puddles... not really what was pictured.Different lor then pictured.The label says emerald green but shows a teal passport ver.I ordered the red rose, one size.Its a frumpy lor though.Or else it'll turn you green and the lor will peel off.See they looked similar but while I was expecting a burgundy I received a red.not like the pictureThe front is red but it turns into a bright orange at the back.It's still faintly there but I think it will fade mpletely after the next washing.The dress didn't look anything like it does in the picture.The part on the top is really tight, and the lor is lighter than in the picture.LOVE the lors but the cut was so sloppy.No way I uld wear this without getting cross-eyes ) the pattern is bold, after all, so mistakes really show up).Wrong lor.I ordered a royal blue and was given what looked like a navy, which is a lot lighter.So either I was sent the wrong lor of shirt, or it appears different in the photo.It is hot pink stripes.. not even close to red in any lighting.Doesn't look like that in person.They sent me the wrong lor, twice.This is not like the picture.The green is more of an army green which isn't bad, just not what's on the picture.The gold looked really spray painted on The lor was really pretty though.Looks nothing like picture, is bright orange in real life.If I put it under a close, bright light, it looks a bit more aqua-lored, but when worn, it looks like a silver pave, with some small, dark green accents.cute idea but doesn't look like the pictureDidn't like the fact it turned my figment green andNot what it appears in the photo at all.Also the Flamingo is veryyyy orange.I thought it was shades of pink in the photo but theres a lott of orange through out and it looks tacky.I didn't notice the purple till after get got rx lenses in and my son wore them out in the daylight.We received these PJ's and although the waist and leg bands are red all the print is ORANGEDisappointed it didn't look more like the picture.Im nfused about this product, it states that the jacket is denim.Pretty design, lor and ncept....just VERY thin.I chose the tan lor and it looks almost yellowish.not oversized as portrayed.I expect that a little with white, but this is totally sheer.The white of the Jack Daniel's label looks far more blue than white.Colors appeared very faded upon arrival, and was poor quality.The lor say purple but it's fuschia, the arms seems little tight too and the hood is poorly doneIt doesn't look very much like the pic at all (Cheese you anklet that turned my ankle black.The sequins are smaller than they appeared in the photo, and keep falling off.It also didn't look like what I ordered.The smell of the product is awful and the lake blue lor is not even similar to the lor shown.It looks like a silver blob with tiny red highlights.Like the print.The lors were off and it had way more of a southwest look then I expected.Ok for starters these are nearly clear with almost no hints of green to my disappointment.This dress does not look like the picture.Also the lor was a nice red, it looked more dull than the picture so over all really wasn't worth buying.Can't even see the white lines in the picture.By the way, there are white lines on the shirt.I wish it look like the pic.It had a big blue blob on thw front.The lor looked like they were very old.I got a beige one, but the lor is quite unattractive unlike the picture.It is a lot darker and has ripple patterns(if you magnify, you might be able to see).This was a Christmas gift and the wife loved the grey lor but if you are not a thin model you may not want this dress....Nice set however after a few wear of the necklace it started to change lor ..I liked it so much I ordered another in red, but the red one arrived with of the jewels having already fell out.The picture is barely visible.I didn't really like them it doesn't look like anything in the picture.Very thin, the red/burgundy not as bright as photo.Not at all what the picture seems.It was NOT anything like the image depicted in the photo.The lor and material is MUCH darker.It reminds me of some s jumper Pam Grier would have worn in Foxy Brown.The black also looks more like shamu than a shark.within one hour of wearing it turned green very dissatisfiedThe shirt doesn't look like the picture, just similar.It doesn't look at all like the pictureSo its hard to tell what the image is.Does not look like the picture Does anyone know where I can get a ring like this where it doesn't turn you green?its not as long as the picture its not as full an there is a white part in the middle i don't like itIt looks as it is on the picture but it's not cm.I ordered this sweater in two lors and unfortunately had to return both of them as the lors were way off.The Coral was actually a hot pink, and the Light Blue which appears aqua blue on the site is more of a gray blue.So I ordered the red and black, they were cute but to small.It was cute when I first received it, but it just changed.(FYI, the red is MUCH brighter than it seems, though.They don't stay up like in the picture.The lor I ordered was the aquamarine and it doesn't look anything like the lor portrayed in the description, it's more of a dark blue almost.The lor is way different, too dark.I received the one in grey last week and it was very short and the product was not what I was expecting at all.I do not like orange, peach, or salmon maybe, but not Orange.It's not; it's just lors on a thin wrap.All of the beads which were supposed to be purple were almost mpletely clear void of any lor on the bracelet I received.Disappointed in it not being aligned and professional looking.But was very disappointed that it was not white as picturedWorse than the picture.First IT IS NOT white and it DOES NOT SHAPE like the picture.Color was reddish orange, and the tail is awkwardly small.My problem is that the orange doesn't match the lor in the photo.The glasses I got were a neon orange and I pretty sure the lor changes in sunlight and gets almost a little pink as I wear them throughout the day.It's different than the photo you published.not like photoThe way it is presented in picture is VERY MISLEADING.It doesn't look cropped in the photo.I don't like it cropped, I want to return.Plus there is writing and an old year in the grey spot that you don't see when ordering the product.Blue and red was SUPER faded......nothing like the picture.I recieved what appeared to be washed out pink as opposed to neon pink.it was suppose to be Yellow but its not...It look more like a mint green... will be sending it backDidn't look like the picture.So upset cause I really loved the style and white looks great with a tan, and the price wasn't bad either.All the lored ones started looking the lor when I wore them.funny but came so flat a creased we sent it backIt looks different from the product description too, it's solid gray on the back and a different lor blue on the front.Additionally, after I took it off I left it at home, and I found the edge was turning.green like ashy green like that super cheap metal.Loose lor extremely fastPicture looks like A-line skirts,but it's just tight skirts.As an aside, the hat is pretty bad and the red sashes aren't the same lor as the red skirt.Feel very light and kind of cheap- pretty lor thoughNot the same as the picture.It came with a yellow lens.The lors are actually darker than the one shown in the picture.The lors look nothing like the picture.Pretty sure they sent me the wrong lor and now it's too late to get a new pair in before Halloween, thus, ruining my stume.Its pretty although kind of small and the lors are not the same as in the pictureI ordered a large thinking the shirt was seperate from the actual jacket and i was annoyed when i opened it and found it was sewn together....It was cute, but the sizing is all kinds of messed up.The reason why it isn't getting the other stars is because the Air Assault badge was printed on slightly crookedDon't expect to get the skirt pictured in the first images.the lor are way diferent than that picturethe brown was to dark, the nose was pink not red like the picture... etc.Cute style and lors, the idea of this romper is cute, but way too sheer and runs very small.It has little red speckles all over it, but they uldn't have me from us or our house.The lor is NOT navy, it's like clown ugly blue like a boys toybox lor.The pictures make it look darker than it is but the close up is closer to the lor.So cute in the picture but too small and the lor was quite a bit more orange that I had anticipated.This has two lors in it and the one lor looks fakeColors are innsistent.Not cut like the picture at allColors are faded and are not bright as shown in picture.i ordered this dress in white and when it came it was blue so i returned it and ordered the white again and again i was given the wrong lor besides that the dress is niceIt doesn't really look like the picture.California is spelled wrongReally pretty, but it turned lors really quickly -(I love the print but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to make the dress I received, look like the dress pictured.sending back i bought a green one and a purple one the same size that fit this does notlor is far more orange than ral" and fit is way smaller than the other I bought at the same time.The lor is way of from the picture it doesnt match my watch:-(The top is like a pink one you'd get from Walmart.Color on photo looked charal.The printed stars on the skirt is not even screen printed right.You end up with a pair of blue underwear that has peeling white dots all over it.Cute print, really short.There are other amber products that you can get, avoid this one.I will turn it round for the pictures Design is blurry and scales are a mix of dark purplish lor and orange.I ordered purple leggings and got something that was closer to eggplant to black.They top part was as expected from the picture but the tutu bottom was BRIGHT NEON ORANGE.But pretty disappointed in the fact that they do not look like the picture.I didn't notice in one of the pictures the top looked more of a cream lor and in the send pic it was white.The bottoms you uld see the black stitching on the white.I ordered the white so maybe the black would work.The image shown in the assorted lors were not the ones I received.A very bright blue to be nsidered distressed looking.Just opened the package....This shirt is purpleThis fit as expected however the bottom lor appears blue and white in the photo and was actually black and white.Not what the example looked like.The reason I returned it is the black and white lining is SO stiff its scratchy and unmfortable.Plus you have to wear the hat way above your head in order to see the print on it.I had to return it as the logo was was not ironed on straight.Not as expected returned didn't look anything like the photo.Not look like pic.If you want to look like a pimp on a bowling vacation this is the shirt for you.Beautiful lors and as advertised, but as soon as I put my fingers in the fingertip holder ones of them ripped right off.These glasses also do not appear to be polarized.It doesn't look like in the photo.Th print is nice though so I will prob wear with some jeans and a crop jacket.My disappointment is with the lor.Not like photo.I only gave it stars because it's DMB but what you get is not what is pictured.The lor is darker than the picture and the wig is way too long.Also the lors sent are horrible dark purples.The lor is mpletely different from the picture and I dint like it.The description did say assorted lors, which I expected, but it did not say lors would vary.Very wrong lor.Brick red turns out to be bright orange.didn't look like the picNot true to lor and shorter than picturedI ordered blue and received grayFirst the lor-Very deceptive.The at is actually well made and heavy but the lor was a bad omen.I wondered why they showed a honey lor when, in fact, it is much darker.The reason is that the dark lor doesn't really work as well with this jacket; it looks frumpy---like a .Liked the lor but was too big and terribly unflattering hemline accentuating hips.If you want a top to go with something else that is white, don't buy this.Ordered a white, which I was unable to see through the photos provided and the whole dress was white with no lor distinction like the picture.Dark red not the red you show.The pattern is pretty on the bottom but I will need to return it.Was disappointed with the lor of the shorts cuz I though it was like a light beige but this was more towards a light soft pinkish ral.It's plain red pper.What I received didn't mpletely match the picture..That being said, they were really pretty I got the blue ones) and I might have kept them except they were way too big for my face.Color mpletely differentThe lor looked different in person than in the picture.There's a design on them that makes it look more grey.The socks are black but the design which vers most of it makes it look more grey.Haven't tried them on but might be returning simply bc I was looking for blackThe lor from the picture is also a bit lighter than in person.I ordered the brown ones.Nothing like the picture...even the lor was bad.The white one was too small...?First of all, the lor was nothing like I expected.I saw a pink and ral floral pattern on my screen yes, I know they're variable) and so when I pulled something closer to neon orange or if the box, I was a bit surprised.I received an entirely different print, lor, and style.Print is almost nonexistent.It is more of a grey.The print is faded as if it was already worn.it is a beautify jumpsuit, the lor is like a yellow banana whereas the picture looks more like a mustard lor.If this was made differently I would have bought ever lorI'd looked forward to buying more lors but with the unpredictable sizing, front drooping and small snaps, I'll look for another brand.The picture of the green tights makes them look shiny but they are not.Cons are that the print is smaller than pictured, and the label" is already starting to fade/me off.I can only assume that within the next month the print and lor on the label will have mpletely disappeared.I like the pattern and the graphic however.Doesn't look like picturingReally pretty ring.. Lost it's silver Grey lor in a week and turned orange around the bottom of the band :It is very thin and see through and I got navy blue a dark lor.Does not, I repeat, does not look like it does in this pictureI think if a product is advertised in such a way that it seems you would receive all three lors, you should get all three.Which also left the hem part white, part grey ......The dress doesn't look like the picture.Cute, but lor not like the picture showsPicture appears to have more fur than what I received.So the symbol goes waaaaay to the right and leaves a lot of black on the outer edge.The dress is pretty, but I was instantly turned off by the black pet hair that was all over it.Def not army green nothing like the pictureIs different from the picture not even closeIt is not the lor that I ordered and it is way shorter than it appears.The neckline I received does not appear as in the photo.It's cute, but the numbers are difficult to see against the background.The floral pattern is screen printed on and you can't tell that from the picture.it is not that long at all like it is in the picture.I like product but it starting to change lor.Also the lor is not the same.Not as pictured...these are brown and beige not black and white.I liked the gathered look in the picture) of the sides of it, but when I try them on, not so much.The one I received is gray.Very pretty design but I'm very disappointed in the lor.And the lor is way more pink than red.The lor is not green, it is teal, which was still pretty, but the lace is bright white not beige either.However, I got the gray one because the reviews for the white one said it didn't block out light.The tint isn't dark enough either.It was not like what the picture showed.Too thin, th lors aren't as shown.The description said it was red and navy.This product is very see through at least the yellow one is It wasn't an actual screen print.This is not the one I ordered and it stretches out all weird, not the lor I wanted or ordered, doesn't fit too bad thouThe print is speckled light grey, NOT WHITE, and there is a printing flaw by the head.Did not like the lor and sent them back.I got the bag but it was the wrong lor.I think it'd be okay if you just want to wear it under your clothes to appear to have a more hourglass figure when you go out.I don't know if I was sent the wrong style, or this was advertised wrong, but I'm extremely disappointed.did not look like the picture i was disappointed so i sent it back See the send picture.Look for something else.the picture shows , the mments say that are included in the price yet I only received one gold one I really wanted the white and the black.Again the bottoms are fine, the lor is just whats pictured, I would say the tops are mis-labeled a size or two too big.It is okay, doesn't really look like the picture; was desperate and out of time so keeping this dress.The shirt fits as expected but the red is hardly a red.Definitely did not look like the picture in terms of lor.Does not look ANYTHING like the picture.The logo on the shirt we got sticks to itself.Way too small and the lor was more black than blue--a very odd lor.It does not look like the picture I returned it for RED>The one I got is red, blue and pinkish background.First off, the mpany sent me the wrong print which wasn't too much of a problem seeing as the print I received was my send choice but be warned that it uld happen to you.not as attractive on as appears in pictureIts a pretty enough bright green, but it also swishes when you move.Not what the pic looks likeDefinitely did not look like the picture.Image and text are pretty pixilated...I have seen the image before it looks like a low res py.The lors don't bleed or anything.Cute but the lor is a little dull mpared to the pictureDon't get the white.Cute pattern though.But the more I look at them the more I'm starting not to like them if that makes any sense.Only disappointment was, the lor in the picture is brighter than the actual dress, it's off white, not white like the picture.I really wanted all of the lors shown to match with flannel shirts though.The one I got I s a very blurry print.We have been disappointed with the print of the Beatles walking across Abbey Road.The print is out of print fuzzy).This dress looks just like it does in the picture.I have not noticed any lor fade.it's bright red, very nice besides the buttons which seem a little tacky.Overall...not really like the pics shown.I got the glasses with the purple/blue lens and black frame.Does not look like photo too much hairAlso the lor of the lable is darker more like fucshia than hot pink.It almost looks red sometimes.The other thing is I think their loring names is wrong because as you can see the picture of the red" dress is more like an orange.I bought it because I liked the way that looked in the picture, and disappointed that it doesn't really look like that.Ordered the orange and it was too smallThey're listed as orange shown as more a yellow-orange and when they arrived, they're super bright NEON orange.If I uld post a picture to show actual lor, I would.Its not like the picture.Cute dress, very high quality, but the lor, which looked like a peach in the picture, was too orange.The lors and striping look kind of cute on the model, but I feel like it looks awkward and a little too sporty on me.Also the yellow is a little too bright for me.Other than that it is as described and I uld use if the lor were different.Brown one has pointless) derative centre seam as usually illustrated) front and rear.It doesn't look much like the picture.However, the lor shows light pink green.the only thing is that you only can wear it just auple of times because after a few uses it will turn dark and black.I have the black one also, which I would say looks alot nicer.Don't look like the picture on youI do like the lor, however.My biggest disappointment is the lor.The rest is not, and turned my wife's nose green.Also, the sides were clear, not white like it seems in the picture.Such a shame because the lors I got are absolutely exquisiteThis was a pretty lor, but this heather" version is unpleasantly rough-textured, unlike other shirts of this type I've tried.OK hat --- lettering is not bright and looks a littleAgain, I ordered the grey and disliked the material, but I really like the white one.I like the lor and the buttons down the front.Doesn't really look llke the pictureColor don't look like the picture I order the gray and i thought it was green.This is the red dress I was going to wear them with.It's most certainly lighter in lor than the picture shown in the product description see and mpare to my photo below).Doesn't look like picturesthe lor, quality and pattern was nice but unfortunately it was too small for me.Not the same lor as the picture and runs small.Its too bad, because I love the purple dino print.Plus it's not black the way it's describes; more like a dark, dull gray.lor was not as pictured.The red is almost a burgundy.This dye was not what I expected.Box and bottle are printed Cordovan".I also thought it was going to be grey and white and it kind of is but it's more of a heather grey-blue that I'm not fond of.Lack of lors in sizes needed.It still has blocky white edges along the body of pyramid head.But I have washed it and the lors and size did not change.Cute....but the green ones are not jadeThey left a green stain" on my earsStill somewhat orange, just not the shade I was hoping for/expecting.Since I ordered it in white and looked at those pictures, I didn't realize that the sleeves also flared out.The lor is deceiving.It looked as pictured, maybe a little more red than pink.The only reason I ordered these were for the purple ones so I was disappointed when I got them and saw that they were so dark that they actually looked black...Really see through- even in red.They look very cute on, just like the photo.The buttons don't match right so it's kind of weird.This dress did not look like the photo.I would remmend avoiding the gray lor, as I do look like I've recently escaped an asylum when wearing them.When I received them the red was more of a pinkish red, and the black tie was actually gray.However, the cranberry stripe looks faded out from certain angles.That might be what they mean by metallic cranberry."The lors while very bright and bold upon arrival faded extremely fast, after the one accidental drying the lors appear to be as though they've been washed and dryer for years and years.Colors are fading in patchesIf it turns or fades after that; I won't be disappointed.the are flags like but not the ones pictured.but the lor i got the red) is not what it looks like to me.Comft but eyes were misalignedBead lors were beautiful and beads looked symetrical as promised, but I had to return unopened because one of the tube caps had me off in transit.also, the lor is misleadingPretty lor, very thin, and not as floaty" as it appears in the photo.I ordered grey and it is darker than the grey in the photo which is a bit disappointing I have a white German shepherd who sheds a lot so I was taking a chance with grey to begin with.A little too gray.THE RED BLED ONTO THE WHITE ON THE BOOT COVERSThe product is a lot more of a vibrant pink than the blazer in the photo, which appears to be a softer pink.But it is not flared as it looks in picture.I ordered in red and was expecting a really deep red, almost crimson.However the lor in the bag is more like a dark fushia.See the Picture.Picture and description says and shows yellow and pink.Not bad, sorta cheaply made but still decent, although the lor is not as dipicted / I ordered aqua but it's deffinatly more of a dusty blue lorThe lor in the photo is different from what I got like I got dark orange lor.My girlfriend bought three different lors and received two different brands.She would give five stars for the turquoise lor and two stars because she can still fit in it even though it's snuggier than she'd like for the other two so she mpromised with three stars for the rating.Really cute but of the pinks ones, rners weren't glued into place, so they lift away from the frame.The lor was actually kind of orange.Even though it's a nice feeling shirt, the lors and the look caused me to return this one.It doesn't really look like the picture but it's okay.I purchased a black, and I can see the patterns of a bra through it so I wouldnt' wear these by themself.The lor in all the stones is faded and it does not look like the picture.Not red and black as it shown on the picture.While it appears much like the photo.But it was only okay mma not to mention that I truly didn't realize what it look like until I blew it up on the plane.The lor is not like the photo.just like photo...The main mplaint is that the lor is a much more aggressive pink/ral than what is represented in the peach" lor here. stars only because they all were black frames not mixed as shown.So we ordered the next size down...the lor was not as rich, the material was scratchy, it was sewn together mpletely different and it was still too big.The grey lor isn't really grey, more purple brownish.Color was more turquoise than green which disappointed meI ordered the red, and expected the torso to be white and sparkly like in the image.Disappointed...I love print but I expected it to be bigger.Unfortunately, the lored part of the purple headband her favorite lor) started unraveling the send time she wore it...we tried fixing it, but then it unraveled from the other side.If you look like The Buddha or Andre the Giant .. chose another brand.Faded to quickI expect that the dress be like the photo.I really like the tan one so I ordered two more lors and they're different.Girlfriend loved it, IMO more pixelated then imaged.In the photo, the yellow shows up very bright against the black shirt, but on mine it looks almost faded out and is difficult to read.Ran small, not true to lor.But they never knew the lor was off.I received the wrong print, but it was actually prettier than the other.there is an odd yellowish smear on the C,Oh but the printSo excited to get this bag but in the photo it looked more silver.It is definitely more orange than the pictureIt looks like a deep amethyst purple in the picture, but when you get it it is like a...light grey-ish purple.Unfortunately I have to return because the lor burgundy that arrived does not match the lor burgundy as in pictureI gave a star for the lour otherwise a But, these shorts are still super cute and look just like the pictureThe bottom looks blue on screen but it was definitely black.Just didn't look like the picture when I got it.The ruby is more like kinda orange/red like...but I Like-Iti like it but it turned my finger green after wearing it onceThe picture is very faded although I ordered the XL it looks like a medium.The picture looks creme but it is really white.I got the charal grey and the lace is like a greenish grey.But maybe that's because of the lour I chose.The lor choices are great, but the sizing is awful.Both lors were wrong.the lor fades on first washThe lor is deceptive online.Here is a pic of what it looked like...Like someone was rolling on the ground with it.Faded after first wash, very small.Color/pattern is not as pictured and half of the top was not mpletely top stitched so it looks half finished.It's also a darker pink than it appears online.It just doesn't look like the picture.Very dull in lordoesn't look anything like the picture, but you get what you pay for I suppose.Doesn't really look like picture, but I still like them.The print is much darker with a lot less detail than the picture but it's not horrible.This shirt is not white like in the picture.So disappointed, it was the perfect size, lor, shape....but it had burn marks on it.I realized that most of them were bleeding lor especially the dark ones.I'm not sure why this happened only for those lors black and blue but after I dried it off it was back to normal.Got the grey bottom.it was just all blackThe Hurley print was on the inside of the shirt and for this reason I haven't wore the shirt..Is the shirt returnable..?Doesn't look like the glasses in the photo.I'd previously ordered a blue/iridescent CK tie from Amazon that I'd assume the lighter blue socks in this -Pack would match.FYI, they are almost purple, not even periwinkle.However, I do not want everyone to be able to tell what lor under garments I am wearing and with this skirt, its very obvious.Based on other reviews, I may return and try a different lor.I have also debated dying the skirt a darker lor.However, after wearing the black one for a few days, one tassel felt apart and fell off.Baggier and lighter lor than picturedFront print was a little off-center.Looks just like the pic.Love the print but it doesnt look like the one on the pictureIt is a bit see though, but I got the camel lor so it wasn't as obvious as the white probably is.Hence I sent it back, even though I loved the lor and printThe lor was almost neon, much brighter than picture.The black with white hearts seem slightly see through.They are cute but do not look like the picture.loose around my rear as well an i am not a small grl so for a small to be loose on me is weird.cute lor thoughthe only problem I had with this is it tended to fade after awhile so it was pink rather then red.The print is cute and all, but the sizing is very disappointing.I like it but it's way lighter than the picture.The white jade" looks pink in the picture, but are really white in person.However the Strawberry lor does not match the bag I already had.The lor is different than the picture.BUT, the lor shown is a really pretty cholate brown, and the actual dress is a weird almost olive green.First time I put them on the dark blue and gray Captain America socks they ripped at the heel.The circle is way off center and the flames" which I thought were cute and why I purchased this shirt) are mpletly missing.Doesn't really look like the picture and it's a totally different lor of pink than pictured..The print on the main logo is decent.Also, garment was not white, but off white.It turned my arm red, but it is prettyJust received the shirt today, the lors are a bit different from the image shown.(In my opinion, not as pretty as the original paler pink lor, but also not horrifically ugly.)You can see the lor difference, but also how scratched up the k band isI like the lor but it's annoying that they roll down a little bit and all of the stripes don't show.they are more like a fairly light blush/ pinkish lor.It's not maroon but a rusty red.Very different than what's shown in the picture.Good lor, but when they arrived they were supposed to be small but were actually labeled -cm and were WAY too bit for my -x kiddo.This dress is not the lor that is pictured, nor is it the material or cut shown.Cute, but dislors in the salt water.I did, however, find that one pair of another lor line striped blue and green) had a hole in the crotch area.It's ok. Really a dark gray than what is shown in the picture.I needed something of a banana lor, so I had to send it back.But just doesn't look like silverI was going to return it but it end up having a cute oversize style to it.The dress looks like the picture.I ordered the hot pink in a small, I normally wear a small pre-pregnancy and the lor is beautiful but overall the material is too thin and too small.Like the lor, but it was really small, I had to return and re-order.It is not as long like the pictureI think it is overpriced for what it is.Silver Turned lor fast /Very cute style and print but disappointed in the sizing.The lor was way darker than what was pictured on several different mputer and phone screens Overall, it does seem to be an ok shirtOverall it looks like the picture.The only thing i found wrong was lor, it said soft pink, i got bright pink.Really pretty but starts turning lors quickly if you wear it too often.Ok, looks like the picThey do NOT have black hi lights like in the pictureI like the fit, but the lor looks more like navy blue than what the picture a pretty purple.The lor is nothing like it is pictured here...much...much...lighter in lor.If you truly want pink....I suggest you look elsewhere.I didn't like that lor yellow.If they had used a black background it would have made all the difference.It is more like dark dark gray.It would be nice if they would put the actual lor in the picture.I think it's overpriced for what it is.Blue pair had snags in them.However it does not match the picture.The O-H-I-O people bib is cute.Washed before I wore it and the black faded immediately.and turn darker, which looks exactly like I have dirt across the shirt.The red is so faded on the shirt.I have the same pair in black and they are not see through at all.The downside is that the picture on this hoodie is actually darker than the one shown in the picture on here.I didn't think the pattern resembled the picture at all.The lor matches photo in product description.Screen print.I see that side of the shirt some of the lor came off little bit on top and the bottom by the nameit's not as red as it looks on screenOnly thing is after a few weeks the gold mes off and turns your finger a different lor so she stopped wearing it.The lor is really pretty, and it is as pictured, but the the pockets bulge out in an unflattering way.This top is actually blue and dark khaki brown, not white as it looks like in the photo.The white lettering is a little faded and not as bright as depicted in the picture.The dress in the picture and the one that arrived are different.There is a good chance I go back and buy a different lor in a large.In the photo they look black but they were more like really dark denimWhites are more like grey in reality.Would have given it a if it actually was the same as shown in the picture.The front of it above the ID slot is a faded brown lor as well see pictures).Hell first it was to small and it wasn't the lor i wanted Product description was mixed lors, but I mistakenly thought I was ordering black, because the picture was erroneously black.I ordered the red but it has an orange red look to it.Nice lor a tad tight especially at hem.I gave it stars because I ordered the white lor however, received it with stainsKind of dissapointed at how the wolf doesn't really look like a wolf.Its a little more saturated lor.The pattern is cute but it is more of a shirt not a dress as it is suppose to be used for.But it just doesn't look like the photo.The dress came w/blue beads on it so trying to figure out how to replace the blue beads w/red beads without unraveling all the other beads.Stone was not as red as shown in picture, however for the price what should one expect.too bad the blue wasn't the same as the picture, it's more pale.The one I got is " x " x maybe ".I like the patterns, and the cut, that is just as expected.Did not like the lor to uglyAnd the lor bleeds.Because The lor blood off quite a bit and ruined if you have my clothes so I wouldn't remmend wearing it with light lors if you do get itThe lor is supposed to be a light brown but definitely has a noticeable orange tinge.It's a shame because it's really, really pretty otherwise and I had planned on getting other lors.You won't be able to get the look as in the pictureNot a black metal, it looks more silver, but the necklace looks as shown except for the lorIt is cute and appears just as it does in the picture.The front image was streaked with grey, light purple and blue and is difficult to tell what it is supposed to say.The back image was white and quite legible but it looked as though they made a print setup error causing a mirror-image outline which was offset to the right.Color not as bright... Top feel funny on...Doesn't look like the pictures.Jeans look lor in the picture then.The print is kind of mediocreNot as pretty as shown but I kind of like it...unless you pose like the picture.The lor is different from the picture.I thought it is dark green, but it is black.It's a nice lor, and a good size, but very cheaply made.It's ok. One of the blue beads leaves a blue spot on my wrist.The shirt looked a lot like it did in the picture I got the grey one) and it fit as expected.Not as expected when looking at the pictureI missing yellow flower, and clasp won't open"Tomato" looks more red in the photo but actually very orangeok pattern is a little different from the picture.The necklace turned black while turning my neck green, and the lor came off the back of the charm and is now an odd almost pper lor.Doesn't look anything like the picture on the model... Kind of disappointed.Doesn't me the way it is in the picture.does not look like in the picture on Amazon.Twice i ordered them and got the wrong lor and the third time the lor was right but was orangey and not red as expected.Bad lorThe red wasn't as it appeared online.The shoes were very cute though, but I returned them because it wasn't red I expected like it was a little more orangey red than blood red if that makes sense.The lor is not as shown in the picture, it is a much lighter blue and very flimsy looking.I did like the lor though.Color changed, silver tarnished, charm fell offThe burgundy lor was way more of a crimson red.There's not much oxidation on it the black) to make the letters and designs pop out.So all you see is a silver looking type angel wing shaped blob unless you look very very closely.Not what it shows in the pictureLike fit lors but found one that was a defectively sewn had to throw it out uldn't be worn.Unfortunately, one of the main flowers was only partially painted and silver metal showed through where it should have been purple.However, the lor is too orangey for me.I tried to find some standard red things to photograph so you can decide yourself.The stone does not look green at all.I'll give it an OK, but what I really wanted was the versatility of different blue lors that unfortunately I didn't get,If you are expecting a darker gray like the picture, you will be disappointed.The badges uld have been a but green diamond badge had some tarnish staining on it.The pattern is cute but I would not order this again.The inside of the dress is white though as opposed to black.I don't like the lored stiching.Looks like the picture.Faded after st washFine, just too orange to look like gold.I will be returning unfortunately because the lor is a tad off and not black its blue.Looks very close to the picturei like the lors and the look, but its too heavy and bemes annoying to wear after a few hours.It does not like picture as shown.The lors are not nearly as vibrant as the picture, it looks very washed out and more white than back.My only regret is I ordered the blue-stone one and I got a clear stone one.This pattern on the is very cute.Not what I expected, doesn't look much like the photo.But I nstantly tried and this item does not seem to glow in the dark like it says above.:( The shirts in the photo are the same XL size - you can see the difference between the new blue one and the earlier black one.However only the black agate plugs were g the other two were g.Cute shirt but the back looks different from the picture and the bow isn't the same lor -)It is cute" . but, the purple is next to impossible to see . not impressed.Only then, did I see the purple if I squinted really really hard.It wasn't that HOT....unlike the picture shown to the customersMine did not look like the picture.W-a-y overpriced.They seem well made, but the print was off mine were mostly pink?Pretty sure it's going to turn my neck green but what do you expect for Just as how the picture is (Purple)</a>&nbsp;which broke after minutes.I got the brown one with the gold H, but the back clap part is Silver.. kind of odd.Have purchased same jacket in another lor, but this one has the sizing wrong.It does look like the picture and is a cute bracelet however I thought it was a bunch of individual bracelets that lors uld be worn individually.I wasn't red, but more of an orange red; nothing like the lor in the pictureThe photo shows a lily white dress, but mine was off white and also dirty from the black print.Problem is, it doesn't look like the one in the picture.The picture shows the hexagonal texture but the final is missing that and has some stitch pattern similar to the solid lighter blue one.Like on picture.Not like pic.However the sleeves and bow aren't black as pictured, but the same lor as the rest of the dressThe screen print is blurry.I almost returned it but it is so pretty and sparkly.I wish the lor was lighter like the picture portrays, Ruffles in the shoulders are too muchThis dress is very pretty-the purple lor is lovely but it definitely runs on the smaller side.the shirt is not gray its more like a brownish lor.The lor was a little different from what it appeared, I thought I was ordering more of a light lavender, but it appeared to be more of a pink lor.does not look like the picture.The lor on the receipt says burnt umber.Looks just like the pictureMisleading lor.I ordered navy with white pattern, instead received the one in the pic.Great lor just a little big and cheaply made to me.My only mplaint is about the lor.Even though it's an orange and white watch, when it chipped, it now has a pink tinge to it and he won't wear it because he's afraid people will make fun of his pink watch.The black stripes on the dress bled onto the white of the dress after I washed the dress.I have only worn this a few times but the yellow plating has almost worn totally off.I has gone from looking too yellow k look) to minimally yellow k).The maroon lor does not show sweat very much and this would depend on the lor you pick.i am very partial to the tint that sunglasses have though and these ones, while fire red reflective has a blue tint when looking through.I love the amber tint so im kinda annoyed but its not the end of the world.Get a darker lour so that your underwear Etc is not visible.Nice at, but never would have bought it if I have seen the review of it being the wrong lorAlso, each lor runs a bit different in size.It folds really bad where the red arrows indicateds the cinching affect.But I received the black with tan polka dots instead of the navy as requested.I ordered this for my son bday and he really loves it it looks kinda of faded but it goes with the style.Color is extremely faded from the blue.The wallet I received is as pictured, lor is bright, however it did not me with the cute little tassel.ok item and are really cute but the eventually they get all bleckThe lighter lors are hardly visible on the shirt which makes it look more like a zebra print than camo.I can fix" that.... otherwise, it's cute.I do like the lor, though.Also the lor on that side started to diminish its brightness and was not the same lor as the other shoe.I wasn't crazy about the print.the llar is nothing like it is in the picture.When I opened the purple one I was shocked by the chemical smell.The different lors seem like they are two totally different sizes.I payed more to find a print my son would really love for his birthday this one marked prints and solids and they sent me solid black and grey.in person, the lor looks a bit more red than it does in the pictureNot as dark as in picture.Says purple rhinestones but they are pink and fewer than what is picturedI got one pair in ral and another pair in black.I ordered these because they look different in the photo,but identical to another pair that i ordered on here that seems stume like.However, the rose lor depicted in the picture was much darker than the real lor.The whole outline of the image and the Jack Daniel's picture, etc is grayish blue.Colors are not as bright a bit muddy.Confusing to put onThe lor is not what this picture looks like...These are a little smaller and lighter in lor.lor was wrong.Colors are different then what the image shows.I was disappointed that the background lor is a washed out pink as opposed to the vibrant pink pictured.Unless they mean the brown cardboard box all Amazon stuff ships in, I'm missing a box.Also the purple ones came as just white and I was really disappointed.May be it would do the trick in a different lor, but it looks cheap in white.I like the lor and style, however when I went to try it on it did not go past my knee.The Bad: The lor description is not rrect.I ordered the yellow but it's actually a tan lor.faded really quick.I ordered the black and red one and I think the red one actually looks nicer but the black should go with everything.This shirt is pretty especially in the black but runs large.Gave the lored away and I will wear the black one with tights.First of all, they sent me the wrong lor.The lor isn't true to the photos, it is clearly white in the pictures I have monitors on my desk to mpare) and the skirt that I received was blue...how does white beme blue again?I thought they were pink (... they are brown...Thats not my only problem however, It also is more of a bright orange as opposed to the sand tones that make it look like African fabric.It is a cute product for a photo prop, but again it isn't as large as it appears on line.However, the other pairs Black and Black White Petal Power) are both smaller and not as soft.The one that arrived was tan, not brown as pictured, it's very soft, but its the wrong lor.The pattern is much blurrier than it appears in the picture.The picture is very pretty and really stands out against the black background.Does NOT look like the picture.....nope not even close.I did realize it was white.Color is as pictured.It's like a digital print.All in all, I'll be wearing it but I wouldn't buy another print.Super dissappointed.I ordered the blue and it's a nice quality shirt but runs very small.It's cute but dosent look like the picI didn't like the reddish lor..It came quicklyI loved this shirt at first but after like washes the black bleed into the white and now it's some weird grey lorThe red on the pants doesn't match the top- it looks more orange than red.All of the shorts I got lors) were very thin fabric.It was hard to tell from the picture on Amazon but it is a tee shirt with the image printed on it.Not oversize at all.This shirt had a few mislabels" eg.Outfit is cute, but the cut if the shirt was definitely more of a little girls style and the loring of the pants was more of a maroon than orange.Loved the pattern/print, liked the material, disappointed with the fit.Did not look like the picture at all in personI didn't realize the back of the shirt is white.The lor was a bit pinker than it appeared in the picture (I bought the orange ones).I ordered a black shirt and they sent me a grey one.Also, he had expected the red sides" uld also fold in.It will work...but was disappointed that it was not the lor expected.I am mostly disappointed in the lor though.Color true to pic but was very large and fabric felt like that of a parachute.Background is a beige not grey as picture appearsWay too orange.Also, it's really pretty and I get lots of mplements I have the blue one).The pink ones hurt between my toes.Colors are a little different than pictured, but still is really cuteThe print was bright.More orange that it looked to me in the picture, but that uld just be from my mputer screen.The skirt fits good but the lor is somewhat different in reality.The reason for stars is the lor that I received is way too dull from the pic on the website and that's why I am returning it, but I will buy it in a different lor.It's a cute green thoughThe actual belt was extremely orange, and not really brown or tan at all like the image makes you assume.The shirt didn't look like the picture.Dress is pretty but the lors somewhat vary from one in picture.If the lor was any lighter it would have been see through.THE COLOR FADED VERY QUICKLYsuper cute pattern/lors, probably should've gotten a medium bc the top is a little small.Not as lose as in the picture.There looks like paint on the background.It's suppose to look like that?Not crazy about the light brown purse.Color is darker than picture But the lor is as pictured.The lor, to my eye, is a bit too loud, and the print too big.From the pictures it feels that it should be very dark but in reality the top half of the face is very light gray, and the bottom is darker but still much lighter than expected.This particular lor is on the small side--it fits differently than the other two hats I have by this same mpany.However, the lor is lighter than pictured in the purple which is disappointing and my reason for only stars.They I bought blue and yellow) are a bit flimsy, edges turn up so you have to iron or accept.This is an extremely dark shade of grey that basically appears black and the lavender is bright purple; what I nsider electric".They look more denim" than black" to me so I returned them.I should have looked closer at the picture.Too small, lor not as pictured.Cute print, but runs small.Not even a biege blush lor.More like a gray lor than black.Colors are vibrant I ordered red) and material is not flimsy.I would have given it or stars but totally not the lor it shows in picture.My biggest disappointment was that I didn't receive the lor in the photo- apparently assorted" means they'll send you whatever they want.Instead it was black with white stitching.There was no red on the purse--it was all black and white.Com with different lookI returned because there was a black line across the leg.I ended up buy Apple's version because I really like the bright green.They are spot on as depicted in the picturesThe blue is actually part of the dress and not a separate piece.So...I love the print of the suit....however..I ordered a medium because the reviews said to order up I am usually a small).picture looks pink but they are ral, dark ral.Cute, but definitely turn your finger green.the only thing is: it doesn't look like the pictureOverall would buy again but disappointed in the false description.It was not the same lor and it was small but I will still keep it.Not like photo at all, they are actually purple kinda bummed but they are good quality cheap.These shirts don't hold their shape, and the royal blue has innsistent lor after first wash.The shirt fit well but I returned it because the wrong lor was sent.I like it though, very light and aery.I ordered it in army green and it came in grey.I reordered it again to see it I get the rrect lor.Didn't give the option to choose a lor even both are ahown.I was disappointed it was kind of a pink gold, I was hoping for more of a yellow gold.Liked it except jordan is underneath the arm so no one can see.My biggest mplaint is the large Y&G gold logo that's painfully obvious to anyone you're talking to that you want to give your business card too.Turned dark really fast and fingers green.Brown is not as advertised.Just don't expect them to look like the picture.It was ok.the lor is much more paler than what it looks in picture...love the sleeves though.The shirt is cute and s rich lor, but smaller than the size should be.Unfortunately, the Cream lor was more of a light pastel yellow than what is pictured.A little too bright beige.but still cuteMine lost the black lor after first month now are turning a pper lorthis item appears to be Grey from the pictures.really pretty but the T-shirt is actually yellow, no green...I do, however, really love the lor I got brown) and they're cheap enough for me to want to keep them and wear them on upper body days at the gym.Although the lors are pretty, the shirt is very thin and light weight.Kind of a bummer, whole point was to buy my girlfriend's favorite lor for her.It looks like the picture.Very disappointed in the lor.Necklace is pretty to wear and pairs best with dark lored outfits.print not expectedWhat I received was a target perhaps the Target logo??).First the sweater is not oversized like the picture.other then that, the maroon is as shown and its cute just not like the pic's fit at all, unless your a child's /The lor is not like the picture it is ligtherAdorable but the lors faded after just a few weeks.This top is nowhere near the lour displayed here It's not a bad lour blue but it is % not as it appears here.It's a great shirt except the lor isn't a peachy pink it looks more like Pepto bismo pinkGold wore off after a while, but I guess that should be expected.As in they don't match, different.The print isn't as dark of a blue as I thought but it's ok. Just like the picture it is a little see through so I will have to put something under it but I expected that.the blue runs small?The lor is terrible.I can say they do look adorable, and I knew that horizontal stripes would be a big risk on a pear-shaped woman.Sorry I didn't pick red.The lor of the dresses Ordered for my bridesmaids) are pretty, but the top is nothing like what it is in this picture.Look different than the picture.The lor supposed to be red and it is ral.This lor is really a deep raspberry, looking for something to wear it with, expected pinker lor.Pretty pattern, so I switched the top out and wore the bottoms with another top.Five stars, but overpriced.Ir doesn't look flare like the photoit's pretty but it barely glows even in the dark).After first wash, lor faded in spots.Color was different than photo.I ordered of these shirts one in a different print, they are both XL.I had hoped for lors of brown and of black instead my readers were all black...These seem like the kimono style onsies that I was looking for and typed into the search engine).I got this top and another in a different lor to go under another top.It was really white, and then the ivory was still too white.Another minus is that the lor changes because of breath ndensate, so there is a small spot of water in the nose/mouth area which does not look flattery.Weird blue lor.True to size, but disappointed with the lor.Cute, vibrant lors, runs VERY small.The letters are kinda blurry, but overall I am ntent.I thought from the picture that they looked like more fall lors.My other issue is less important and it's with the lor.I purchased the navy and it's a really dull and frumpy navy blue.When it came the lor was mpletely different.The pilling is lighter in lor, so it's fairly obvious that something is off from quite a distance.The item said it was white but it is not white.The only disappointment is that it is not white as I had wanted.Also, the hands do not glow in the dark.they kind of look like like scrubs when I tried them on.It's a nice shoe however I ordered them in Red and was sent Pink, I had to send them back I don't wear pink shoes, I was very disapointed...Color is TOTALLY different than the picture.As far as design is ncerned, the metallic gold symbol on my case black pleather with blue interior and lining) is a total eye-sore.Turned brown and made my wrist green after a month.I would give them Stars if they were actually rose goldMost disappointing was that the base/background is light yellow, but the first photo makes it look white.You have to wear white undies or no underwear, do to the pattern or different lor undies showing through the light lor of the dress.Doesn't do much for the person it was given too sort of dissapointedOverall this kimono is pretty cute.Based on the pics I thought it wouldn't be very sheer with bright loring, but it's pretty sheer and the lors are more dull than I thought.Otherwise, I like all the pockets, and the lor.I believed the bathing suit to be more of a green tone, but it is actually black.Plus, I was quite disappointed to see that the dress lor is not as white as it appears in the photos, but has a yellowish off-white tinge instead.Was smaller than expected and lor was lighter shade of blue than indicated in the picture.This dress was good quality and a nice lor not quite as vibrant a blue as the photo, but still pretty but it was really large.Color faded fast but I still have some of them.The bottoms however faded after the first wash and are a really pale lor now.Does not look like the picture unless you are very tall.I purchased this item in mm Red Agate Jade and it is a different shade than what is pictured.Do not look like the picture.I bought it for a friend for her birthday because aquamarine is her birthstone however I had to really look close to see that there was a lor to this stone.Came in different pinkDoesn't quite look like the pictureIn the picture it looks like a more heather gray but it is actually a dark gray.Color not a pictured.Unfortunately, I was nfused by the lor.The pink lor was pretty, but it really is poor quality.The white one on the other hand definitely had some problems.Now the blue is unavailable, so I'm a little disappointed, but I'll get over it and pick another lor if they don't sell out again.So they won't stay on the black insert.Color isn't even close to what's pictured.The bra does not look like in the picture.It looks like a darker grey in the picture but what I received was a really really light silvery grey, which isn't what I wanted at all.Color is really paleIt is a off black lor however and not a solid black which kinda bums me out since I was planning on wearing it with a matching black skirt and it looks a little off.The shirt is very different from the photograph in that the smaller checks what appears as mostly grey in the photograph) are larger in person and there is very little difference between the left and right side of the shirt.Does not look like the picture makes it appear.I nsidered swapping for the white lor but am not inclined to incur anymore expense.Color of top was pretty, but something about sleeves just didn't lay right and top looked silly.the logo lors sort of faded.As cute as these are the green ones left a green stain on my ears.I'm just so disappointed with the green pair.Top is the rrect neon green lor and looks good but the straps are sewn on and I can't remove them, and the bottom is yellow and cut in a weird way that looks different from the other pictures for this item.However, strangely the bottoms of this blue and pink floral suit is too tight.My wife likes the lor and style very much, but it is very small.But the lor purple orchid) looks nothing like the picture shown.It's much much darker.All of them were great except for one of the dark gray ones which had big scratches on it.I do love the print and the lor, and I will keep it because it is not horrible and because it is shipped from China.The pink shades weren't my taste tho maybe another lor or shape This scarf would be lovely except that the Orange looks like a light, bright neon orange.This shirt runs extremely small and the print image is extremely faded.It looks just like the picture.Scales on bottom lost lor after only one swim.Sad the lor has dulled out on the bottom already.Color is mpletely wrong...looks mint or light green in the picture, is actually light blue, I needed light green for work so was very disappointed when realized.ordered xl not like the pictureNot quite like the picture.Also, after one wash the lor was different.I ordered two of these and the white one came with a uple missing buttons.Sadly, the black has a thick strange llar that the gray did not.Green came, the shoulder and bottom hem had rips.Also it is not green...teal or light turquoise would be the rrect term.Also, there's a weird black and orange star applique on the back of mine.All of the lors look much more faded then the ones shown in the picture.doesn't look anything like pictureI like it but I wanted the same lor as the picture but it came in purpleit's dark and dull.It's beige, it's not American sizes so be careful.The product is pictured as blue/aqua and it is actually a lime green.Also the lors are lame.The red lor dye was not fast, it bled in the laundry.Looks like picThe print is really cute.The lor is pretty good when in large quantities and the nsistency is great, but this is very pink once it thins a bit and the level of stainage on your skin is ridiculous.They have the engraved RB and the Ray-Ban in the rner but it says Ray-Ban P" instead so that's stupid but whatever.Got all these lors but the black was wrong size.The lors are bright and the designs are cute...but after one wash, one pair already has a hole along the seam.They do reflect a lot which is weird to look out ofThe glasses don't have as much blue as the picture.It looks lor and pattern) just like the photo.I am positive I order this shirt in white but when I got it, it was greyI need that lor for a suit or I would return it.Good value, great lors but unfortunately no good for me as they are way too small.Mine came opposite then pictured(reverse lors).The ad said these glasses were light brown but they are not, they are darker than the photo, much darker.Pretty design but the lor is misrepresented.It's a little hard to tell that the big magenta deration on the front is a spider.I do like it, the lor is fine I will keep it, however I am afraid to order the mustard one again since I have no idea if I will actually get that lor.was hard not able to pick the lor I wantedI ordered this top in Red...the package clearly states red however the shirt looks more orange.It does look just like the photo.It looked faded and almost pixelated.I ordered a beige lor and ended up getting a deep pink one... very disappointed.The advertised hat shows a bright blue with black area where the Mustang logo is.That hat is manufactured and provided by hotrodsplus.m and their website shows the lor of the hat that I actually received as a dark blue.I have no idea where they got the picture of the blue/black hat they use in their advertisement, but it should be changed to reflect what they really ship.Black lor is already fading.Though it did look different than the picture a bit.Very nfusing to put on, but cute.I got the white one and, it is HUGE gave starts because the picture makes the clear beads look blue and that is what I thought I would getThe unexpected part was that the jacket was NOT hooded in a traditional sense) and the jacket that arrived was grey, white and black...not grey, white, and blue like the photo.The blouse was not white as requested.I really like the lour I was skittle upset able the way the inside of the jacket.Colors are faded and the top was ittybitty and the bottoms were loose.It's more of a dark mint almost faded green.The lor shown in the picture is not the actual lor of the tie, at least to my eye.I uldn't wear it, and It wasn't like the picture.There are not any turquoise swags flowing loosely like in the picture.The picture shows green eyes but they are yellow.Also to note, the blue polka dot shirt does not have the black accents around the neck and sleeves as shown in the picture.Product was more of a greenish black lor in person and was slightly larger size then what I was expecting shirt looks slim fit in the picture and is not in person).There is only a strip of actual animal print.Colors really faded after one wash,,,,did not use bleach either.The lor does not go all the way around as expected.Wasn't crazy about lor.The ombre effect is pretty, but it'd be prettier if it were as lorful as depicted.The numbers you see on the image look like they're photoshopped.The lors are bright as shown in the picture but I'm a little surprised at the ratings, the bracelet is very small.However, the time" feathers are nfusing to me as there is an extra feather.His image is cute enough, just like in the picture.came as dark blue instead of blackCute top but the grey is much lighter than pictured and the tassel are wide cuts of fabric.I gave the set stars because the lors are a little off.It looks pink in the picture but it's not as dark.However, it does not glow in the dark.The black also had silver paint marks.I ordered this shirt because I already have one in yellow.The only thing I did not expect was unlike my yellow one, this one didn't me with a undershirt or a lining sewed into it.This is not ral however.... Its neon orange.The description says black but it looks more like gray.I ordered the matte pair.I ordered white and got grey.I am thinking of returning it it is really and ugly lorThe nude instead of black material was off but didn't have time to send back.I uldn't quite capture the pinkness" of the strap in my included photo- just imagine one more shade towards pink.Perhaps I received the wrong strap lor?Looked just like the picture.It it's actually black, not blue.Very cute, but the top was a different shade of red and green than the bottoms.The lors are great but the T-Shirts are of different sizes even though I ordered a T the shirts read T.However, product was not white in lor as described.If your short, like me, you might nsider buying the BFF.Other than that the print was clear and looked like the pictureNot a bad looking watch, but band is MUCH deeper pink than pictured.Print is faded.The dress was a smidge different in design than the photo showed, but it is still a pretty dress.Turns yellow after a short timeYou can't see that in the picture, but they do.Also light blue and green not the same thing.However, from the front, the lor of the stone isn't discernible.Ordered slate, got grey.In the photos, it appears to be dark blue with antique gold metal.Very pretty but wrong lor.I bought it in garishly bright orange, so I uld be seen on the street or on my bicycle.It's see through above the bust instead of how the photo of the model depicts it.But otherwise, it's a cute dress.It definitely doesn't look the same with the pper loring.Cute if added with other chains, by itself....not somuch.I returned it for a red one.Really does not look like the picture .I was bummed because I was happy with the lor, design and fabric.I ordered it in pink and got a ffee lour.... not mplaining too much.But I was disappointed when I didn't get the lour I wanted...I got my piece in red.The lour appears saturated and the picture makes it seem bigger than it is.I like the bag enough to keep it, but was disappointed that the bag is not red.Judging from the photo, I thought I was purchasing a red bag, but it is called Ginger' which is more of a gnac or burnt orange lor.Only disappointment is the lorThe lor in the product image does look like the shirt I received. of them broke, turned green, and i lost .It definitely does not look like the picture.Would have given stars if it looked just like the picture.In the picture it looks blue, but it's actually grey.Dark letters against a dark shirt... it's definitely hard to read.Overall, I do like the shirt.Otherwise cute dress.Didn't get all the variety of lors as shown of photo, which was disappointing.Other than that it looks like the picture.The picture shows them scrunched up, but they weren't all that scrunchable.Cute lors just runs really bigNot near as green as what was shown in the picture... almost black.It showed more lor in the picture than it really has, mine was mostly whitelook different than picture shows.i liked it but when i take it off and try to make the cross it was kind of hard to put back to the original look i might be doing it wrong lol other than that its very prettyNot as bright purple in person, very pretty sleeves thoughI had wanted the brown one and received the black one.Just doesn't look like thisMy whole picture turns pink.When i got this dress i was disappointed because the dress is really peach not pink.The grey came and was more of an olive lor.Red one is too loose.It's gray, not lavender....sad, but it will look ok with gray clothes.The shirt I got was the same lors but no arbor logo like the pic showed..It's the wrong lorThe black and blue are fine but the white hat came with a smudge on it.blurry image (The sweatshirt was ok. My son didn't like how big the flag was on it.Mine looks more purple than anything, and you really have to move the ring around to see any variations in lor.Deducting another star because both my grey and white socks are irreversibly stained by the brown softball infield dirt.Only thing was, when I washed it, all of the blue came offI like the lor and the print though.Smaller than the other lors available.I ordered two other lors and the red plaid was noticeably smaller.otherwise it's ol, a little different from the photo but still cute.The lor in the picture is super ugly.For the black I think i ordered the wrong size but it's cute.wrong lorHowever, it's closer to a burnt orange.The dress did have a spot on it black streaks approx long) when I received it; however, it did not appear used.The lors and graphics aren't too bad though, they look pretty ol.The arms are alot shorter and a different lor than pictured.The sleeves are tight and the picture is misleading.The top will work, but it's not bright white like the photo shows.The photo makes the three lors really pop.The reason I only gave them stars is the fact that they appeared to be in stock but then of the sizes I ordered shipped from China and were a different lor of green.The lor is as shown on the page and the quality appears average.The picture shows numbers on the watch face.Because of the lor issue, it's going back.The real one is not as pretty as on the picture.The blue shirts bled in the wash.I received my order today and was very disappointed that the bra that is advertised as being red is very clearly orange.I ordered black but you can still see through it....so wear a slip.Very cute print, and fits nicely, but was disappointed with the lor, the brown is an ugly brown.Cute top, but the blue is not royal blue as it appears in the photo.Nice print on rayon, but ordered an XLG and came as XXSML so had to pass it on to my little sister.It was okay, the lor started to wear off in about weeks but you get what you pay for.Not so in the wrong light.started to loose the silver lor after a while.Seller ship random lors so if you need the right lor go with a different seller.I'm happy with the length although it might be too long for some, but I ordered it in fuschia and it came in WAY brighter than that dusty pink lor that's shown.Shame, because I was looking for the lor shown in the picture.So now I have a black one and an almost white one.I painted my face instead.I will say, however, that they are definitely not truly polarized.Faded look.Product matches picture.It's cute but not as red as I'd like it to be- more pink lorThe grey advertised on the picture isn't accurate; the hat came in and it's more dark, like a charal, than a middle-of-the-road gray.The yellow was a bit faded.Knocked off a star because the heather hunter green just looks gray, does not look olive or greenish at all like in the picture.Went with the rral lor instead.Color fades quickly but cute.Unfortunately the green is much more vibrant in real life than in the photo, which was a disappointment as I bought them for splay reasons.The reason I am giving it stars is because the actual look of the sweater is much whiter than it appears in the picture.It is not as gray in tone as it looks to be.Ordered the green and the black, they are both going back.The skirt part of the stume got mislored as a result.I ordered this with the imression it was PINK and black when I clicked black.Nice lors and material just ran smallthe golden buttons and blue ones weren't there lolThe green lor was somewhat strange.Pattern looked totally different than picture so that made it look funny when wearing, didn't look like picture but fit.They are pretty much opaque white.He has a pretty significant lor problem with red/green.My only qualm is the lor.I ordered in white and when wearing it you can noticeably tell you pants are unbuttoned because the lor is rather see-through.You mite want to look elsewhere.I bought them for balance issues and will have to buy a different brand now.I wanted it to look like the model in the picture.I ordered a black pair but I ended up getting a red pair instead, which made me disappointed, but it's whatever cause it still looks nice.ordered white but arrived dirty lor white.They seem to be polarized as stated and they definitely reduce glare.Add says black in lor but I think it's more of a charal grayish.Mine didn't look like the picture.Ordered a small in white had a little small brown stain on bottkm outer lining.. will need to wash.The lor is not the same as advertised but it's still a cute bag.The logo in the front seemed as if it was worn and had a bunch of white marks like deodorant.To top it off, I didn't even get the right lor.I ordered the blue/black white dress but ended up receiving the Purple/Black White one.The lor is beautiful, the stitching where the sequins are on the bust came back a little ripped but its okay.The silhouette isn't like the picture.The black lor of the car looks purple.necklace turned my neck green in two days.The jeans are almost white, not pink as they look on the picture published on the internet.I'll keep it, although the top doesn't look quite like the photo but then, neither do I).The lor was also a bit closer to navy then the bright blue in the picture.Even though I was expecting a burgundy it sort of seems like a bright red to me.She sent me a picture and it was so different than the picture here.Much much lighter shade of red' you uld probably call it vermilion or brick or ral or a shade somewhere thereI had been buying these in black from another seller and decided to give lor a try.Had a hard time finding a dark brown palazzo pants so I'll keep themI ordered lor the lavender/pale purple) and it's actually closer to a darker pink/mauve photo attached).Top of sock should be black.When it arrived I was disappointed because the shirt was more of a lighter lime green lor rather than the rich bold green I expected.It turns out darker than the picture.The lor and quality are OK but it's just way too big.More of a goldenrod lor than yellow, but otherwise cute socks.It wasn't as slouchy as I was expecting, and the item I received was not the magenta lor pictured.Cute hat, but the lor of the linen was much more peachy than it appeared in the picture.wrong lor, nice fabric.I was looking for a lighter pink, more of a midweight pullover, and it was a bit tight for me.Under some lighting these can look very orange.It was very obvious that I was wearing it, even with a black shirt.The black ones are a disappointment, they pill too much.Not like the picture, there is a lot of black in itIt doesn't glow blue either.I love the vibrant lors but when it stretches such as over my chest...) you can see vertical white lines so that the print gets distorted.The purple is more of a wine red and the stripes are black, although I thought them to be brown.The dress looks just like the picture.Colors differ from the pictureIt's a see through shirt, doesn't look like the picture.And that would be okay but it's so short too and it makes me feel unmfortable.Made my fingers green.I ordered this one and the blue- the only mplaint is the pink one does NOT look like the one in the picture.First of all, it actually came as a bright clown red lor when the picture makes it look a burgundy or maroon lor.The picture is literally so differentMy bag is not a bright clear blue but more of a drab blue which is a bit of a disappointment.Does not look like what I thought t would look like.When they're dark they look great, with light lors unfortunately you can see everything.It's pretty cute and mostly appears as it does in the picture, except the sleeves aren't exactly the same.Color was not what it looked like it.This shirt has a brighter lor than the picture...the shoulder width is / inches and the material stretches to about - inches more After only or wearings of each lor I got grey and black) they both started to develop holes in different places.Looks just like the photo.I expected it to look just like the picture and it didn't.Pretty loring and design that matched product picture and description.That's another thing it might look gray but it's definitely more purple than gray.Looks like rose gold instead of yellow(Also, buttons are black with the blue dress, not blue like the photo) It's also VERY sheer; you definitely need to wear a slip under this dress.It's cute, although the black print on the purple shirt is way too dark and difficult to see.The print is not as vibrant on the front to really distinguish it as a jedi' design.it is bigger than the pictureWish I uld find Malibu at another store, too bad it's not the exact same lor as turquoise.I like it in the picture but it doesn't look like that on me.NOT AS IN THE PICTURE.More of a yellow green than the picture shows.I think I will ntinue to wear them.I also like that it's not see through for a mostly white shirt.I ordered similar in blue that was perfect in xl Disappointed with this oneOrdered a purple one just like it for my daughter and it kept her face and head warm and dry.Red was not as pictured so I was definitely disappointed.The photo makes it appear to bright read.It was a pretty lor, but it just fit strange, and if your tall, its not going to work as a dressI literally own almost every Pattyboutik item, in at least one lor.definitely does not look like the pic.If it was red on red I would give it five starsReceived the wrong lorI'm a little disappointed because the package I got was different lors than this photo.I know it's stume but still the same when you get it you expect it to look like it does in the picture.But for all you short girls out their, buy this dressVans are always mfy, if you haven't tried the brand give it a go.I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE COLOR IT IS A VANILLA OR OFF WHITE THAN WHITE.A bit faded of a print, but what can you do for this band?The green ones leave a green lor on my lobes, not a big deal bit kind of ncerning.Although, the female pictured wearing these, hers looked much more rose gold rather than pink.. Unfortunatly, in person, they are much more pink than I expected.Lighter than I thought it would be.The suede tends to look dirty as if there's dust/dirt ated over them.They're a dusty black lor, in other words.It doesn't look like the photo amazon has.The pink is a light neon, it's a thinner and stretchier material than what it appears in the photo, and the grays aren't as dark.The Strap is not black it is brown.My only reason for not giving stars was that I ordered and where the wrong lor.And it does look like the pictureThe black ones I ordered always llect dog hair and fuzz and are getting nubby/rough where my thighs rub together.print is blurryIt's a win but maybe I'll look for another lor.(The brown is too much on the purplish side didn't match any of my brown pants so I went for the black Tie Dyed to be on the safe side.I ordered the light purple and the lor was just like the picture showed.Others had stated theirs was almost pink.Only mplaint is lor is VERY different than picture.The lor is hard to wear some thing with it but jeans.I like these except the flare at the bottom.Also, shoes not as black as they appear in photo.I'm " and it's not as short as shown in the picture.I did not keep them, the design was clunky and they were sent in wrong lor.Yes I received a green, Choromatsu, hoodie, but instead of being a very olive lor, it came out to be a neon green, almost borderline yellow.The purple one is slightly lighter in lor but I actually like it.Looks just like photo.Cutouts in the back are cute.Very cute, looks just like the pictures.Pocket and bow is black not blue which is slightly a bummer.Hasn't faded or affected my skin in any way.The silver lor on the beads is fading which is why I give this anklet stars instead of .I only see product in pink.Also I will note that the lor brown" is inaccurate.There is no brown in this whatsoever.I like butterflies so I bought of these they are thin and very pretty lors.No issues with the others falling apart, just the brown argyle one.My only problem was when I washed it, acrding to the tag, I added in one of those lor absorbing clothes and the maroon bleed out onto the white and turned it pinkI will still wear it but super bummed it didn't stay whiteI liked the lors and the style, but it looked a little too cheap for, so I returned it.It says red but in person it's dark pink.If it's not bright enough it may hurt your eyes to have them idjus to the ntrastING lors.cute but very faded.No one else at the pool has this pattern, winI chose the black lor and it uld easily work for both men and women.Its very gray and shortits nice, its not red tho more like ral and when I go to a different light setting it looks hot pink lolI took a picture to show someone the earrings an in the photo I can see a tint of green.They're pretty even though I don't see any tint of green.It did not take long for the ver lor to start going off.nice but label is in an odd locationThis is a repeat order in a different lor.But it came with a black smudge on the front.I love the rose gold lor, and minimalist style, but the font was different more manly style)than the original picture, and slightly off center.Nice shirt, but I wish the print ntinued to the back.Nice lor but the bow was sown on awkwardly.The red lor is actually bright red like I was hopingIt is a darker yellow than I expected but actually blends in with his shirt.It is clearly a bright electric blue not even remotely purple so do not think when the seller says blue that you are getting anything other than thatIts very cute, but the lor is darker in person its bigger then I expected.So if you are looking for Black and White only then I would say don't by this dress.Be careful with the white one thoThis tie was the perfect lor however I miss read.. its SKINNY like maybe two inches skinny tie.Look different in person than what's pictured.Even my own pictures don't do the lor justice.The lour is a rich red brown, darker then the photo but well described in the product description, I found the lour didn't match my shoes so that was disappointing.Print just as pictured.However, its actually a matte rose gold frame with partially matte lens with a horizontal pink mirror section in the center of the lens.However, they are not as yellow as pictured.Like the lors looks like the picture.Dark green was a little more brown than expected and it made me look slightly bigger than I had hoped, but thats not too big of a deal.The dress pattern is really pretty in person.The padding in the black one was normally shaped.It really is close to the hue of the pink dress shown.)Unless you zoom in, you don't notice that.Also got it in black, not as noticeable but still pretty ineffective bra in that sense.Looks like the photo.The black shirt was a more tight fit than the grey.I had ordered the unisex black M ones first and they were huge and then the white M women's and I am keeping them but still on the big side and I have big hands.I am the hospital had the L sent directly to me in hospital XL was sent to my home.the lors are duller than the picture of amazonReally cute, great lors, a big smallThis top is cute, beautiful lorful yellow but for a much smaller person then me.I got Pattern , the first one.More so like the other pictures featured.It was the black n white ones with the elephant.They look like the real things Hasn't turned lors and doesn't bother me laying on my stomach.Same as the picture.I was expecting a white background because that's how it looks on my mputer, but it's way more of a yellowish cream see my photos).I was hoping to wear it with white capris but the shade is too off, so I'll wear it with navy capris or jeans.The bag I received it in even said dark blue" it's more of a baby blue though.It's a cute shirt and I like the light blue lor.It did not me in the little black keepsake bag as displayed in the pictures above.I was hoping to order a bunch of these in different lors, but all I can say is these are cheaply made and I feel disappointed.Something totally different, but in the photo it shows blue flowers mine is purple no big deal I love the front backLOVE THE COLOR LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE.It's appears to look light brown in the picture, but it's actually a burnt orange.The lor is pretty close to olive, maybe a little on the yellow side of it.I have of these shirts in different lors and bought the red one to wear over Christmas.However, I ordered the brown and they almost look black because they're so dark.Very cute, but the picture makes it appear red, but I got a hot pink one.Also it is a pretty medium blue.The Silver part is darker than the picture and also has a gasoline-like lor to it, but thats only noticeable when you look close.I purchased the green one and it's almost identical to the picture.I thought it was blue as pictured but I received a green one.Color is beautiful runs a little bigHowever, it's not pink as the picture described.Color as pictured.I ordered the Khaki" and it looks like the Army Green" - including the pad.I do not have time to return it for the rrect lor, I need it here to take on vacation next week.I got the white one and one of the wings is turned upside down from the other one so it looks kinda weird.The white was more creme lored and is very see thru so must be wore under longer tops.I did notice on the black one that the front seem was crooked.The stars aren't the lor of blue I thought they looked like in the picture, but still pretty earrings.Just like the picture.Not quite as bright neon green as I expected but still cuteIt turned my wrist dark where it rubbed.The lor has not faded nor has the bow warped.I took of one star because I was missing one of the lors.It's getting stars because in the picture the red looks darker, but it's a bright red.The reason they get stars from me is because they arrived scratched.Beautifully made and gorgeous lor, but WAY too small.Based on the reviews, I thought that the brown dress was going to be maroon.Either I misunderstood, or they fixed the lor.The dress I got is like a brownish rust lor.I would order more, but the other lors do not me in my size.i ordered the wrong size but same as pictureif it bemes available in BLUE again i would buy an other one.Both XL's but the dusty blue was smaller for some reason.Also love the lor it's not too shabbyDress print itself super cuteHowever, there was a yellow marker stain on the black part in the back.When I went to clean it off, it seemed never ending and bled into the white so now some of the White is stained yellow.If you want to look at all...fashionable?It's a little darker than the photo, it looks more like a grayed denim.I bought this dress intending to wear it to the beach but was nervous being a tye dye design that it wouldn't look like the picture.On my iPad the lor looked like a pretty purple lor.However it's very much a hot pink lor.I got both the grey and yellow.I needed mint green running pants to wear as part of a running stume.This is slightly larger than I expected and it isn't yellow like the picture at all; more like a light lime yellow.I was not a fan of the white sides, so decided to try making them black.I really pushed hard on the marker to get the black in around the straps.I also have these in tan, and am debating whether to make the sides brown or leave them white -)(Sorry if images are unclear or sideways.)Instead of the butterfly one, I got the round faced watch with a leaf.The lor does not look like the burgundy in the picture at all, but rather like some faded pastel version of it.The purse is black and blue whereas the wallet is brown.The only reason I gave stars instead of is because I uld have purchase it for half the price as this is a disntinued lor/pattern but I needed it in a hurry and the store would have taken longer to ship.They look just as they do in the picture.I think they sent me the suit in the wrong lor, but it's still cute.We ended up dying it by using rit dyemore to get it to more of a navy blue.it's says the lor varies.Color was not as dark as pictured.Looks like the pic.We still used both for my wedding but the different lors made me give this product stars instead of .I was a little disappointed that the lors weren't as vibrant as shown in the pictures.They also lose the silver lor soon and turn bronze lor.Ill be buying another lorI know some variation in lor is to be expected- however I just wish there was some of the bright yellow in the front of the dress there's a small bit in the back).It was a bit darker than what was in the picture.I want to buy a black one nowIt's cute and looks like the picture.The one I tried on was a medium, black in lor and was to big for my " waist.Although the lor does not change on how cute it looks drastically.They pants are a little weird, almost like the blue lor was painted on.... or something.Maybe it's because it's white.Chose the red and I'm not disappointedSome patterns look like they were enlarged too much and me off looking blurry while others look great.Colors were not exactly what I expected; although I was a bit disappointed with the lors, I kept it.Colors bled a little in the wash.i'd buy another or two if they had more lors a man asks his waitress for ffee, no cream.. she says she's sorry, they are out of cream, would he like some with no milk?Just as bright red as it looks.A bit more off white than the brown i was expecting.My daughter said it's too blood red for her but I like the lor.The only mplaint that I have is that it is NOT black.Fit as expected, bought along with a navy lour which fit horribly so happy with this one.It looked just like the picture.My mplaint is, because I'm very particular and will examine every stitching and line, this capris is slightly a lighter lor than the one I have and they're supposedly both lightning blue.The grey shirt is actually a very light grey and does not look like the picture at all.Thought the star was green however was blue.The flowers are almost a blue gray and found blue-gray with black panties at another store.The lor is actually darkerHowever, there is no green as it looks like in the picture.They should be washed before wearing them b/c the lors bleed.They use to be white.Logo was kinda faded?It arrives in a large brown amazon box...it does not have its own brand/packaging.Button fell off as soon as I took them out of the bag, lor is different than I expected gray instead of White) so it doesn't match my shirt or hat but I'll keep them anyway.The material not as good, and the lor faded after play at beach just one dayThese say wine, but they're a very dark red.Dress looks just like picture.However the send time I bought them, they sent the wrong print.(It may look a little purplish-blue in my photos, but in person, it really is true to the lor shown in the stock photo.Thought it was matte black from the picture though.T he only difference so far are the watchbands: one's blue, one's black.It doesn't even have to have words--just a simple diagram will do.Other than that it looks just like on picture.looks just like photoIt displayed the shirt a darker blue than it actually is, it appeared more as a Navy blue but was actually a Royal blue.The print is very cute.other that it was just like the photoThis shirt is true to lor and picture but runs large.Would have given it stars but lors were much duller in personI bought the green shorts and they look just like the picture.Doesn't look like it does in the picture.But I'm super pleased to say that these pants are Seriously Purple.I received the wrong lor item and it was to close to Xmas to get it exchanged for the right one.wouldn't order if you are over 'ish... unless you wish to wear as shirt.It is just like the picture.The blue and the black are fine, but the pink and green are very washed out and look old and worn.I LOOK FARWARD WEARING IT TO SEE IF THE COLOR WILL NOT CHANGE.Look just like the picture.The lors are different than what is shown in the picture.I was a bit disappointed because t isn't black and white it's more of an off white/pale stained yellow and white.I ordered grey but got a cream lored but still cute )I dropped a star because in the photo the hat looks more like a light blue/light turquoise.The seller does state there is a lor variation due to monitors but this is a huge variation.The photo has some filter on it to make the lors pop which has altered the base lor of the hat in the photo.The lor appears the same on my Chromebook and Galaxy S Edge Plus so I know it's not my monitor altering the lor.The print is brighter than the picture.Very long, the yellow is like a mustard yellow, extremely delicate material.I thought it was SS guess I should read all the fine print lolI bought this dress in burgundy, it came out red.The red is a little lighter than pictured.I got the what I thought was suppose to be beige and it is white and sorta see-through on top.Unless that's the look your after, it may not be the gown for you.But in a different lor.looks just like the picture.The lour look some how washedA classy tunic that can be dressed up with scarf leopard or other beige/black print) if you like to mix patterns.So I had to use spray lor to ver those spots that still showed.I don't have pictures of The pants but I had them on in this picture.Although they were slightly more translucent and the lor for some were off, they are great.It looks just like pictureMy only mplaint is I've lost a uple O rings already, and the pink pair in the picture is actually white.The tent is darker then the pictureHowever the lor shown here is not the same as arrived it more orange then the musty lor on the sight it threw me off but I deciced to keep it anyway.But the dress looked a little different than what the advertisement shows and the lor was off...I ordered burgundy but the dress lor was more like a candy apple red.The one disappointment is that I purchased it in white and was expecting to receive a white sash but a yellow one was sent instead.The green in reality is slightly lighter, just slightly.- but different than shown.The pink is much brighter than it looks in the product picture, but I actually like itArrived in a different lor than the one I chose.The lor is also slightly off mine is just a little darker than pictured).that's why i docked a star, but that just me.I was % dissapointed its not white white it has like % pearl in it but its ok i guess.However it says that it is pink and I think that it is ORANGE not pink...I sent it back and kept the black one which I really like and wore to play tennis in today....Unfortunately they did not have the black available on Amazon Prime so I ordered a green and have been very happy with the purchase and sizing.doesn't look at all like pic but still niceOnly mplaint is that the stone is not as dark as in the pictureHe loves them but it came with a scratch across the back of the black one.I like it but I find the lettering to be very faint.One is yellow and one is white but that is not a deal breaker.My only disappointment is I ordered IVORY and the dress is labeled ivory, however the dress is pure white.The black lenses give a bluish tint when looking through them some lenses brands/types filter yellow, or grey).The COLOR is NOTHING like this picture though.tie didn't me in the pink and black stripe i wantedI still like it and do plan to purchase another in a different lor.Still, they look real.Cute sweater and lors are true to the hue, but the material is a bit cheap.It came a day early but it looks really dark almost a black unless you show it in light then it's a very dark purple, it also doesn't me with a chain.Also, black came off small bottom part of one of the earrings, so I took a black sharpie and lored it in.Cute, much much brighter orange though.But in other lights we thought it black.We actually wound up using the suspenders but then used a different bowtie which was more lorful and actually had green, black and blue in itThe first one was cream and was great but ripped so I ordered a black one and ordered it a size up the first one rolled down).The only reason that I did not give this product stars is because the yellow portion of the dress does not go down as far as the picture on me.I only gave this stars because of the misrepresented lor description.The lor is called red but it looks more like ral online.If the button was not broken I would have given it five stars.Good variety of lors and super cheap.My only mplaints is when she first wore it that everything was black.The lor is not as yellow as I thought it would be, the material is pretty thin.It' not black as the photo, which is disappointing.May look ok from yds away or in the dark.It looks like many other bracelets, but it gets a turquoise look across.The crimson is definitely crimson not a bright red as shown.Minus star because it is way overpriced for what you're getting.The red is a little dull.The gray one didn't ship from Amazon so it took longer but there were some physical differences mpared to the ones that came in the two pack.Lose the lor when stick it selfIt looks brown in the picture.The description does say that the band is BLACK.The lor is as pictured.These are much redder than they appear in the picture, more like a cherry red.The pattern is very pretty, but the lors are more muted than shown.The blue/orange one just ripped off the first day that he puts it on, but the other one is good so far.It is a pale pink, not much different from the picture.It's not as cute as it seems on the pictureThe purple one was actually larger than the black.I kept the black and gave her purple.I ordered this at thinking it was grey sleeves and white drawstrings but actually received a at with white sleeves so I'm a little nfused.I like that it is brown and black so I can wear either lor boots or purses with it.It is a much darker gray than it appears in the picture.red faded.The picture online also makes it look like the bottom of the dress is a dark pink.The only thing is that lose the lor easily.it changes lor after uple weeksColor is a little lighter than the picture, but still a pretty red.I like the watch, except the hands should have been black.white on white is hard to see.Hopefully the protector I ordered will get here before I lose even more lor.I usually buy only white briefs, these me in differant lors and I like the lors.They were great except that the black one had a line of holes down the back.Not bad darker than the pic thoMy only criticism is that I got the red version, and they are not real red, a bit on the orange side of red.The tint of the glasses were really over powering and made everything really orange-y, sepia lored.I may buy another lor unless I can find something longer.We had to spend over to have the dress altered.Dark brown that I received is not as dark as in photo.Colors have not faded after washing and it held its shape without shrinking.It scrathes easy but really, that's to be expected with metal, especially seen with black.The only reason I gave them stars is because the picture is a bit deceiving on the lor.The lors are very light, and in a uple pairs u can barely see what lor its supposed to be once it's in ur ear.It changed lor in just week.The lors are way too opaqueThe flower is a different lor than the dress i may just find another flower to replace it withDidn't realize half of the shoe was a different lor but i am starting to like it.However, the picture is somewhat misleading.The ones I bought were the blue mirror/grey ones and they'll probably stay in my car since they're ARE polarized.Otherwise I like the lookI was a little disappointed though because mine had a little black mark on one of the white parts.Very cute true to lor runs a little smallIt was a bit misleading in the picture in that sense as you obviously assume both with show.More off white and a little thin, but the print is pretty for the price.But are much darker than pictures.I wouldn't so much call them smoky rather than purple.Just much darker than what I wanted.I give this jacket out of stars because the lor is a bit odd.There is a purple cast to the picture, though, that is not really what I expected and is why I rate with only stars.Color is as picturedIt was really just a matter of choosing which lour to get.I was sad, because I loved the way it looked, but I had to return it.I would not be surprised if in a few washed the lettering starts to me off.The lor was on point and the size was tooThe lor is more reddish in person and I would like for it to have me with more holes I had to poke two extra holes in in since I bought it as my stomach shrank a bit).I would even purchase another if they offered it in more lours, or without fringe.Much darker maroon/burgundy than it appears in the picture.Have washed it a few times and it hasn't shrunk or lost lor.The dress did run a bit smaller for the navy blue one.I've washed it a few times and I can't really tell if it's really dark blue or black.Also, the blue is different than the one shown in the picture, mine is more of a darker blue than the one shown.I wear the black one A LOT....and the other beigy-gold when I wear something of that shade.I ordered it monogrammed but it did not me with it on the shirt.Ordered in black and I think white would not look good because of weird double layer in front of garment Although there is lor to the ring, it seems to look more silver from far away instead of multilor.I thought it looked orange and it is.I am going to reorder in a different lor.Color was a little different than photo.Honestly does not look like the picture at all.I would describe the yellow as more gold.I ordered Red but got Salmon so I took away a starLooks like the images shown.The gold is a snake which is not my usual style, but unless you look closely, it just looks like pretty gold.I'm sure it's supposed to be off-white, but it looks almost yellow.I was hoping for the one pictured but I got the nude with black piping this is not pictured on the website.It was not pixelated, faded, or blurry.I like this dress as it looks just like the picture.I ordered a gray one and a navy one came, but I decided that I would just keep the navy oneMy only mplaint is that the lor was a bit off.I like the product a lot, just wish it came in more lors than back and white.It's my fault it says off white and its really off white.Hasn't turned green or anything.Colors are a bit faded.I loved the lor, a neutral beige, but, unfortunately, I have to send it back.The actual lor seems a little more light and little more warm...which I am not mplaining about.The pants are very long, but the print is super cute.Is identical to picture.One problem they give a little camel toe I'd suggest a size up and don't get the bright lors they suck.the brown side is much darker than it looks in the photos, so much so that it's barely discernible from the black side.I got fusia lor and it is beutiful.I ordered the small in white.I bought the purple and beige and for some reason the beige is tighter.Wanted a black one, but there was none, a pretty red though.This pair came with a very distracting scratch in the left lense.I like it a lot, the only bad thing is how easily it turns my finger green.Other women ask me at the gym where I got it now I see other women with the same type but different lour.Only negative about the shirt is the blue sleeve.It's not the right lor, almost looks green.The black ones are sick wit it white are aight, clear ones are wack.I had to return the purple one though, since it had loose threads in the middle of stitches.I re-ordered the purple bag and the send one came with a ripped handle.Might buy again, still undecided.Much yellower than expected.Then I ordered the black one with the same size.When I mpared them side by side, it's obvious that the black one is smaller than the blue one even though they're both a size .I like them but the photo shows them dark as I wanted.The stains" are blackish/grayish lor and they are on the front and back of the dress.I was shocked by the lor that cameDoesn't look at all like the willow lor displayed but appears black which I did NOT want to go with Khaki lored Northface pants.I was sent the inrrect lor, which was very quickly and hassle free refunded.They appear just like the picture indicates.The black, burgundy, and gray ones are way tighter than the ral and are a little scratchier on the edges between legs.Pretty decent print.THE OTHER CAME A WEEK LATER AND IT'S A DARK MYSTIFYING PURPLELooks exactly like pictures however with the black the inside has cheetah print instead of plain lor.Look like s but that is what son wantedThe only thing I would change would be darker lens.Wanted red/orange but got two shades of pink.Only disappointment was I thought I would be receiving a blue hair tie as was advertisd in photo aide but instead got a red and black one.Seems it's random lors.The photo does make the bibs appear a little bit brighter in lor than they seemed in person, but I didn't mind that so much.However, the bibs with red are more orangey in lor than I expected.But lor and style looked just like the pic.I ordered the gray large shirt.The lor and if you notice it does huge the model's torso.The only reason why it is missing a star is because it seemed as if the lor faded after a uple of washes.The lor is definitely pretty and not different from the picture.Not my usual style but decided to give these a try and they are really cuteThe only reason I didn't give them five stars was that they were a total different lor than the ones shown.:) The pink/peach lor looks just like in the photo, but when the pants are on the stretched fabric makes the lor look less vibrant.And despite being very dark grey they are still slightly see through.VERY see-through though so if you get white you will definitely need to wear a tank underneath.Not crazy about the yellow tint but they do work on cutting out the glare.it looks just like the photos.While this hat is cute, the lours did not match those in the picture.I wish I had ordered black or grey instead of the navy blue, it's just a different shade of blue than what I expected.Cute patterns although the dinosaurs are much larger and blurred IRL.Otherwise it was a cute shirt and I would order it again.Spent the day at the park and left without pink checks.The lors are a bit deceiving.The chain is black.I thought the pics made it look like it is black and red.the lor is a little different.It appears to be a deep black ating, little specks of blue show up inside occasionally.Is very pretty and looks just like shown in the picture.The only thing I'm deducting a star for is the lor is darker pink than what the picture showsI don't know if the included lavender sachet is meant to ver up the smell?I was so dissipointed I returned them.Just a little thin on the black area.My only mplaint is that the green I orders is much darker than the photo, it's almost a forest green.The pattern is also just as depicted.The picture mad it look more clear see throughThe background is dark like picture shows.The lor is bright, and the print are identical to the picture.Doesn't stain...so far but lets see how that last but overall it's cute.I got the red but it is more like a red-orange.It is cute but I was hoping for more a tourqouise like the picture but it is more baby blue.Otherwise I would have gave stars.Which is fine, except I thought they'd look more like the picture on me.I thought it was black/white striped.I worried about the bottom when I first wore it.The only mplaint I have, was there was a purple line on the dress when I received it.The top is very cute, however the lor is different that what is pictured.It is blue, but the blue in the image appears to have a shimmery or silver tinged, the actual shirt is a bit brighter.The lor is slightly darker than I thought it would be.Unfortunately the lor of the print became less vivid as my healthy hips and thunder thighs stretched the material, which leads me to think I might should have ordered a large instead of a medium.A little brighter red then the pictures look too.Also, the cats on the front of the jacket have orange whiskers and orange highlights on them but the cats onthe back do not which makes for kind of a strange look.Only issue was they sent half of them in the wrong shade of grey.Nice lors pink ribbon is a little smaller than I imaginedThey look just they way it looks on the image, so the purple one isn't pastel if you're looking into getting a pastel chokerMuch darker gray than shown in the picture.The dye isn't set.I pulled it out of the bag to check it out and my finger tips turned blue.I was a little disappointed as I thought the flowers were a pale pink and they ended up being beige.I bought an assortment here on Amazon actually that can in white and yellow gold in several sizes.The actual shirt I received is a John Lennon shirt.Was surprise by the lor, choose a bloody orange got it fluo orange, that's my only problem.My only mplaint is that the white" stripes are actually off-white, so when I put it over a white tank top it looks odd.I really like the look and feel of these.I ordered dark grey and received an army green one I'm not sure if that is their version of grey or if I was sent the wrong lor I don't see such a lor listed as an option).I purchased black and navy blue acrding to the nfusing) chart.The lors are a little different from the shirt we bought at Disneyworld last year, but Disney might have changed the design.The only mplaint i have, another reviewer mentioned this; the taupe/beige" lor i ordered turned out to be a weird light purple-ish lor.How do you misplace socks this lorful???It's also from a different . lor story.I did receive the wrong lor....Not matte at alllor is a little less vibrant than the pictures showI ended up receiving black pairs.Still haven't used the needles so, I can't say if they seem good or not.The lor and make is as described but am disappointed with the size.I was under the impression that I was getting the lors in the picture, but I'm not too upset about that.Colors look like in the picture, so no issue there.Color seems lighter than the picture shows, however.The lors are bright and vibrant, no sign of cheap ink bleeding or fading.It was a little deeper shade then it appeared in picturesI did order the wrong lor but it wasn't a big deal and I just kept it.The time is hard to see due to it being black.Saw a friend who has same bag in purple and decided to give it a try.The swimsuit is very cute, overall.The only reason that I did not give it stars is that the yellow is significantly darker than in the picture.If you are looking for a butter yellow, you will be disappointed.It's a pretty lor I got the turquoise) but it does get dirty easily.They looked just like the picture.I got it in black.Beautiful bag but they gave me the wrong lor that was not in their description.I wanted brown but they gave me pink.Loses lor in the dirt, but that's to be expectedChain lor changed after first wear.The lenses are very dark, but not too dark.Sendly, it's not apparent from the photo in the description, but the lenses are not a uniform lor at all.I can never get the tie to look like the pic thoughThe lors are vivid and really pop next to her burgundy and black uniform.The lors are fun but a bit impractical.The black is not see through.To be fair, the lor is exactly how it appears in the photos, it is just too orange/red looking for me and I think it makes it look cheap.Color was lighter in person than what's shown on siteGot what I expected except the lor was off due to prior bleaching of tee shirtJust like pictureThe lor of this one is not what I would call Navy.The lor is more of a dull and mutes than navy, more of a grey blue.The lor was just as pictured.Darker in lor than the pictureThe pattern on the skirt I received is different from what's pictured but I'm not mplaining as I am pleased with the lor and design.The lors are also a lot darker than the picture on amazon.Since i got the striped one, you can kind of see the stripes under neath the head.Like, way bright.It is short as seen in the photo.Like the lor, I'm attempting to get away from the usual black, blue, brown and dark grey lor Sceme, men's fashion police have enforced upon the male sex.uld be a littel darkerThis thing's bright red.Love the lor, but the fabric of this dress was entirely different than the fabric of the same dress and same seller in a different lor.i liked it but it was the wrong lor.was not black.No actual lightupWithin a uple weeks, the green had faded to white.Also the photos on line with the description created some nfusion when choosing.I got the pink shirt, but the lor doesn't look quite like the picture; it's more orange-pink.My fianc ordered the same pair from his Amazon acunt and we ended up with two pairs of these green ones.Looks just like the photoThe lor doesnt run when your arm gets sweaty.Great lours but none came with earring backs...The print looks just like the photoThe white stripes are burn-out, the black is terrycloth.Could be darker.The only issue with it is that the egg patterns are a little more faded than what is shown in the picture.Came as more of a highlighter orange but still super cuteThe lor was slightly off.Pics are slightly distorted and unclear.Its slightly see through if your ander garments are a dark lor.Other then that, looks just like the picture.I like it Color and look the same like picture.It's cute and I like the lors....The sizing is not anyway near what it says it is.I was looking for undershirts for my navy uniform, these aren't quite the right lor and they are a little short.It's the same pattern, just flipped.It looks like it does in the picture.It's pretty much like the photo.And the yellow batman logos are see through in some areas.Very cute, looked just like the pictures.The lenses are darker than they appear in the picture.The only problem I had with it is that I ordered Ivory the dress looks very WHITE to me.The bill almost looks black in the pictures, but it's actually navy.A lot of people don't like the lor, but since I am probably) slightly blue-green lorblind some green shades appear blue to me) my rating isn't judged by it.To me the stars appear blue and so do the dots but with maybe the teenyest hint of green, but don't trust me on that since I might see it wrong.The one I ordered was supposed to be blue but the one I received was black.If I uld get them in black I would.I would have given stars, but due to just a little bit of misadvertising, I was led to believe that the product with the pink opal was a white gold'.After a monty or so of wearing it turns brown and ugly but it was worth the price.The mesh is a lighter lor and slightly less transparent than it appears in the photo.I deducted a star because the bottom is low rise, not Brazilian" high cut like the photo.The lor seems different then shown tho.Looks more purple then blue.The the bottom is sort of a clear brown.Also the material is see through in yellow The lor was as pictured.I used the sizing chart in the pictures and ended up ordering a medium in Ivory.Looks just like the pictureLook like the picture.The only downfall is that the lor bleeds.Would have given stars if I knew it was purple not blue.The purple looks more pink though.WARNING ***The Red is NOT Red.Very different from the photo.This hat is adorable and is a dark purple not the more pink lor displayed, this hat is also about half as full as pictured.My only tiny* mplaint is that the white one is decently sheer.It's big, it's solid, and it's even more lorful than the picture.Like, there's a gathered cuff weird.. EDIT to add: Ok, I've actually worn the shirt out now and I like it a little better than my first impression.Ordered blue, wasn't as bright as the image.I love these cubes but I was disappointed in the lor purple that these were.I would give stars if I would have received the right lor, the lor/pattern I received was not even one of the options.The description says beige but the picture shows something that is pretty white to my eyes.Maybe its me or my mputer but I was expecting an off-whiteish lor.The lors are dramatically differing from the photo images.The look just like the photojust like the photo.I have the same pair in a different lor and really like them.I like the lor and material of these shorts, but I'm undecided about the style.You can see this in the picture.Cute dress, wrong lor for my daughter.Looks more like ral instead of orange but i like it.Just as they appear in the picture.I ordered and I love it, however I thought it was white with the print.. Its light blue and the print is mpletely different.Has also black rynstonesAlso the horizontal stripes are really slimming and adorable.I like the fact that the heart opens and you can change out the glowing bead for either a pearl or something else.Was dark enough to look black, but really liked itBut other wise it looks just like the picture to me.I was always disappointed that they didn't me in more lors until I stumbled across theseNow that I know these glasses exist in more lors, I will be ordering another pair in the black and smoke.Thankfully I have a tie bar that's this lor.Love love love them so much may get another pair of different lor and desingIt looks just like the photoI wish the lining was My Little Pony themed, instead of Iron Fist's logo stamped all over in black and white though.but the lor almost looks like a faded black already.My only mplaint was that the yellow lor was a bit awkwardly sheer/ see-through.But I exchanged it for one of the darker lors and no problem.Will match almost any lor.Cute purse but lor said lilac-and pic looks more lavender lor but it's grey not lilac.I would take one in each lor.I did replace the gray bow tie with a purple one to add a pop of lor.I was just expecting to be as short" as the picture.Just what I needed, I bought the black with multi lored D/B's so I can use this with any of my Doonies.Unfortunately the white one is see through.Have not used this one yet but I have an older one in different lor.Not as deep as a red as picture vut still very pretty.The multilored one is by far the cutest one.Color is a tad bit more green in person than in the photos and the strings are to be tied unlike in the photo.Does it look like you paid for it?Just as in the picture.Colours don't smear.I got the lor Blue, and it looks like the picture.It's sort of a light brown-grey.see thru but super cute just like pic.The shirt was as described and shown in the pictures.The blue one is a little off but I will still wear it.Just like the pictureLove it, unfortunately it got stained right away:-( Have to avoid white around an active dog.Looks just like the pictureLooks like the pictureI swapped the ribbon for a yellow one that I already had amd wore it with yellow sandals.I was a little disappointed in the picture though; the lors aren't as vibrant as it shows, but I figure that's just because of my monitor.The silver almost has a metallic lor when you look at it from different ways.The lor is a little different than my white gold engagement ring, but it is barely noticeable.Now lets talk about this design for one its begs to be lored in like begs to be.Print wasn't like pictured on image but like stated in the info it wasn't garenteed.The only downfall is that I didn't get any solid lored one.The lors are darker than in the pictureI like the fitting and lor is too orangy I want a little dull).Bought three different lors, all look same as site picture.What can I say more then it's Stihl and its pink?I'm looking to purchase another one, just in a different lorI would buy more if there were different lors.(Blue) Looks just like picture.This dress is all the way blue.Large and black, goes with everythingCute like pictures.Now I want some in purpleWear it a lit so ordered another one in pink, but another black one showed up instead.The lors are bright, fast, and do not fade after several washing.It looks just like the picture except I think the lor in person is a bit redder than burgundy.It does look a bit more brown in certain lights, but I also like that because her hair is a redish-brown and people exaggerate on the red.I will be buying more in a different print.It's cute, just like the picture.Looks just like the photo on Amazon site.The picture on Amazon makes it look like its beige and black but it's gray and black.Love the fit, the lor is bright red and pretty, the only thing I would change is the fact that the ruching detail is only in the front, would be even cuter if the back had it tooAlthough the lor isn't exactly the olive I was looking for, possibly the most difficult lor to match on earth,right??)Guava apparently is de for hot pink.I used it on the shirt pictured and in my son's hair.It's just like the pictureThe Fog lor is just what I was looking for...not black and not neonAlso the lor is just like the picture.Looks just like it did in the picture.Will buy more in yellow and blueThe maroon is more of a dark red, we were expecting darker like a deep red/purple, but that isn't the case.The skirt is more blue than the photo shows on my device, and I like that.Only draw back to this product is you have to read the fine print I did not) as you only get one not a pairThese look just like their photo.I bought the white one first, wore it to an all white beach party then had to order the black one to wear to this adult pajama party.Like painted on her legs.Has a really neat look with the blue running through it.Also, it says black and white Aztec.It is so hard for me to find tops that look ok on me.After receiving this one I was tempted to by another in a different lorThe only thing is the lor I bought was white but what came to me is more like a dirty white to cream lor.Bright pink not reddish as in photo with a tight-fitting bottom half.The lor is a true light orange, the material has a little stretch to it.and so cute.perfect for this hot weather.love it.will get some diferent lors.thank youJust wish I would have gotten more lors cause they're so cute Also, if they were any darker, you uld only wear them in full sunlight.just like the old hyper lor shirtsI came back for a send lor.AND....I was ncerned if the lor was going to work.If they came in another lour, I uld get them.It's definitely white not an off-white or dingy white.Mostly black, but maybe lored.It has not faded or changed since the day we purchased it.I want more lors but you can only use one wallet at a time unless you have a lot of money, which I do not.I may order another in a smaller size different lor.I bought the light blue and looks just like the picture.:) Due to the lighter lor I got the pink face") it is a little more difficult to read in certain angles.I thought pair was in the pack like the pictureIt looks just like the pictures.I was worried the beige would be too tan but it's just rightThe dye is bright and vibrant just like the picture.Its really a pretty red as pictured.It is just like the photo and description.Hard to find in all black with the black soles though.It looks just like that picture.However, with my blush dress, the white ribbon stood out a little too much.It is a straw hat painted black and is about what you would expect it to be for the money.I kept the black one for myself and gave the green one to a friend.I will exchange for another one in a different lor though.If you get the white ones I suggest that you get stch guard and spray them before you wear them if you want to keep the brite white lookLove the lour variety but my package only included black but like or more in the other lours, i would have preferred more black be included but I really can't mplain).Mine arrived black, not yellowish, but no biggie, even oler.I bought the Coa lor in Size XL.I might have to buy the other lorsYes it looks just like the picture.First the shirt isn't that bright of a purple like the picture which was disappointing to me because I wanted it bright.As is in picture.It's too bad it doesn't me in other lors, but the Army green is not as bad as I thought.There seems to be a few small spots on the button-hole lapel that have no purple on them, or something else was on the shirt.Wonder if they make the same shirt with different graphics/lors.The lour matches the picture, so you won't be disappointed by that.i will definately buy another pair soon in another lor.weren't the bright red that the mputer showed but that uld've just been my screen.It is a very pretty shade of pink and the lace is very unusual.I purchased the beige one and will be also ordering one in black.I have this skirt in both black and grey Looks just like the Picture.It has not turned my finger green or left any kind of marks.Just like the photo.The print is super cute, too.Like others have said, it's not really blue.The lor is more yellow than expected, but still cute.Color/look are as pictured.I wish it came in different lors because I would order one in each.It looks just like the photos.(I own black and grey already.)I have ordered different lors drom separate vendors.I lost my original black one.I love that the interior is a dark lor, because my bags tend to get messy at times.In the picture it looked like it is a pink necklace, but it's actually gold, which is not a problem.It's just as it appears in the picture.just like the pictureI got the gray and black, I decided to try these after seeing fakes on Pinterest and Claire's and realizing, they look the sameI tried the black one on in the Spirit Halloween store and I am so glad I ordered the white mask from Amazon instead.So far my finger hasn't turned lor or broken out.This is a very cute bag, I can wear a lot of different lors with it.The lors are dead on.The dress was just like the picture too.I read a reveiw somewhere here saying that the black and white plugs are g and the Amethyst one is a g.Ordered these in Aquamarine, and they really look sharp.Exactly as advertised, looks just like the picture and sizing is spot on.Got the black and maybe will get the brown tooThe lor is pretty and it looks just like the photo.Just like the picIt seems to be holding up and not turning his fingers greenOnly thing I ordered navy and they sent green instead.The tag read yr

the ruching in the front hides any bumps.I'd buy them again in a different lor, and a size smaller.The green is slightly more green and less blue than it looks in the picture, which can make matching them to an outfit slightly more difficult, but they are great.Just like the pictureI think I'll go back and order it in a uple more lors...especially at this priceThe lour is as pictured.The white lor I got is a little transparent.He took the blue ones, and I took the green.Color of stones looks little darker than picture.Also, its not brown" its more like a cream orange but not so bright it
