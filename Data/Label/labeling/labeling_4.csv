1,66002,I like them but I ordered the wrong size and I found the proper size somewhere else.,66002,4,1
2,66002,So I had to return them,66002,4,-1
3,66003,"Beautiful coat, just to small, the sizing details says to order one size up I ordered 2 sizes up to be safe, and it was still small.",66003,4,1
4,66003,even with the size chart is off.,66003,4,1
5,66003,I wish they had it one size larger.,66003,4,1
6,66004,"I'm 5'2"", 108 lbs,  athletic build and this small sweater was a little loose on me, need an xs but they do not sell xs.",66004,4,1
7,66004,"Would be more flattering if it had a tighter fit, but still looks beautiful on the back so I am keeping it.",66004,4,1
8,66005,"Color is beautiful,small through the bust.",66005,4,2
9,66006,"Didn't quite get it in time for Christmas, but the pants are really cute and really soft.",66006,4,3
10,66006,Fit my daughter perfectly.,66006,4,1
11,66006,Size is as expected and the quality was exceptional.,66006,4,-1
12,66006,Would definitely order more like this from this seller.,66006,4,-1
13,66007,Love it but should have ordered a small rather than medium.,66007,4,1
14,66007,If you are slim and tall it will still look great with heels :) I am 5'8 and 145 lb,66007,4,1
15,66008,They are your standard Vans Slip on shoes.,66008,4,-1
16,66008,"They run in the same sizes as my Converse, so they fit well.",66008,4,1
17,66008,"I tried a pair on in the stores thinking I would wear a 7.5 as that is what I would wear in my tennis shoes, but that was a bit too big and a 6.5 was just too small.",66008,4,1
18,66008,The 7 that I got fit perfectly.,66008,4,1
19,66008,My left shoe has something like a flaw where the ball of my foot touches when I step down.,66008,4,3
20,66008,"It's not like that in the right, so I am assuming it's just a small flaw, but it's not a big deal.",66008,4,3
21,66008,I am sure over time I won't eel this anymore.,66008,4,-1
22,66008,"Like Converse, I cannot wear shoes like this for too long.",66008,4,1
23,66008,"If I were going to walk for a long time I would not wear these shoes, but I have trouble wearing shoes with little support.",66008,4,-1
24,66008,I do like them though!,66008,4,-1

26,66009,I ordered this for myself.,66009,4,-1
27,66009,Wanted something sparkly to wear.,66009,4,-1
28,66009,It is a very pretty ring.,66009,4,2
29,66009,"I ordered a size 5, which is the smallest that it came in.",66009,4,1
30,66009,I did have to take it to be re sized as it was still too big.,66009,4,1
31,66009,It actually measured in at a 5.5.,66009,4,1
32,66009,"I will say even after having it resized it is still a bit  big
on my finger.",66009,4,1
33,66009,The band is slim and the stone large which causes it to flop from side to side.,66009,4,1
34,66009,I will have to have a ring sizer placed on the bottom of the band if I want it to sit upright without moving.,66009,4,3
35,66009,"So, in the end although the price for the ring is good with all the added money that I have spent
to get it to look the way I want it is a bit more than what I had intended to pay for a costume piece.",66009,4,3
36,66009,"That being said I am very petite so maybe the ring
does better on someone with a more average sized hand/finger, I still like the ring and really have no regrets with the purchase.",66009,4,3
37,66010,"It's good but, the edges keep unsticking to my skin.",66010,4,-1

42,66012,However 2/6 of them are super difficult to fit over the heel.,66012,4,1
43,66014,"I am giving it a 4 because it did run a little small, but I was still able to squeeze into it ;).",66014,4,1
44,66014,I got sooo many compliments on this dress!,66014,4,1
45,66014,"It is pretty short, so if you are taller you may want to take that into consideration, or you may be wearing it as a shirt.",66014,4,3
46,66014,"I am 5'4"" and I think if I was any taller I may have not been able to wear this.",66014,4,3
47,66014,"But for all you short girls out their, buy this dress!",66014,4,2
48,66014,"You will make every other girl jealous, haha.",66014,4,-1

52,66015,"The only complaints I have are the picture is blurry,you cannot actually see facial details on Jack or Sally.",66015,4,3
53,66015,It is more like a silhouette picture & the charm hangs a bit behind the moon when worn.,66015,4,3
54,66015,Otherwise she loved it.,66015,4,3
55,66016,"Bought this mask for a Masquerade Ball, it is super cure and good quality!",66016,4,-1

57,66016,Overall a super cute mask and good quality for the price.,66016,4,1
58,66017,I like this a lot!,66017,4,2
59,66017,The bottom part and the straps look great-but the top was wayyy too small.,66017,4,1
60,66017,I usually wear a 6-8 so I got a medium I ended up switching out the top part (it slides out) and slid in a bando black top :) But I do like it a lot  !,66017,4,3
61,66018,"The top is a little odd, but not too bad.",66018,4,-1

71,66028,I love my prayer shawl!,66028,4,-1
72,66029,This Bodysocks - Inflatable Ride Me Unicorn is super cute.,66029,4,3
73,66029,The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the fan to inflate the costume is in kind of a weird place where it keeps getting blocked by my leg.,66029,4,1
74,66029,I like the band it back of the hat that helps it stay on.,66029,4,-1
75,66030,"Bag looks just like in the picture, and appears to be of good enough quality for the price, bought it for my girlfriend, who seems to like it too.",66030,4,-1

80,66032,"When I workout, I usually run and I have to put on 2 of these bras, but, I guess that's the plague of having huge boobs.",66032,4,3
81,66032,I have yet to find a sports bra that gives me the hold and support that I need when running with just one bra.,66032,4,3
82,66032,"But, at least with these bras, like I said before, they're so comfortable, EVEN with 2 of them on!",66032,4,3
83,66032,"I love the zipper because I hate having to pull a bra over my head, and it makes it easier to take them on and off when I'm wet or sweaty, which is a plus.",66032,4,-1
84,66033,"Good clarity, low internal reflection.",66033,4,2
85,66033,Tint is not nearly as dark as factory lenses though; in open water or on snow you may still feel some minor discomfort from reflected sunlight.,66033,4,1
86,66033,"Price is right, though.",66033,4,-1
87,66034,Nice looking although a little large.,66034,4,1

117,66043,I simply try to review all purchases to help others decide if this will work for them or if they are getting a quality product.,66043,4,-1
118,66044,"I got the necklace, and by itself it's pretty good quality, but when I wear it at school and I lean down to do work or something and I sit back up it often gets caught in the desk, and breaking the chain, off the chain, etc.",66044,4,3

216,66100,I'm a 36 D so the large worked for me.,66100,4,1
217,66100,Love the shirt tho.,66100,4,-1
218,66102,"This came in true to size, and color, only complaint is that they material is stiffer than expected.",66102,4,-1
219,66102,I believe it will soften over time.,66102,4,3
220,66102,I will update later and say weather or not it did.,66102,4,-1
221,66103,I'm a size 12.,66103,4,-1
222,66103,I ordered an XL.,66103,4,-1
223,66103,It was too snug.,66103,4,1
224,66103,"I gave it to my daughter-in-law, who is a 6.",66103,4,-1
225,66103,I reordered the same shirt in an XXL.,66103,4,-1
226,66104,"Nice size, good colors, feels sturdy, looks nice.",66104,4,-1
227,66106,"I like this shirt, don't exactly love it.",66106,4,-1
228,66106,"I ordered a large, but possibly a medium would have been better.",66106,4,1
229,66106,I normally wear a large or extra large.,66106,4,-1
230,66106,The color is nice.,66106,4,2
231,66107,So far I give this product 4 stars....will be back to give another review if anything changes.,66107,4,-1
232,66107,"Comfy, unlike some nipple jewelry

Cons:
1.",66107,4,-1
233,66107,My nipple bars before were long.,66107,4,2
234,66107,Which I'm used to.,66107,4,-1
235,66107,"If you have large nipples I advise you NOT to buy these, due to the fact they most likely won't fit.",66107,4,1
236,66107,"I had slight trouble getting em on myself, and it took me a few days to get used to the look of such a small piece of jewelry on my nipples
2.",66107,4,1
237,66107,After finally getting them on my one nipple was sore for a day.,66107,4,-1
238,66107,"That could just be my experience due to irritation of trying to get em on

So, so far I think they're great even if they're small.",66107,4,1
239,66107,"But as I read, some have gone bad due to them being ""fake jewelry"".",66107,4,3
240,66107,"In my personal experiences, ALL jewelry I have bought on amazon (which is A LOT) has never went ""bad"".",66107,4,3
241,66107,So I don't assume these will.,66107,4,-1
242,66107,"With that being said, if they do start to go bad, I will be back to warn you.",66107,4,-1
243,66107,"If they dont, this will be my only review lol

All in all, I think they're a great buy (so far!)",66107,4,-1
244,66108,Cute but the black looks a little cheap.,66108,4,-1
245,66108,Overall happy w it tho for the price.,66108,4,-1
246,66112,I like this cover up but it is not as long as pictured.,66112,4,2
247,66112,"I am 5'4"" with average leg length and it hits me at least 3 inches above my knees.",66112,4,1
248,66113,"I love this dress,",66113,4,-1
249,66114,"Very nice beach dress however, I ordered a 2xl after already ordering a xl and it still fits a lil snug in the breast area.",66114,4,1
250,66114,My breast aren't that big that it should never be able to comfortably fit a size 2xl especially considering that my overall size is a lg xl.,66114,4,1
251,66114,I love the style & look of the dress just couldn't fit it.,66114,4,1
252,66115,"If you buy one size larger than normal, you'll love the fit and comfort.",66115,4,1
253,66115,"Incredibly comfortable, just snug enough.",66115,4,1
254,66115,"The fabric is great, and the designs are fun.",66115,4,3
255,66116,"I put these in each pair of shoes that I wear, both tennis shoes and dress shoes.",66116,4,-1
256,66117,"I liked, but ran a little smaller than expected.",66117,4,1
257,66118,It fit nicely !,66118,4,1
258,66119,I features I like are that it's lightweight and that you can pack it into its own pocket to make it easier to transport.,66119,4,3
259,66120,It's a nice hat and fit well.,66120,4,1
260,66120,It also folds up.,66120,4,-1
261,66120,Would be great for packing.,66120,4,-1
262,66120,"However, it was too much with my flowered dress.",66120,4,-1
263,66121,It was a good deal!,66121,4,-1
264,66121,Just dnt have a lot of Wat I'm looking for in my size,66121,4,1
265,66122,"The green ones leave a green color on my lobes, not a big deal bit kind of concerning.",66122,4,2
266,66123,I only gave four cause the word aberration is cut off on the bottom!,66123,4,3
267,66124,Length is a little long but very comfortable and cute!,66124,4,-1
268,66125,The packing box was ridiculously large for the cigarette holder but the holder itself is great!,66125,4,0
269,66126,Cute and comfy leggings.,66126,4,3
270,66126,"When you put them on, they feel like tshirt material.",66126,4,3
271,66126,These showed up more quickly than I expected.,66126,4,3
272,66126,I followed the advice of other reviewers and bought a size bigger.,66126,4,-1
273,66126,"However, I find that they run true to size so mine are loose and baggy.",66126,4,1
274,66126,I was pretty disappointed but to ship them back is more than what I paid for them originally.,66126,4,-1
275,66126,I may buy another pair in the correct size and gift these to someone else.,66126,4,1
276,66127,I had to have surgery on my shoulder and needed some large button up tops...these were the only thing I could find...I had to order 2 XL in order to get what I needed...will probably pass them to someone else who needs tops...I can't  use the bottoms at all.,66127,4,-1
277,66129,Shipped from overseas so they took a long time to arrive and then stuck to high heaven when they arrived.,66129,4,0
278,66129,Decent for the cost but the smell tells me that they aren't safe to use a lot.,66129,4,3
279,66130,"A little stretch to it, makes it comfortable and able to move with you.",66130,4,3
280,66131,"These are very trendy, I love them.",66131,4,-1
281,66131,They're the perfect size for my slim face..,66131,4,1
282,66131,I wouldn't reccomend for rounder faces.,66131,4,1
283,66131,"Although, the female pictured wearing these, hers looked much more rose gold rather than pink.. Unfortunatly, in person, they are much more pink than I expected.",66131,4,2
284,66131,"They are somewhat flimsy, yet, still durable and hold their shape.",66131,4,3
285,66131,"Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.",66131,4,-1
286,66132,I really like the cut and fit a lot.,66132,4,1
287,66132,It looks just as pictured.,66132,4,-1
288,66132,"I am not a fan of the material, though.",66132,4,3
289,66132,"It's not particularly comfortable, and it doesn't really breathe.",66132,4,3
290,66133,"Fits great, and as expected!",66133,4,1
291,66134,it take a while to receive them they fit as i was expected i love them i would buy this product again,66134,4,-1
292,66135,You get what you see.,66135,4,-1
293,66135,Well besides the tights.,66135,4,-1
294,66135,"The tights are like stockings and they were to small for me (I got a 3x-4x), mask was to big but I have another one laying around.",66135,4,-1
295,66135,"The diamonds came off so I had to sew them on, the skirt is to short, and the top shows a lot of cleavage (I have a huge chest), but its cute and it fits :) the arm warmers are perfect and comfy, and the choker is amazing.",66135,4,-1
296,66136,Good sunhat for toddler.,66136,4,-1
297,66136,The hat ties under the neck and has adjustable tie at the base of the head which makes it stay on the head.,66136,4,-1
298,66136,Used this with a swim bodysuit and swim shoes for amazing protection.,66136,4,-1
299,66136,Con: the brim is pretty long for sun protection but can make it hard for a smaller toddler to see and the side of the face is left unprotected depending on the angle of the sun.,66136,4,-1
300,66138,Very cool but detaches very easily.,66138,4,3
301,66139,I'm a size 4 and it was a bit too snug.,66139,4,1
302,66139,I purchased a medium.,66139,4,1
303,66139,I will order a large because I loved it so much.,66139,4,1
304,66140,The company went above and beyond to replace/refund me for a damaged item,66140,4,-1
305,66142,Perfect for the upcoming summer,66142,4,-1
306,66143,Very best Price Quslity,66143,4,-1
307,66144,Used them at my wedding for myself and all guys in the wedding.,66144,4,-1
308,66144,The cufflinks themselves are really good quality.,66144,4,3
309,66144,The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the box (while looking really cool) doesn't have a lid that will stay on.,66144,4,3
310,66144,"To fix this, I just wrapped a bow around the box which worked really well.",66144,4,-1
311,66145,The top fit very oddly (lots of extra fabric in rear) and was a little itchy.,66145,4,3
312,66145,The arm bands were ridiculous and would only fit someone with wrists like the Hulk.,66145,4,3
313,66145,"Otherwise, for it's purposes as a one time only costume, it was fine and fit my family theme.",66145,4,-1
314,66146,This is my favorite bikini set!,66146,4,-1
315,66146,The actual bikini is pretty similar to the one in the picture.,66146,4,3
316,66146,It runs a little larger than I had hoped because I read a review that stated it ran small.,66146,4,1
317,66146,I would recommend ordering your actual size.,66146,4,1
318,66146,The back of the top does not have a clasp and cannot be opened or closed.,66146,4,-1
319,66146,"The back of the bottoms have complete coverage and are thin, but not see through.",66146,4,3
320,66146,"The shipping took a few weeks, but it was worth it.",66146,4,0
321,66146,The only other thing I would consider a negative is that it doesn't have too much elasticity.,66146,4,3
322,66146,"The top ripped slightly on the corner when I was putting it on, but it's nothing a little light sewing can't fix.",66146,4,3
323,66147,Super soft and comfortable.,66147,4,3
324,66147,"When purchasing this robe, it is important to realize that it is made to be comfortable and not super sexy.",66147,4,3
325,66147,Over all beautiful; not too small and not to big.,66147,4,1
326,66147,"I'm 5'7"" at 120lb and it fits me perfectly.",66147,4,1
327,66149,Ordered to match my rose gold / silver / black watch and jewelry.,66149,4,-1
328,66149,Am only wearing the three rings that match this color scheme.,66149,4,2
329,66149,"They look great and have held up to a few weeks of daily wear without noticeable scratches, dulling nor tarnishing.",66149,4,3
330,66149,"The three stars rating, is because I measured my ring finger and then ordered the size 8, per the chart.",66149,4,1
331,66149,Yet the size 8 rings turned out to be way too big for my ring finger.,66149,4,1
332,66149,"Am having to wear them on my middle finger, even though they are a tad loose on that finger, also.",66149,4,1
333,66149,"Had they conformed to the sizing chart, I would've given them the higher rating.",66149,4,1
334,66149,"This said, the extra space has allowed me to ""link"" the rings together as a precaution against the ""pinching"" reported by a few other reviewers, via adhering a thin, black plastic band along the inside of the rings.",66149,4,1
335,66150,Lighter than I thought it would be.,66150,4,2
336,66151,Great value for a VV tie.,66151,4,3
337,66151,"Wish it came tied, for gift giving / presentation purposes (and I don't know how to tie a bow tie).",66151,4,-1
338,66151,"It's a legit bow tie, though, not a clip on.",66151,4,3
339,66152,"Very cute, love the design.",66152,4,-1
340,66152,I'm a curvy girl so it was a little small in the buttocks region but still cute.,66152,4,-1
341,66154,Thin but that's to be expected.,66154,4,3
342,66154,Perfect for indoors or warm weather .,66154,4,-1
343,66154,They are very cute!,66154,4,-1
344,66156,My son loves these shoes for baseball..,66156,4,-1
345,66157,I am obsessed with this top.,66157,4,-1
346,66157,I have received a ton of compliments from it already.,66157,4,-1
347,66157,It's nice to wear over the spring and summer.,66157,4,-1
348,66157,It's a little see-through so you might want to wear a tan bra underneath.,66157,4,3
349,66157,The only thing I disliked was the lose threads in the inside.,66157,4,3
350,66157,"However, it is worth every penny!",66157,4,-1
351,66158,Company positive to deal with,66158,4,-1
352,66159,Really pretty cover up.,66159,4,-1
353,66159,The only downside is that the tassels at the bottom aren't secure so they will eventually fall off.,66159,4,3
354,66159,I only noticed this because a few of them were on the floor.,66159,4,-1
355,66159,"To solve this, I simply knotted each group of tassels.",66159,4,-1
356,66159,"Other than that, love it!",66159,4,-1
357,66160,Good rain jacket for travel.,66160,4,-1
358,66160,"It would be nice it it had a dedicated pocket for self-stowing, and the hood makes side-view a bit difficult.",66160,4,-1
359,66160,"The blue color I chose was discounted, but looks fine.",66160,4,2
360,66161,"It's roomy, it looks good (a little too good, but I'll fix that.",66161,4,1
361,66161,"Only gave 4 stars because I'm not 100% sure that the strap is real leather, but it's leather enough for my purpose.",66161,4,3
362,66161,"If you are going to use this as a costume piece, make sure you get it in enough time to weather it a bit!",66161,4,3
363,66162,I bought this product for my one year old son and he absolutely loves it.,66162,4,-1
364,66162,The grip on the bottom is helpful when he's running around the house so he doesn't fall.,66162,4,-1
365,66162,The design is adorable and he's face lit up as soon as he saw the shoes.,66162,4,-1
366,66162,I would recommend this product(:,66162,4,-1
367,66163,The suede tends to look dirty - as if there's dust/dirt coated over them.,66163,4,2
368,66163,"They're a dusty black color, in other words.",66163,4,2
369,66163,They fit true to size.,66163,4,1
370,66164,ordered one size larger fits great.,66164,4,1
371,66164,Time will tell about the endurance but very nice so far.,66164,4,-1
372,66165,So I got a medium and I'm 5'6 145 and everything fit good except for the legs.,66165,4,1
373,66165,They were a little tight but nothing horrible.,66165,4,1
374,66165,Didn't cut off circulation or anything.,66165,4,-1
375,66165,Gotta get used to bring squeezed but I like it.,66165,4,1
376,66165,The before and after picture is all the proof u need.,66165,4,-1
377,66165,Just get the right size!,66165,4,1
378,66166,very pretty and well made BUT they do run small.,66166,4,1
379,66166,"If you wear a large, probably go at least 2 sizes up.",66166,4,1
380,66167,"Nice fit, good tummy control and but lift.",66167,4,1
381,66167,Wires hurt a bit though when sitting down,66167,4,3
382,66168,Great color and lots of storage pockets and slots.,66168,4,2
383,66168,The wallet was a little longer than I expected but holds all my stuff nicely.,66168,4,1
384,66169,This product is great for the lazy dresser like myself.,66169,4,-1
385,66169,It definitely has a loose fit which is what I was going for.,66169,4,1
386,66169,I ordered the mossy green shirt dress and it's true to color in the photo.,66169,4,2
387,66169,I've thrown it in the washer and dryer twice now and there was no shrinkage and it's still as soft as when I got it in the mail.,66169,4,3
388,66169,"The length is perfect as it hits my mid thigh and I am about 5'7"".",66169,4,1
389,66170,Very sheer as stated in other reviews and the quality is as expected for the price!,66170,4,3
390,66171,"Not quite the beanie I wanted--pops up off the top of the head, but warm as hell",66171,4,-1
391,66172,I love it is very good.,66172,4,-1
392,66172,I wear it every day.,66172,4,-1
393,66173,Exactly like it is pictured.,66173,4,-1
394,66173,This is not a real stone though.,66173,4,3
395,66173,"It is more of a plastic resin, as Opalite is not a real stone (Google it).",66173,4,3
396,66173,BUT it is very lovely on.,66173,4,-1
397,66173,"The chain I was sent is a bit different, more of a flat chain, and I actually like it better than the one in the picture.",66173,4,3
398,66173,"This ""stone"" is actually pretty cool.",66173,4,-1
399,66173,I notice it picks up what ever color you are wearing.,66173,4,2
400,66173,"So it is more blue if you are wearing blue, more pink if you are wearing pink.",66173,4,2
401,66173,Which is a fun trait for it to have.,66173,4,-1
402,66173,I think it is fairly good quality for the price and would suggest to other buyers.,66173,4,3
403,66174,Would have been 5 stars if the neck hole wasn't super tiny.,66174,4,1
404,66174,The photo is awesome though.,66174,4,3
405,66174,Hope my son can get his head through it.,66174,4,1
406,66175,"If you have a bigger behind, it will not cover.",66175,4,1
407,66175,I'm not sure if that's clear or not.,66175,4,-1
408,66176,"IT IS A NICE TEE, VERY WELL MADE, All my T's have to be a bit larger because I am upfront - you know the rest of the story.",66176,4,1
409,66176,"Nice color too,  I will again order this T in different color.",66176,4,2
410,66177,"Super cute, casual earrings, they were smaller than expected however everything else was great!",66177,4,1
411,66177,"Came on time in a little earring box with as small bag of earring backs, there was no chance of them smashing in the mail.",66177,4,1

417,66181,"He's nearing 30 and loves anything comic related, so this ended up being a good choice.",66181,4,-1

420,66181,It's a really nice looking wallet.,66181,4,-1
