Looks even better than the picture.This is my favorite purse because it matches everything I wear.It holds everything I need.It is a very elegant looking multi lored purse.I absolutely love it.It wasn't well made at all.These gloves are NOT lined in cashmere.I've owned cashmere lined gloves for years and I know what cashmere is and what it looks like and how warm it is in very ld temps.The gloves LOOK nice, but if you want cashmere, don't order these.The material is soft and stretchy.If you're looking to tighten your re areas postpartum; you'll need something tougher.It's mfy and soft.Could be great at bedtime.These are much cheaper looking and feeling than the picture.In Addition to the attrocious handiwork, the fabric is very thin.The width is appropriate fitting.It's a great skirt, material is nice, flowy and ol.One spot said.This is stretchy tshirt/pijama material, and the white is absolutely see through.. Beautiful design cheap material.The look would be great but you need to secure the crystal somehow.I ordered this shirt for a send time, because the first was great quality.Other than that I love the tank tops.Simple as that.Super soft, fit well, look great, fantastic price.The item that I received was not that as the picture.Would have been a nice top otherwise.I don't mind spending money for a quality product however these socks are NOT good quality.Not the best material or craftsmen ship.Cute purse.This necklace was nice but it ntinues to me undone.Not very good quality.I have the real pandora charm and bought this as a gift but had to return since it looks like a cheap knockoffArrived in piecesI specifically ordered the fuchsia bag which I absolutely LOVED to match my dress for my sisters wedding as maid of honor and the bag I received had barely any pink stones on it it was mostly orangeIt's nothing fancy but it was mfortable.Very expensive for luggage ver No durability.Took forever to receive item.For the money paid I expected a better quality product.It barely got my petite year old neice and the material was not of good quality.It is a beautiful piece though.It smells like plastic.Although, I tend to think that if it was THAT damaged from shipping box was fine, but there was a box of legos in the box with the umbrella) then it's not a very durable item.Not good at all, no supportNot satisfied with the quality.Material did not line up.Not mfortable.Other ones I've bought have at least lasted a uple months of daily wear by an active toddler before getting holes.I was so excited to find these to use for my water aerobics.First of all, the material was OKAY.The hands freely move now so you can noy tell time on it any more.Horrible nothing work well look tips and one me without battery garbageThe padding was very noticible, and just not flattering overall.The pockets are a good " from the waistband.They go to about your chin and are thick strips that cannot be manipulated to go back with the rest of the hair to make it look more authentic.You're better off buying a good quality blonde wig and dying it yourself.That's right, they can't even handle a few weeks of walking without breakingThe product picture is not accurate.I purchased top and bottom rings.This is a scrap of material and isn't flattering at all.Not for sensitive skin Wanted the shirt as a gift and thought it would be perfect.Loved the idea and the visual but their attention to detail was not appreciated.I'm in my 's and shows every ounce of fatThis shirt has snaps instead of buttons and the snaps are not attached well to the fabric.And the design just doesn't work for meThis is knock off of a beautiful designer dress.Not much space, looks and feels cheap, overall not worth the money they're charging.Not a fan of these undies and don't remmend them.My son has only used Bobux shoes and they have proven to be sturdy, ergonomic and very durable.Though they are quite expensive, I mpensate it by having just a pair of shoes and a pair of sandals for every size my son gets.The shoes get battered but they remain nice and mfortable the whole time.Quality always over quantity.Much rather pay twice the pricee for something more durable.Every style she tried didn't work because it didn't ver enough surface area.It fit okay and the material was soft and flowed.This jacket is NOT waterproofI did not like the quality of this shirtIt's a mfortable and stylish ring, but don't plan on wearing itdress opens up everywhere it def needs to be sewn down more.I am shopping for alternatives.For the price should've known it was polyester.The idea is great but it is not well executed.The models pictured are short...The illusion as it appears that the garmet is long and free...TALLER MODELS..however the material is fineThe item I received is NOT the item described.The smell was just so strong.at first long time to wait order and send wear one week and lost because lock was very simple not keeping and not work well....The straps me apart nstantly you have to ntinue reattaching them-plus it tears the material Colors are enticing, but that is itI thought it would be a better materialThis is NOT a simply southern T-Shirt.However, it took almost one month to get it, by then I had no use for it.Have to agree with the other reviewer not made for real women.Holds well until the support band starts to buckle.not a good quality itemthese are very lovely but only if your using this on your child was not long enough for meNot good quality, I'm afraid to wash it.This overat in picture looks great, the one you will receive after you purchase will be totally different.I ordered two because I absolutely loved it, when it arrived it came in pieces strings wrap.They don't work with any touch screenThey should be loose flattering but they're too tight/ not cute on.It's a nice slim case that looks great on the phone.However it is very smooth which is a problem when handling with one hand.This came with an aweful smell washed it and it still has that scent.Not a good quality at all....Material is like a parachute, not a flattering dress and unmfortable.M. FranliniI love this necklace, but I can't wear itIt was a pretty stone but it fell out of the setting the first time my daughter wore itI had to return as the clarity was very CloudyIt is not the original brand, but replicaCut, material quality.The earrings were not hypoallergenic as described.Yes the price is awesome but the product is cheap.Ill fitting for girls with any curves.When I first received it I put it on and wore it a few hours on the first row of hooks and loved it, it fit perfectly.If i uld give stars i would, yes they are beautiful so i guess star is fine, but they already brokeThis is a super cheap knock off of the nice Carter's design which is what you see in the picture.This bag is no good ....the quilty is not good that allVery cute necklace and design, just wish I had actually gotten a chance to wear itYou can't find a mfortable way to wear this.I have seen better quality made and sold on Pintrist and my local buy and sell facebook pages.Not really sure if I can leave accurate feedback.Obviously I didn't think it would be of awesome quality with low price.They looks good when you take them out of the package but that's where the good feelings end.Is not the size you order very very cheap material mine as well wear a plastic bag... Looks better online ...The leather was very thin and made of small peace's of leather... just now a good product.Don't Waist Money On This Product.This we're a great disappointment.Did not offer the cushion or support I was looking for.Bubble gum machine quality.Didn't wash well at all little fabric is full of pilling.Not worth the headache or expense to return it.So in the washer it went as well as Unstoppables to hopefully get the strong musty smell out.Definitely not made for Euro-American bodies.Pajama top.. not a shirt..Nice design.The top is stretchy and clingy, it fits but it is tight, The skirt, no chance.Thak goodness these were not expensivedid not realize it had gold backing.love pearls but with silver.This isn't jade it's agate Its a great product but hate that I opened the package and it had dog hair I don't have a dog) all over it and make upDresses that st this much should be properly tailored as shown in the photos) and not need to rely on trash techniques like smocking for fit.If you plan on wearing a bra or have siline, the dresses are pretty and made of a good quality woven rayon.When even expensive clothing isn't made properly, I cannot hope to find anything that fits rrectly on Amazon.Good quality but in order to enjoy wearing it I have to purchase a X.... -/Hi I purchased this item together with a Manstore women's printed active workout Capri on June th.I have NEVER heard of water doing this to leatherIt wasn't made well.The dress didn't even have tags with brand or care information.It was a very tight fitting dress not sure if I'll wear this out.It's a beautiful dress and the fabric isn't at all itchy like I expected.I was so inlove with it, it looks beautiful but even though is loose it freaking ripped after hours I had it on.Quality was not worth the price.I ordered this beautiful wrap, and Ir said % rayon, I just received my package and on the label it says % rayon and % tton.I don't wear mixed fabrics, I only wear %.Feels warm though and quality looked pretty good which I didn't expect.Phone description of what was inside package and price I paid.Maybe China's custom.The quality is mparable to the priceVERY Large .. Not a delicate piece of jewelry.Not the material I expected.The material is great.Its was to large and the strings were hangingRediculous.It is not stretchy; not enough material to let out.There is elastic in waist line but too small for stretch to ensure one size fit all" description.Not a feminine ringIt is more of a dry fit material.These briefs would better suit a female due to the lack of room for male genitalia.I really wanted to love this purse, here is why: It's lightweight, mfortable, has great pockets and tons of room.Should have listen to the other reviews on here that said this shoe can cut your child's feet.This needs to be v removed or represented accurately.Quality of material very p door.Not soft.Have spayed everything I uld find, aired outside, inside, inside out.I got it for my friends shower and was to see through to wear itIt had a strong smell.Funny thing is I ordered a Trump hat for my husband and it is not only embroidered but is made with high quality materials.It's like a bulk production of an inferior product and they decided to put the Laste name to make it more appealing the brand doesn't matter to me just the style).So if you've never seen or worn these socks, then you will not know any better.But if you are looking for the original like I was, THESE ARE NOT IT.The fabric is stretchy, soft and mfortable, but not the way the fabric looks in the photo.Not happy that the frames were not nsistent with the picture as advertisedAlmost like kerosene.just not what i expected looks very cheap and I really wasn't mfortable to give as a gift.They are GREAT quality just what damn baby are they made for?It looks like a beach ver up or a moo moo that my grandmother would have worn after she had taken her bath.I fell in love with the fact it was a romper the print is adorableThe rose gold" was chipping off, and the ball didn't sit evenly in the ring.The material was fine.The quality of the dress didn't meet my exceptions.Looks better in picture then in person.Cheap quality and arms do not flow well with the overall shirt.The material is so soft.I thought these were the perfect alternative to sleeping in a nursing bra.Expected it to be much longer and flow more.I don't like the materialThey spent more money on the quality of the case and the packaging than they did for the glasses.My diamonds are falling out would like a replacement pleaseThe stone fell out of its placement within days after receiving it.The material is see through, not worth the money.She is very hard on shoes but I thought they would at least look presentable for a uple months.This product's pictures are far from realityClear above ankles.Don't beleive product descriptionNot as good quality as what it looks like in the pic.I will still make use of it, it's just not what I wanted.All at a lesser st they were a much better quality of what I received.Not a very acurate description.It's very sheer, much more suited to be a nightgown.The dress is see thruSo I thought, perfect.Beyond that, the set seemed decent enough for the price, not especially high quality but good enough to get as a one off when trying to match a wedding date.I bought this as a present and thinking that since it was made of leather that it would be a better quality product...WRONGThe dress is sheerScratchy material.And even hours later, they are not at all mfortable.I bought and was full of fuzz and the other was a disgusting blob.It looks perfect, I used it in a wedding, after I put it in the toiletry pocket bag for min.The stitching of the pocket is not finished rrectly.The Stones fell out very quickly and the only good thing about this is the chain is still the same lor.That Chick does not have any stitching in the middle. they were COMPLETELY see through.My husband told me honestly that these pants just don't look right, and looking at myself in different mirrors in our home, he is right.I thought there might be some pieces that were to large, after fixing" that I still uld not get them in.We tried to find all of the beads so that we can buy a strong string, BUT we can't find most of them.Quality ntrol not goodI'm not like it quality is not goodSeller claims this is a stretch material however I got the equivalent of cheep curtain material that was shoddily finished."Surely," I thought, it wasn't intended to be worn this way?"I figured it had to be adjustable.Completely different craftsmanship--it is a stronger, heavier metal that I easily bent to the shape I need.It looks very nice in pictures, but no way will this top fit.They are not bows:) Tip: T shirts are not really quality.Well, received the /" length I ordered for my face piercing.You must be flat chested to wear this.I bought this thinking it was made from faux leather and it clearly says genuine leather.I did not want a leather belt as I am anti leather.stay away from it if you have allergies.Is very simple.Low and behold after weeks of searching I found this purse I actually liked aesthetically as well.The beading is gaudy and not attractive.It does not look like the picture, which was a huge letdown because I was so excited to receive it.I received this product at a disunt in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.This is heavy double knit fabric... definitely not something I'd wear.I would say it's a fine hat but if it fades that fast during delivery then I can only give it one star.The band broke the st week I received it .. starsThe picture looks great, but this is not how the product looks.It's definitely NOT a toe RINGThis time I was not impressed in fact I am disappointed I won't wear this piece of clothing because of the strong smell of gasoline it has.I bought this dress because it was tton and when it came it was silky non stretchy materialI was very happy to receive this ring.The hat was no embroidered, it was an iron on sticker.I just got it and it's stainedBeautiful fabric but that doesn't matter when you can't wear itThe watch band does not me already intact/ put together.I am throwing the now broken band away and getting a NORMAL watch bandI thought this was an attractive shawl based on the picture.Leggings are not mfortable on the skin or to be in.The leggings are made out of material that makes you feel like plastic, you sweat you legs thighs everything for no reason because they don't breathe.I like the material, it's soft but with certain undergarments the dress sticks to your body.I need something with a higher heel and a lot more padding.Nice design but plan on getting only one two uses out of itNot very good quality and it's not like the pic.Beautiful DressIt clearly was not going to stretch out for the -months gift I needed.This bracelet is adorable but not durable.The bottom portion of the lock is broken and no longer attached to the case.The lights did not work properly.The fabric quality is not good The material is cheap feeling although the lor looks nice.I bought this belt because I am allergic to nickel and other cheap metals, and I assure you it is not hypoallergenic stainless steel.Water resistant for fog, maybe, but the send you're in a real rain you're wet through.I feel like they were trying to save on st by using less material.This jewelry is s***.Great product.I would think that a purse should last longer than a months.The quality is as expected of tton- the cut is boxy and just not attractive for a woman.If you want to were as a long shirt, it may be okay, though the material is pretty cheap and doesn't feel great.super cheap product it would be perfect if it was max i bought for less this hoodie DKNY Jeans Men's Full Zip Hooded Sweatshirt-Charal, Medium which is times betterI wanted it loose.I expected them to be not as well made as they turned out to be.The lenses are flat and in no way curved so don't think they are curved like regular sunglasses.I love that they are transparent but still have that chrome shine on the lenses and I love that they are big, even on my face.not made well.Not good qualityShame really since the material feels nice and the cut is lovely.Not a generous return policy, and no return packaging included.Definitely not a good investment.My wife said the fit was fantastic but she can't wear them because the seam had a hole from not being sewn.TOO much material.To flashy to my tasteIt looks wonderful on the model.Sweater is very thin and seems like it would be mfy to lounge around in.Most underwear at least has a bit of lining in the crotch and bathing suits definitely, but not these.I had not planned to use it as a top, so that was fine.As of the time I'm writing this, I'm nearly weeks pregnant and my hips are so sore, I thought this might help alleviate some of my issues.Not happy with the product.These are not as thick as Lobe Wonder and no textured surface.However the material is so rough it did more harm than goodI've purchased this twice and it is broken AGAINToo flexible, no support.very saddening as i was excited about it fabric is actually pretty good quality as well.If this dress were white you uld definitely see thru it.Fabric was more like pajamas.just go with the more expensive brand.Cracked on first day and didn't really feel much sun protection.Great customer serviceFace would not stay on watch.The send hand was not working when the watch arrived.I didn't like the material.Ink isn't expected to last long because it seems to not adhere to the material properly.Well made but runs very bigI've seen better quality clothing at the dollar storeLooks great upon arrival.These slip off my heels even though there is a nice silin strip in the back.I washed them a uple types thinking they might shrink a little bit and hang on better, no luck.These would have worked fine as a regular tshirt bra, but not a good product for postpartum/nursing body.Okay so first of all its not tton.Looks nice but it is a lot shorter than the picture showsit is a warm at and fur looks real from afar but hands down not worth freaking USD the at is not advertised rrectly because no one would buy it if they knew the truthIt's a nice looking robe.It's a heavy knit but the one I received was not evenly dyed as if it had been washed and the lor ran out.I uldn't breathe mpletely without risking ripping the top.Shirt is cute and stylish for younger ladies.Material not as expected.I liked the feel of it, I loved the lor, I liked the fit but I don't care for the sheer look so I returned it.Not warm.... very silky ol fabricI seems to be well made but because it has no pocket like the picture showed I won't buy this brand again.Decent at, but would not work for real low temperatures.Seems well made.Very cheesy knockoffThe material is not soft.I returned it as it looks much better in the picture than in real life.I received mine and it did not have grooves on it to be able to screw it into the top and bottom.The skirt is made totally different.And they are NOT fleeceThere are other brands of similar shirts with better fabrics and cuts.I felt like the dress looked quite different once I received it, mpared to the photo.Clearly they are just padding their rating to make their profile look good.My daughter purchased this ring with her allowance money in March .I do not trust their feels mfortable all day long" statement now.On the inside of these socks, they are super rough and feel really unmfortable fresh off the shipping box/ brand new).Thick women be aware.S*** quality, it's fake leatherGreat for a joke, but not for practical wear.Plus the cameo is glued on.Not happy with the quality of this bag.Just rides up again and again, very unmfortable to wear, gets wrinkles in it the first time you wear it and they never go away.They are cute pajamas but I don't like the stretchy materialmaterial feels good.This wasn't a very well made tankini and it offered no support.My entire night was dull as I uld not move or dance mfortably with the length.Should have a little flexibility at the sides for ntour fitI spent good min cutting them off.This is a Joke of a necklace.Doesn't have crotch snaps for easy diaper change?The only plus is that the waistband is made of a smooth girdle like material.There was no bracket in the jewelry boxThe material is some type of shiny, scratchy and to me nasty feeling I am a texture person).I think the material is nice and sewn well but I'm not a fan of the print after seeing it in person.The only reason my rear was vered was because it's longer in the back.Not really worth purchasing, I will go real leather next time.Not good productThe hat shiwn in the picture was not what I received.However it was form fitting.Quality was NOT as expectedglasses are just as described yet mine came with a gold rim I did not find very attractive.Very cute elephant ring.Send Order Arrived totally Wrinkled Bad arms too long Not Happy st me more with Return shipping plus shipping Was not Happy I'm '" and I doubt they would have been long enough if I was '".the mintues hand did not work.Good for the price, but don't expect it to last forever.The beading is vastly different....You can see where they didn't see it together.At this writing, I see that it is being sold for half the price I paid for it which was very inexpensive even at that.)I'm ' lb with decent curves still.The diamonds are falling out of it.Nice length though.I love this necklace and get a lot of mplements but on the left side bottom of my necklace there are green beads between the black jewels) that aren't on the other side.The image is great and ol and vivid but once again, this is yet ANOTHER tshirt purchased on Amazon that's s***ty quality tton.Showed every uneven part of your body.this is not gold foil.The solid ties were great.The earrings are nice and I have no intentions of returning the set, but I did have to denstruct the necklace and re-space the nstituent pieces, but once I did I love the organic feel of said pieces.It is base metal in the shape of hearts.The material is not good.I don't know what's cheaper the tramp, the husband or both.Not even the weight of a light-weight shoe laceYou don't even need to hold it up to the light to see right through iti had that purse for days and the zipper brok, realy after days,Haven't worn it once.My daughter wanted this dress for a dance, I wasn't sure what the quality would be like because the price was so low.The white is to hard to clean, the bottom was worn after a week.Quality is not great.The quality was definitely not what was shown in the pictures.After hand washing and hanging it to dry it shrunk down to where I can no longer wear it.Is transparentUnder the arms hangs down so very low when you bend over you can see everything.Strings hanging from everywhere.Great customer serviceI realize it was inexpensive but had hoped to be able to stretch over a wooden frame to display in den.My wife wanted this necklace for a professional look for work.You need to have kegs,as long as a treeLove the skirt.It is made well.Adorable for a flat chested mama in her very first trimester.I guess I should expect to get what I pay for and this item being as inexpensive as it is I should expected it to be junk.They keep falling off, double sided flares are better in my opinion.It came with two one broke before I even used it and the other one broke after one wear her beautiful but awful quality also customer service was pretty good....If is had been manufactured better, with the knee pad and gauntlets tighter, it would've been better.This is not mpression material.The body proportions or off for me.Not a good product.They are mfortable however, so cheaply made even mfort doesn't give them an extra star.the product is not genuine and arrived striped sun glasses.it is not waterproof at all, wet inside after playing in the snow.Received the foot fitter the nut on the threaded rod was stripped so it didn't work sent it back and ordered another one so well see if this one worksIt is made out of some kind of nylon fabric that is more suitable for an umbrella.This product did not remove the gunk from my ring or restore my rings natural beauty.A brush was not included although it stated it would be, but the handle made is nvenient for removing the jewelry.Shiny material.I would have gladly paid more for a quality product that resembles the expectation the picture sets.Beautiful Henley but not women's shirtIt's definitely NOT A BEACH TOWEL.I don't like the material.Dress quality was good.This is a gorgeous false septum.However, it does not have a good grip, I had to tighten it to make it hold and that tweaked the derative lace.I give it star because it is cute and well made.Nice but too big for my use.The necklace is sturdy, but does NOT have turquoise in it like the photo.I don't have enough hips to hold this up, for this to stay in place but it was inexpensive and worth a try.Not well made.This shirt is very shiny.The hat would not stay down over my ears.The wallet was great in the beginning, great to look at, nice design, great feel to it.the charms are not well madeShirt is nice soft tton.It is made of a stretchy material but I still uldn't get it buttoned.BUYER BEWARE: Seller needs to make buyers aware they are buying cheap China quality.Not happy with this product.I loved these until I washed and dried them.Not well made at allI loved this, but it broke last night.Model looks great in the photo, but this dress is really just a long drapey sack of polyester.The price is tempting, the final results less so.It looked nice until I wore it for about weeks straight then I noticed some stones were missing.I've had good experience with buying this brand before, but would not remmend this style.Is it real goods??Quality was ok for thr price... star b/c I had to.Had the stones not fallen out, it would have been great.The mesh isn't as soft as expected and... getting excited, shall we say, will make you want to go mmando.The material I nice and had it been a little longer I would like it but it doesn't sit very well on me so now I have no purpose for it.Especially after reading how precise the stitching would be.Purchase was a disappointment but detail on rset was beautiful.It's basically a turtleneck.The lights did not work, had to put new batteries in it to make it work,They are very supportive and nothing moves around.Well I bought the -pack of Mediums and the material is now different and the bras are so loose.She stopped wearing them after a uple weeks because they were no longer mfortable.These are NOT LEATHER as listed.See through material.No lining, definitely wouldn't want to get this wet.Is easier to damage it than to damage a pantyhose.Not as cute in person as it is in the photoLooks better in the picture.This gift of Penguin PJs was ripping at the seams within hours of putting it on and wearing around the house.Wasn't happy with the fabric or the fitYou will have to spend money to get the top altered.Also did not like the quality of the dress will be sending it backFits well, but even after having it cleaned, it left black stains on my skin.Dress just wasn't made or tailored properlyLooks way better in the pics.Was hoping for an edgy but minimal look, but this screams attention seeking.I'll keep the frames and wear the clear lens on evening rides until they break too.needs to be iron and its takes a long time to do that I won,t buy them againPrior to the strap breaking, it was an excellent wristlet and carried everything I needed it to keys, cards, cash change, and headphones) without a problem.They are a nice looking sandal though.Plus it smelled from overseas shipping.Not riding quality.The ring is gorgeous though.no elastic at the ankle so they will not stay on at the beach, I will be returning these.I did not know that it was denim.Not waterproof at all.It's mpletely see through.I will wash it several times with hot water and hope for the best.This was not the necklace I received,.I received a a huge blue heart necklace that was as big as the one on the titanic and not cute at all.You would think Ultra Cotton would not feel like you are wearing a sand paper shirtThe higher-quality versions are from Haiti.Material is poor quality therefore not a good fit.I bought this product because it said it was sterling silver and after days of wearing it, I woke up this morning with a bunch of hives and it turned my finger green so it is not sterling silver.They slide off the shoesI don't know what kind of material was used but definitely not what was shown on pictureThe picture shows that it is a high-quality image.It was mpletely sheer.Not the great quality I was hoping to receive based on the great reviews.The box is a cute touch, my daughter felt really special receiving it.I know it was really cheap but these little things are great for kids....usually.I lost the piece to my original piercing and was looking for something made with a higher quality metal.I loved this bag great lor, perfect for my weekly shuttle to the west ast.It was the quality of a first time sewer who doesn't understand fabric and grain.mpletely sheer.I am giving it a star for the mfy material and its lor, however, there's no way of styling this as the picture and I am returning it.I don't expect this to last long which is unfortunate because it is very cute and mfortable.See through polyester material.This ring is beautiful for about an hour until the fake sterling silver wears off and turns your finger green.Not thermal.They are hard and rigid and not mfortable.I didn't expect luxury but per the description and reviews I did expect quality not flea market boots.The dress I received came stained...Would be improved by getting rid of cheap aspects of the item: i.e material, metal, safety pins and improve size/length.Fruit of the Loom.We never used them as I was ncerned about circulation and the tight elastic.They're pretty but not made well to last.Didn't know that they are made of paper.It looked and felt great for about a month.Bought it for my grand-daughter.Not happy with the product the material was not as i expectedNot quality at all.And it's basically a white night gown with.*THERE WAS NO RING IN THE PACKAGEAlthough the product looks great on arrival, after three months the bracelet turned pper lor.Does not work if you have saggy breast and no help in uplifting too...The material had a plastic feel and the gold links were not my taste.Got a totally different shirt and tie.this is a design for Bean Pole People" the shirt itself in very nicely madeWould not last long if worn daily.Yes they are soft, but for fifty bucks I expect my pants to stay up.I do love the rope straps but other than that...But for knockoffs, what are you going to do?Worked as a last minute deals but didn't hold together, was not mfortable and looked real s***ty.I'm thinking about just bleaching it.?bleach smell is better than that smell any dayBut, it now turns my wrist green, and the crystal fogsThe top part of the swimsuit did not fit rrectly even though there was padding/built in bra.Material was unmfortable, although the style was cute.I am not happy with the actual cape but decided to keep it and hopefully I will actually wear it at some point.Doesn't look well made.If you want a necklace that is good, buy it from another seller.And the dress don't feel good at all.I was so happy with this brand's push up two peice tankini so I thought this would be awesome as well.Not mfortable, not that stretchy.One good thing the material FEELS amazing.No mpression quality whatso ever.Completely see through.The fabric in the picture makes it look like the material is textured but it is definitely a picture added to the dress.It took weeks for this to get to me, and when I finally did get it it was broken, not worth the time or moneyThey are very pretty stones but the quality of the metal is not as statedThe picture was taken just days after they were delivered to my door.It is the olest looking hat.The soft interior material is only at the ankle and did not appeal to my nephew who has sensory issues.We were able to find pants for him that had smooth, soft material lining the entire garment, allowing him to wear the pants without feeling the rough side of the material on his legs.Looks good in the pictures.and smells funny.Headbands don't stay in place.(Rhinestone Row, Elastic Number Three in my line up of bracelets from this seller.It is a pretty piece that isn't crafted very well at all.Beautiful shirt.Not happy with product.Arrived fast, beautiful material, fit was a little large but otherwise flowed nicely I bought one size up after reading reviews).I never tried it on because I cringed just thinking about having the material touch my body.The shirt drapes beautifully and is true to size including a perfect length.Nylon chiffon replaced silk chiffon in the 's.To find an all linen, wool, silk or even tton top these days, one must look among men's shirts or a high end fashion brand.Inexpensive neckloace, though, so you get what you pay for.Not quality merchandise.Feel apart on first washing.It's a nice looking dress of it someone actually took the time to make it right.I probably uld have easily had it fixed but the price was so low I figured oh well I'll just wear the other one tomorrow night.I've ordered products from Mandala Crafts before and have always been satisfied.The product was well made but the sizing was so random.I purchased this bag for my international trip and when i opened the package there was an odor.I ordered this knitted sweater" for my wife.It looks more like material you would use for a sweatshirt, definitely not a knitted sweater.not great qualityThis is the only time I have ever had a problem with fake earrings.Have not rerded itemAlmost as secure as the Chrysmela Catch, but much lighter.I love these because they are not really heavier than a normal back and I trust my carat diamond studs with these.I am sticking with my Chrysmela Catch, twice the price but worth it, and actually the added weight on the back makes my larger studs stand up better in front.This product doesn't work.Pandora charms do not fit onto this bracelet.These are so softWore them all day today and they were so mfortable.I will be buying more patterns.Not a good productThis is Halloween stume quality at best and not worth the price.Delivery and Condition of Product: The packaging for these glasses was impressive and mparable to much higher end products.It mes with a beautiful travel case and glass cleaning wipes.The glasses themselves are vered up in plastic protection pieces to indicate they are handled with care.All other aspects of the glasses were in good shape.Fairly rugged design, feels solid.Entire hand assembly shifts when setting time, not accurate.It's just a piece of material stitched together.The quality and lor are not as I would have anticipated.so cheap basically plastic but great for Halloween stumesNo attention to detail.And it isn't fluffy at all (scratchy not soft.Not happy with this product at allRegular rain boots, not warm at all.Really surprised with the quality.The lor is diferent, the quality is not good, ir os to smallllllll Out of the package, fabric was nice stying was nice so I attempted to try it on.Product didn't match description, very thin in material, not flowing, very slinky.GaudyThere's also a strong dye odor.Not attractiveI have to wear a minimum of % tton because of an allergy.Pima Cotton is a high quality tton.I did not get my belt instead I got therapy putty.After a period of use scratch the lensLooks great on the model; on me, not so much.They are sparkly and pretty.This stuff that mes from China is super cheap in price and QUALITY.Washed my hands and the charm turned brown.Not the best product, but worked for a last minute purschase.The adhesive side didn't adhere properly, also there were no instructions or packaging.Beautiful little RING but of the stones fell out within hours.Don't buy these ear rings they are not silver.The fabric is not what I imagined and does not fit nicelyDid not like the fit or the fabric.It should have more structure and and the pocket should me out a lot more for it to work properly.It's just a basic t-shirt, nothing fancy at all.Completely see throughNot good quality.Don't buy from this mpany, it's not knitted, its nylon and short.I love this dress, its absolutely beautiful.great looking but was defective right out of the boxThis top is very, very, very sheer.it's printed with white plastic flowersbeautiful but you have to be a kid to wear it.It makes everything wavy right in the line of sight.It didn't hug' my frame as well as other maternity dresses.Absolute crap.Looked great and bought it.It's a one piece with footies.Was not a waist trainer" was just a material stomach girdle.Material was fine and fit as expected but not very flatteringI was very disappointed as the fabric was soft and stretchy and would have been a perfect summer dress.I really liked that they felt like the Breathable Bamboo Fiber Boxer Briefs with no fly and that the legs were a bit longer.After a single wash I noticed they shrunk but the waist band still felt mfortable enough to wear.Beautiful jewelry but not user friendly.Not quality materialit was a pleasant surprise and is truly gorgeous.Great bagBut hey at least they were warm?Yes they are soft yes they stay on, but what's the point if they themselves do what they're supposed to prevent .. Amazon customer service was great, as usualThe arm bands have some strange proprietary nnections to the watch body.The design was not the same as the picture.It's not worth your money trust me, you're better off buying a much cheaper, better quality item somewhere else.I've bought way better jewelry for cheaper but I guess you win some and lose others...This is the send pair of boxercraft pajama bottoms I've purchased and I'm not at all happy with the craftsmanshipI really wanted to like this swim suit because it has the sexiness of a two-piece and provides tummy verage.It may be cute with a belt and wboyboots, but i bought it for beachwear.Both top and bottomsIt only looks good in the picture.Spend the money and get something of better quality.It clings to your body, accentuating places you don't want it to like your stomach).Quality is fine but not so soft.It didn't look graceful at allThey do not kept your feet warmHad nice length and were mfortable.Don't buy this, unless you hate your ties, or love black rub marks on your ties.It's a very lovely, feminine looking blouse.Do not be seduced by these super cute but inexpensive - dare I say CHEAP dresses.The pj's were adorable and the quality seemed to be good, but they looked like a -yr-old's Didn't try to replace them.Unfortunately, it looks much better in the picture.I did not care for the abdominal mpression board.Band broke aftrr q minutes of wear.... Not happyI found out that the quality of the clothes are not that good.The fabric was also not great.It's not authentic Polo Ralph LaurenThe design is beautiful, but cannot be worn by the person it was ordered for.Terrrrible quality.The price is rediculously high for an item that u cant wash AND it gets tton balls on it after a few times of weari love this but it has the wrong neck line that i wanted.The fabric and lor was great.Buttons were ming off threads as well.It's NOT genuine leather, period.So you can get a better one same material at under US.Seemed sturdy enough, but doesn't last with daily use.The clasp broke in less than months.I ordered of these ties for my son to wear for his choir ncert.I wish I'd bought a tie locally, but unfortunately I didn't have time to go to the mall and thought these would be nice ties.He will be nice and warm but his arms will be freezing.In less than months, a diamond" fell out of each band.Aside from the fit, it is not the best fabric or nstruction.This dress was not well made.It seems good but it's very light and thinThere is no reason that it should be in this shape at this point.Beautiful bag.It feels sturdy and well made.I've ordered before and have received perfect dresses.Yeah you're thinking hey it's cheaper than the others.It looks like something you'd make at home for a third of the price.Not the best QuiltyThis mask does not allow enough room for the child's face in order to breathe properly.But its nice material, and silky soft.Not good productNOT WELL MADEI didn't expect high quality, but this thing is junk.I inevitably had to keep it and will likely gift it to a friend.Soft stretchy.Extremely mfortable.Cute but not practical.Pay a few more bucks for a higher quality shirt.I wasn't able to get it back on track again so it gaps open.The fabric is see through, I purchased it in white.Did not like qualityIt's a great design unfortunately I believe mine came with a faulty string, it came apart and of the rings broke, shame, will change review if seller follows up.Smells like motor oil.Its a lot of trouble time, once done its still not the desired look.DON'T BE FOOLED, DO NOT BUY IT no matter how pretty it looks on picture)Socks are ol, but there was a hole in one of the pairs.Luckily it wasn't expensive because i threw it away.I was looking for long time for this lor to match a ring, the look very pretty together and I loved them.To top that off, the triangles have absolutely no space between.If it vers what you need vered, then you're good to go.Maybe I can add lace here or there, but for now, it's just going to be regulated to bedroom romping.The fabric was not mfortableAbsolutely not like picture I have seen clothes for dolls with better quality and nstruction.Material things.awefulAweful qualityThere's no support in the bra.It does not flow like the photo.Gave it to my friend to use as a beach ver.I've noticed that over ten years with my wedding ring I have significantly worn down the gold I work in a hospital).I understand that some of you may say, what would you expect from stume jewelry?"LOOK AT THE DIMENSION CAREFULLYThe plugs in the individual bags are all bigger than the tapers included.Dreagal Women's Casual Drape Front Long Sleeve Knitted Cardigan Sweater.its not knitted.Not as good of fabric as it looksNot the quality it looksThe gloves are not waterproofand the pants is not adjustable for the inside.I was so looking for a warm pair of shoes for the winter, but these were not the answer.I didn't mind the ndition of the replacement used or new I just wanted a working item.Not a good quality bag.No elastic.The jacket is beautiful.mpletely see thruAnd the top stitching on the pink is in squares, not hearts.Sweet looking but can't wear it.Loved this shirt when i seen a picture of it.I bought it because it looked exactly like my Mar Hoffman tiger swimwear.I didn't expect much because of the price but I thought I uld at least wear it... no wayI plan to wear this as a summer ver up dress for the pool.Not good material.Super cute in the package though.This bracelet was cute in theory but in reality it's not mfortable to wear because of the way you have to attach it.Caviar emptor.This shirt was very disappointing I bought it in a triple XL it fits fine up top, but they must have made this for a man or a woman with no hips.I was super excited when I pulled these on because they were super mfortable.Then I did the bending over test in front of the mirror and holy WOW these are see-through.This dress did not meet my expectations.Quality is assThis is not a well made dress.I'm giving it to my neighbor who is taller and bigger to wear around her apartment.The shirt is good material however I am unable to pair them with the pants as I would like.This is not the product I received I do love the necklace, very pretty, has some weight to it.Not a chain that can be replaced easily, I imagine the pendant will do the same.Initial impression was fair value and a mfortable fit.From top of the side leg pocket to the hip pocket.Very cheep fabricCute but no lining in sleeves.But gorgeous piece.This product is trash, as well as the brand.Very huge lesson when you work So hard for your moneyIt does it's job, sort of big but it's mfy AN nice lookingThe lace at the bottom of the dress is very nice, but I can't say for the rest of the dress.If the dress was PROPERLY finished, it would look nice.Pictures are worth a thousand words.To start on a positive note, these are very warm.One lens was out when the package arrived.To Heavy, no zippers and the fabric doesn't have any give so to get into it is a hair raising experience.If they would of added inches it might of hit tunic territory, but I learned a lesson in buying knock off made in China dresses via this purchase.would not remmend it...not that satisfying nor quality nor fitdoes not hold well, buy earlifts insteadI loved the pictured dress i wish that is what i had received.Again, it will look great in pictures, but it's an expensive piece of plastic.Take your chances, buy some fabric from a craft store and try sewing your own outfit you would probably have more success.When you first receive it, it looks greatPretty and lorful.....I got his for my wife, within a week the charm had broken off never to be seen again.Don't adhere well.Description not accurate.The shirts are, in fact silk, and they are ol looking.Does not perform nearly as well as other tton no iron shirts.Not cute in person.the gray was beautiful fabric.Wasn't too happy uldn't use the dress.I purchased this for my son, in the children's size, to wear for a Disney outing.Don't see how this product can help, too much high waisted, didn't see any butt lifting effect at all.This hat is a medical device in that it is represented to protect the wearer from the dangers of sun exposure and the standards by which it is reviewed need be very high.Not as cute in person as pictureThis does not feel mfortable to wear for a long period of timeLove how it looks didn't get yetI thought it would be an actual sweater material it isn'tThe tongue rings have nickel in them.Was great at first, within a week the etching was nearly goneWell there really a nice design but the first day that I receive them I put them on and the ear backing came apart also I think they're a little more prettier in the pictures and they are in personNever going to buy expensive earrings again from amazon.I'd appreciate your prompt attention to this matter Thank you.Material is no goodDidn't feel very secure in it.There were snags in the material.QualitySeams were not rrectly sewed togetherSpend a little more money and get a real shirt.Not at allgoood quality.It was mfortable and exactly what I wanted if only it would stay upPleased with the appearance but not satisfied with the fact that I did not get much wear out of it.This product is not made very well.I knew when buying this shirt that based on the price it wouldn't be high quality but I expected it to artlessly not obviously be hand made.Not as shiny as they look.I didn't like the material of this dress and I returned itHave been through multiple wallets of similar form factor and most have been better than thisThe leather does seem to be very top notch materials though.The skirt by itself is absolutely beautifulIt feels and looks wonderful.They don't have the RB etched into the lense.And they smell like gasoline even after a few months of having themIt is ploy fill, I uld not feel one feather inside the jacket at allThat being said, the style, fabric workmanship was fairly good.Didn't like the material.men, this shape only works on man boobs, you really do have to test these on women before you market them.the satin vering on them is quite nice, and the loration is very nude.Not very ultrasonic.I should say I've had my piercing for almost years and had never had a single issue with it before I put these in.Be careful if you have sensitive skin.I don't often just flat out return something to Amazon.Smelled funny as well.Not maternity topsThe stitching was way off.On top of the way it is sewn it's not a flattering dress at all.I'm so disappointed because the dress is absolutely beautiful and would have been perfect for my event.Highly breakable looks ol for minutes until you sit down and it breaks because your thigh flexedMaybe my piercing was done weird, but uldn't fit it in my industrial, the anchor isn't adjustable so you have to hope it fits right.First the moon fell off the chain, which I thought would be an easy fix.The case is quite nicely made.The first dress I received was beautiful, quality material.Retains too much heat.Not protective against heat.mpletely see throughI thought it would be a nice light tony dress for the summer but it is heavy and has a heavy lining.Well I was very disappointed when I received the necklaces and they were not silverNot happy at all with this sweater.Also, material is not well made, similar to only wear once Halloween Costume material.Very scratchy.Halloween stumes are of better quality than this dress".Not happy with this item at allOn the upside it's very soft.The quality if the fabric is not worth the money.The length of the straps were mpletely different.We purchased a size -months two piece but when it arrived we had a -M bottom and a -M top.Quality not worth price.Looks better in photo.Two very thin, see thru layers, not flowy.It's a little too big for what I wanted and it definitely feels like PU leather rather than real genuine leather.I love the material and did not get a tan on my toes.It's green and scratched up, but it looked great when it arrived.I knew it wouldn't be great but thought it was something I uld work with to make look ok.Costume materialThe fabric is nice, it is well made.Looks nice but after wearing them for a only a half hour my feet feel like they are on fire its christmas eve and i have to leave the carnival to go home and change ill give it one star for the looksI have not worn this once.Also didn't like the feel of the material because it was stiff and super scratchy.Save your money for a better quality blouse.This bra doesn't hold together well at all.Not well madeClearly this is stume quality, but I would think I uld get one wear out if it.They did not feel tight but the crotch did not feel right I think that is where the problem lies.They uld be really good pants but something with the way they are sewn does not fit right nor does it allow the material to stretch as needed.BeautifulI no longer wear it.Expected better quality for the money.NOT Waterproof.Kit very small too small to hold if you have large hands applicator tore first time used would not remmend this to anyone who wants to give a good polish to shoes Good idea that wasn't executed well, these don't work.I've actually gotten some nicer glasses at the dollar store.the top is simply a sash so im sure you know that it has NO PADDINGmy nipples are erect most of the time and they are seen through the yellow and green fabric.i won't use this service again due to quality.It looks as cheap as it fits and feels.When I received two weeks ago I was excited as it was just the style I want.I hand washed for at least three time using detergent or soap bar, but the smell was still strong.I then kept it in water overnight, but the next day the strong smell was still there.The material is not stretchy like a tee should be.I expected better from Samsonite.I won't be buying any suitcase with spinner wheels again.I bought belt accessories and everything trying to make this thing work... just don't do it.AND NOTHING THIS UGLY WAS WORN BY ANYONE ON THE FAST FURIOUS" SERIES.The quality of this item is mpletely reflected in that cheap price.not a great quality even for the looks onlyThis is not a Simply Southern shirt.This hat has little in the way of quality ntrol.The top does not lay nicely on the chest as depicted in the picture.They're beautiful, but they are now permanent.Sewing was a mess.Bought the same swim suit in a different lor from a different seller and it was excellent quality.Material is not so great either but the designs are very cuteSo so in reality.Cotton is soft.I questioned myself when buying these but I thought they'd be mfortable for yard work and just laying around the house.I washed them a few times in hopes they would relax and tried my best at shrinking them.Not happy with product the weight was heavy and unmfortable The picture on the website did not represent the true quality.Not well made and definitely not a new product.Beautiful shirt thoOther than that the product looks good and came in a nice travel bag.The necklace is very heavy.Nice shirt and material for the moneyIt looks like a nice pale sea foam greenish/ teal, like a pastel right?Catchy material.Loved but Brooke First time I usedThere are no pearls on it, rather it's a shiny metal a little heavier than tin) mimicking rhinestones.They looked much better in the picture.Its just not attractive to me./ this umbrella did not get a lot of use until this week when it rained a lot in the east ast.Don't buy if you want REAL Fluffies....The diaper ver and cardigan were ok.Spent my money on it just to give it away and repaint it for someone, then bought myself a perfect one.Quality was ok, nothing to mplain on quality or performance.I purchased this about years ago and it looked great at first.I don't know when this happened but i had a Arena for years and never a hole or disloration.I've gotten dressed cheap with better quality.Came apart at the seams the fist time I wore it had to give it one star so I uld write this review would not remmend this not worth the stampThe necklace was very inexpensive looking so I chose not to wear it.Because to tide on the legs.Nice if you're a pin head.Looked really nice but a piece inside fell off into the watch itself.It's not even close to its photo and it's super super scratchy.I did receive tons of mpliments on it, but unfortunately it is poorly madeI had another one like this I bought off Amazon two years ago, but that one was good quality, and this is garbage.One final note- if this is a tighter fit on you, it shows every little imperfection.On the plus side, it's really soft and mfortable.I agree with crystals mment.It smells like clothes at least otherwise it's trash maybe a good night time sweater for when I feel like sleeping dress as Bill Cosby.The material is like a ballerina dance outfit Makes it not wearable to work for me.I loved this bracelet...The earrings are on fish hook type holders so there is NO WAY to wear them along the ear the way picture shows.They are also not very sparkly like in the picture.I rather pay more to get the good quality Printing is of high quality and looks to be sublimation.There is padding in the top but the deep v would require a special bra or going without.Do not like the quality of this license plate.The fabric.It's more of a black and peach.I guess it is the material.This is a shame because the purse itself is nice and I would really like to love it.It looks nice, is roomy, has good pockets, but the odor is just too overwhelming.When I took it out on the water it quickly stopped working even though it had only gotten wet a few times over the urse of an hour, so it's definitely not waterproof.Looks great on her though.Really was laughable.Scratchy.The material isn't very thick so white is extremely see-through but I guess I should've expected that since it's white.I purchased for a Pebble Steel, width is right but I can't use the band since it only uses a standard stem to mount properly.But non the less very annoying that I can't use itThreads everywhere.So far I have not had any wind when I used the umbrella.Update: the latch to close the umbrella started not working very well about a month ago and today it broke.SO it's hanging in my closet with the rest of Amazon purchases that don't fit, that i uldn't return or get credited back on.too much material at the top as if it was not sewn propertlyIt looks great on her.I'm sorry but how is that stylish??Now that I have had a chance to wear some of them, I have an educated opinion.Which is fine other then it's horrible material as wellThe fabric is a men's boxers material or a Walmart's knitted t-shirt that holds up to a wash only) NOT a classy dress fabric.Smells like burlap.Think rich yet dark.Very mfy.The feel of being in PJ's yet you look cute.More like a regular stretchy soft tton.The pouch isn't sewn on all the way.Very pretty but absolutely will not stay in place with either earring backs provided.The only reason I kept them is because I needed hats for my daughter's Easter hat project.Doesn't live up to the picture.The picture looks much more elegant than the real thing.The glasses are dark, which I love.The arms have a rubber type finish on them, for grip, I am assuming.I looked out my window with them on, worked great.Check out my photos, I did my best to document them.It's a stretchy knit fabric, so it's super mfortable.Absolutely GORGEOUS, but within hours, the stone at the bottom had me off.Pay alittle more for quality.Yuck.....not as nice as pictured.....Should be priced . not . not a good investmentArrived with scratches.These shoes are not mfortable at all, with no arch support.Its not very sturdy..flimsy in fact but fans will love it.My husband loved them but they broke with little ntact from a chihuahua lbs).These are my favorites--but the send one out of the box had a huge hole in itDO NOT BUY THESE CLIPS IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON USING THEM.BY the time it wraps around the metal piece it's lucky it would fit a child.Really short not great quality (Nice leather.This shirt is not an authentic Simply Southern shirt.It is not a tton t shirt.Nice lor, thin material, some strings hanging..The edges of the dress are made out of a tton t-shirt type of material that does not mesh well with the dress.Material is not really bathing suit quality.This looks great, but the temple arms fell off in less than a week.Not good metalThe band is fully synthetic.Fake leatherI was expecting something soft and tton.It's not real leather and it's like a cardboard for the card holders.Not real glass.Ill-fitting and totally sheerbut not nearly enough space for full grown men.I'm not happy with this itemGood looking watch...but I'm all about efficiency and functionalityWhat a disappointment, it looks so nice in the pic such a great price.The top was fine, but the straps are not adjustable, so you are stuck if you needed more support from a shorter strap.It was more stripper pole than daywearBathing suit material not what I expectedThis is not a choker.It's not as shiny as I expected.Looks so pretty on Amazon but was a great dissappointment.There was absolutely no upper body support.this is nice productNice lace at the topLooks a lot different then the picture.I got the red two piece set..Horrible quality, see through, way too small, do NOT buy this productThe low price is definitely an indication of the quality.Ultra sheer.Save yourself the troubles and hassle I had to deal with as the glasses are simply not usable.This was not a good puchase and would NOT remmend.Magnet for money clip is two week to hold more than two bills down and I would trust it to stay with a buck in it.Comfy, but has a run the send I put them on.maybe i will add lace or something to make it longer.sleeves are butterfly style(no seam-the pieces lap over each other).Material is a shiny yucky polyester material.This choker is super cheap quality for .It feels and looks like the same quality of a Halloween stum.This dress is lovely in the pictures.Other than this detail it showed up as expected, length is perfect, but I can't wear it, I'm only in a c cup and I purchased a large great everywhere else...Not sewn rrectly at all.It should be to the floor.Beautiful piece but disappointed with the quality had to buy a send set because I feared it wouldn't stay together for more then one wear.Bought these for a wedding and needed to be sure I had the full set.Beautiful but the beads fell out the moment I clipped it in my hairIt was not leather and it has a strong plastic smell.It would have been perfect without the stains and the shine.I did not like the material i expected.I was not happy with this outfitThe rings you see are metal and very heavyI should have known better being that the model's head is cut off clearly this is someone elses pic that they are using....The chinese designer did not mimic/recreate this piece well at allVery cheap, very unmfortable plus not as large as I would like..These pajamas are very cute until you wash them.Did not like the quality of the dress at all.It's very thin and the jewel is not easily regnized as a heart shape.Do not purchase if you nsider yourself thick.Product had visible mold on the front when it arrived in its clear packaging envelope.The sweater was not made well at all.The was a hole in the stitching where the tag is located.Details stated tton and it isn't.Both my husband and I uldn't figure out how to set.My daughter loved the way it looked but uldn't set the watch for her to use.My toddler loves these boots from an aesthetic standpoint and loves to wear them in rain and snow.Cute ncept and my toddler does love them, but mom wishes there was a little more quality ntrol on waterproofing these rubber boots for wet nditions.Sewn VERY VERY POURLYWhen I received this dress days before wedding and tried on it for fine top from bust to shoulders was a lot bigger extra lace materialSo my husband got his pliers and was able to zip it that wayRidiculous time I have wasted and wasn't able to wear it at the occasion I wanted, very sad.These socks are no warmer than any of my other socks.Made with sub par material.No give in the material at all.Otherwise these are some excellent, eye catching bootsI was hoping for a much better quality product and fabric.After just a few washes on gentle wash, and gentle, low-temperature dry these are already ready to be donated.It does state it's woven.s***ty product honestly.Then the tool to adjust the size broke before we truly got to use it.the material does not breathe and you have to be tiny to for this to fit mfortableOriginally I loved these and thought they were great when I used them for my daughter.Maybe they have changed the type of material or the type of velcro.Washed it once, air dry, and now it fits kind of) the year old neighbor girl.It was not a Simply Southern shirtThese panties looked very nice.The shoes are nice but the quality isn't.After my husband misplaced his wedding band, we needed a replacement band quickly and at a good price.It uld be way better quality for what people are having to pay.It's a good thing my mother is a wig shaping pro.I received this product at a disunt in exchange for my honest opinion.It was very clearly made in China.I ordered this luggage set because I thought it was durable material.Lens popped out after about minutes wearing them, won't properly fit back in.I bought this tank top, and when it FINALLY was delivered I put it on and it was a crop top on me.Cute pattern, ok material for the price.Does work as waterproof but Touch ID needs improvement as well as quality of clear screens seems like plastic wrapDo not buy if you have sensitive earsIt's too hotAlso the fabric doesn't have a good quality.It isn't a long sweater at allGiven the price of this robe one would think it would be awesome.Sure was beautiful the first day I wore it.I uld have done a better fake at home with my printer.Not happy with this bracelet.It was very beautiful and all but unfortunately I uldn't find a way to close it.It is not made to last long.The charm is very tiny and the necklace too short this is a perfect gift for a kidI had looked at several other rsage bracelets this looked the prettiest w/ the best reviews.The metal piece can be taken off fairly easily, but then you have to re-tie the ribbons to the clear plate, which takes extra time.This dress is very pretty, and looks exactly like the pictureVery cheaply made and definitely not worth the price.I do think this is a pricey wallet and expect the craftsmanship and quality to reflect that, and it did not.The material is very then, therefore it shows everything.It is very cute, but doesn't do me any good since it almost ripped with me just trying to put it on.not good qualityI have bought inexpensive bags and they have lasted years, so it is not what I expected.Send is the quality.That was very much appreciated.Not mfortableI purchased these rainboots October th, and after only weeks of normal wear (my daughter has worn them times total since receiving them) they have a small hole in the side of the bootTook piercing out put normal metal one back in and already feels better.Very soft but no room for testicles.The material was to be as expected.If it were a better material it might have fit better.I love these items.the diamond was not sparkling Too high waisted almost under sports bra and not flattering to the booty at all.It had loose pieces that made no sense.Earrings did not match at all.one piece thick stretch materialChinese junkThe product looks good but does not last.The star is for the material quality.Material is good and mfy.The material is good and it is well made.Since I spent the money I just wear it around the house, but still no difference at all.I don't know how they make this look good in the photos.I have a few of the Out of Print T-shirts and they all fit as expected and are great quality.Dress is mpletely see through.Low st but low quality I wouldn't purchase from the mpany again too many quality alternatives.Can find better quality in disunt retail stores.I know it looks different on every body type, but it is so deceiving.It's was missing a part so uldn't use it in the process of returning it) and it looks a lot more tacky in real life.I was getting it as a gift but the quality doesn't look great.It looks better in pictures.The material gathers static so if you live in a dry climate, skit it.Not at all soft sock material.They were mfy and perfect for my outfit but got a hole in the left glove by the thumb within a hour of wearing them.For something that was originally marketed at almost , you would expect better quality.Looks so much better in the pictureLovely design BUT I wear max American and this item XXL is too small to sleep in and the fabric is too stiff for mfort.An very expensive handbag.When the bracelet arrived, beads from the petals were off of it.And it did not look flattering.Even if it looked and fit great the material was so u enjoyable and seemed like it would be really hot even though it's a tan top.Looks like it should have more spandex and better quality.So my star is for the item being delivered on time.is not fresh water pearls, they are plastic, they charge ..I so excited when I receive, but in one month is broken, very bad material.I received the wrong glasses, and when I got the wrong ones I uld see that the nstruction these was only ok.Pretty for stume jewelry.The lors have smeared as well.Wrinkles easily, very thin, very unpleasant on the skin shower curtain, remember dress not lined.Not a good quality it feels like very thin plastic and breakable.I sent it back it wasn't true to size and material wasn't accurate as seen in pictureIt's beautiful and has great meaning, but it smells STRONGLY... like petroleum; some kind of chemical... perhaps some gasy poison.Surprisingly, with the materials it seems to be made of, I uld not shape it after steaming it, and I've been steaming and shaping hats for many years.Garment did not look nice afterwards.Nice looking shirts, will be giving as gifts.The fabric, if you can call it that, is very cheap feeling and is definitely not soft.very very strong odor factory)I have used them once for spinning-I'm more mfortable in my regular sneakers.I want to repurchase but I won't because of the quality.The material very fragile.The necklace wouldn't hold on place for a sendHad to pay to fix the lock and jeweler touched up faded gold.It will be a mfy although unattractive sleep shirt.Not a great investment.The front tie looks nice pictures, but in real life it's awkward.It is soft though.These were a fuzzy mess Would not remmend My dryer and vent were full of fuzzI have a similar one in lime green, and the quality mpared to this one is night and day.I received a bra that I can not wear not a shirtWith white panels on the front and back, I will not feel mfortable wearing them in public.Both bra straps were fully exposed.Would not remmend, not even for the price.I'm not sure what they where fitting this to when designing it.they do not look good on...PLEASE NOTE THIS SCARF IS % ACRYLIC not tton or wool at all.Material was on and so was stitching.I've been wanting this item for a long time, but thought it was a bit pricy for fake pearls.Long strings they left hanging.No lining on the inside.It is not nearly as long and flowing and brick" as pictured.Fabric is not what I expectedThe shape and appearance of this bag is greatI love the bag designBack to fossil for meManly looking.These glasses are cute, but you can't wear them on a sunny day.Avoid at all sts.But the fabric on this black one was totally different.Definitely not a ready to use without worry product.The attached photo speaks for itself it was taken about hours after we first noticed the injury, so it's definitely not just some kind of sleep mark").The fabric is chiffon and true to Asian sizes.These are beautiful but didn't look good in the ear.Not good for warmth.Nothing more annoying than socks falling under your heel in your shoe.They changed the design, the lors and the quality of the fabric used but still show the old picture of the underwear that is no longer accurate.The fabric used to be thicker and softer and very good quality.I have purchase better quality belts from Dollar General for bucksBut the fabric is gorgeous.Would have been nice if it was kind of stretchy but that's okay.But it is so well designed though It smelled like real leather, too.I don't understand how these work, but they're not as depicted.Chain is cheap, breaks easily, and not worth I re-purchased a higher quality suit and love it.Too bad seemed like nice fabric and lor.The material on the inside looked very cheap, the outside material was nice though.Not cute, not sexy... not even pretty for that matterYou're better off asking your gramma for a crochet table cloth, cut some holes for your arms and you're good to gocheep material.The lour was technically accurate, but that's about it.Picture shows a textured material beautiful jacket.Bags wee reasonable priced.The model looks well endowed but in this top, everybody would be able to see everything she's got.It doesn't show that the style in the back is a racerback.The blanket is not worth let alone the + that I paid for it.Thought I would like and wear it but it looks cheap and I have never worn it out.This is not a Woman's" Shirt.The upside, they are mfortable but I don't believe they will last.Not quality fabric.New Balance needs to listen.The belt has good quality.It's only been a month and it's already broken and I'm NOT pleasedAnd the quality is horrendousThe material is not what I expected.Not a single tag on it for care instructions.The sunglass not for sun glass not a good quality jacket at allMy chest was bursting out of the buttons.This shirt is another that uld take some added quality ntrol.I lost one already./ And it takes forever to get to the breasts when your baby is crying for milk.This item is more for a year old teen girl not as the item describe for a woman's, its not elegant at allThere are better pieces of clothing out there.Fitted as expected, material was mpletely off.% acrylic.I've had good luck with some of these inexpensive sweaters on Amazon.These are cute and durable but they are NOT a INFANT.These are not made of soft tton" they are some kind of synthetic stretchy fabric.These earrings do not want like they are shown to wear.I do not have a large chest, even while breastfeeding, but I did not find they were supportive enough to wear without a bra.Great if you want to just scare sometime, a short use.The pattern is ol, got it to go with my husband's lavender shirt.The material is not as it appears.It was not sheer and cute like in the picture.The lobster clasp does not work well.Not what I expected, the material is a soft foam.And they don't look right as drop earrings.The Wings were nice, despite one being broken.In my opinion not worth the price, and the only positive I uld give it were the wings that looked incredible but like I said were broken.Material is okay.Looked like old pajamas from back in the day ' I wish I uld give no stars Quality is good but size not great.Received dress with holes/runs through the yarn.Although the price is very cheap, it definitely doesn't look like the quality of the one advertised.Was also a little expensive for what we thought we ordered.You can get a better and cheaper romper of way better quality at the store for less then .i didn't like it looks like a pijamaThis turtleneck is nice material BUT the length of the turtleneck is way to SHORTThe picture of this model had to be photoshop" around the hips.Not happy with the neck.Conceptually a good idea.Not for my babies.. they did not enjoy wearing these.I got this purse and was happy with its overall appearance and the face that it had a matching wallet.The material is mesh.& the shirt is too tight to make layering realistic.Not what I expected at all, cute in picture, not in real life.It is a beautiful design and classy.The elastic is loose and the other reviewer is right, the shorts are like gym shorts.:( He has worn them for days, no water/rain and plugged them in to charge every night.I live in yoga clothes.I have tons of lored yoga capris and love almost all of them.You can tell from the picture below the long piece has absolutely no gold leftGood product, well made.THE GLOVES ARE BEAUTIFUL AND BEFORE I ORDERED I READ REVIEWS BUT IT DID NOT FIT.I know that these aren't the Hope diamond, or from Tiffany's, but I at LEAST wanted them to sparkle for her.Had a pungent petroleum smell that was overwhelming.It is as if it was glued together when it wasn't lined up properly.Material is cheesy and the print does not look as nice as in the picture.its adorable but pants are see through.quality of clothing not the best.The gem is very cloudy.Meticulously rinsed after each use.Do not waste your money, better quality exists just pay more and you will find a better watchSuper cheap looking jumper but very good service.Great looking bag which I got many mpliments on.This bag has zero padding with the exception of the divider and st me . in repairs.This bag isn't made to last and doesn't offer good protection.Too bad, because they got the aesthetics right.The picture is gold and I got mailed a silver necklace.Love the logo, and great qualityThe material was not at all what I expected it to be.The tail piece is just attached not part of the pouch part, so ignore the dimensions if you want something to fit inside.This photo show what I have receive.I love the look of gorjana jewelry and this bracelet was no exception.Chepa materialIt would be a beautiful shirt if it didn't have those tacky looking jewels on the front.The sleeves are beautiful and good quality.It was quite inexpensive, so I wasn't expecting great quality but this was not worth the purchaseSeems like OK quality.Had an aweful chemical smell.I am a b on top but as a tie back it fits fine.Quality has gone way down.I bought this product thinking it was mfortable.was not properly madeThis bag came nicely wrapped, but does not appear to be leather.I wasn't expecting a very high quality piece, but I WAS expecting it to be non-defective at minimum.The description picture is not accurate.Bag is a replica don't buyMagnets did not stay clasped well enough for him to wear them.Don't buy it if you need gold none of your gold jewelry will match it.If you want your boobs to look like sad and floppy balloons within a cheaply made, synthetic and foul smelling vest," then this is an excellent product for you.The picture gives it a soft thin sweater type vibe.It's very see through and the beading around the neck is not mfortable.I have sensitive skin and it makes my neck and shoulders very red within minutes of wearing.The wood seems like a good idea, but it has no flex.material is not very goodUpon arrival it wasn't the quality that I wanted, just as I thought.Yes the faux shearling is soft but it is fake end cheap as well.I know they are not real gold but I hoped to get more wear timeNot great quality and doesn't match the picture exactly.Really nice well made belt.This waterproof" jacket is most certainty not waterproof.Nice stylish watch.I my opinion, the price of this Shirt can be dollar at most.Cool looking shoes but not mfortable at all.Definitely cheaper quality.Has the tiered necklace that I was looking for.I am pretty sure it will turn my neck green and will break if a breeze of wind touches it.They tarnished almost immediately... Not happyPicture looks far better than product received.Received this item today.That was made in ChinaThe flash bolt edges are extremely sharpBetter off using Mission Belts which last longer and are better quality.Does not have the lining as shown in the picture.The necklace looks like I bought it for my GRANDDAUGHTERStitching under one armpit was not rrect and had strings hanging from it.This product is not made of leather.Material doesn't really form to the shape, maybe I bought it too small but it didn't really look good.Some dude hand made in China.This product needs work.That might work if you bought it off a hanger, but cramming it in a box bent the wire out of shape and we uldn't get it to look nice.The lor was nice and thin material.The material is deceiving from the eye online but in person has the material of synthetic rain at.I wouldn't even have taken off for that, cause I bought it with the intent to wear around the house, on hot days.I don't like quality.ink washed off in first washThe stitching looks like it was done by a year old.Whole Bracelet is very light I don't think it's s plated with gold or Platinum.Where is the laser lettering of Swarovski Zirnia" On the stones.Product is shiny, as if were patented leather..Product was returned for replacement with proper fit.Would have been perfect for my daughter's wedding.Do not order from this site it's in predictable.Lovely.This is not a blanketNOT a ladies cut racer-back tank at all.I am not happy with this item at all.A little to much for my taste, not enough attention to detail.Lovely and an eye catcher....all of that is true until the silver rubs offNot a quality product.Not warm.It he strap keeps on falling off purse, and it end up on the floor.. Don't feel mfortable with my gun in this purse.It wasn't good quality at all.They are very nice sandals but they are heavy on your feet when you walk and it feels like you have weights on your feet...I totally wish I never got them..Not sweater materialVery synthetic and not good quality.mpletely see through.very delicateBy the first look when it arrived It iwas not impressive.I'll have to do hot yoga for three days straight to fit into these.The quality is %.This bag was smaller than anticipated and made with cheaper materials because when I picked up the box, it felt like I was only picking up the weight of the box.In addition, there was a large crease on the back of the back that would not smooth out.I am more of a simple person and likes the plain look of the headbands and received something mpletely different.The quality of the headband I received is fine, its just not the product described in the listing.I wore this for days and the gems came out of the halo.Don't buy these pants...terrible qualityI ended up giving away... it was also too expensive for the quality I recieved.Very cheaply made as well, I definitely do not remmend.Comfortable, but after uses the bottom did not hold up.I had to return mines because the quality of the dress was not what I had expected.I thought it was going to have more of a khaki thicker quality feel to it but I guess I didn't pay too close of a attention to the product details.They are not mfortable at all.Fabric is not nice and didn't fit properlyNot put together very well.I bought months size for my months son..but it was too tight on him and we can see the elastic marks on his body if he wears it too long.Shirt is nice quality and bottoms probably are too - guessing it is a fluke as they seem high quality otherwise.Hair ties do not stay on these.Wasn't the material listed in the descriptionPackaging was beautiful and I anticipated an equally impressive product.I hate buying inexpensive bags for this very reason- they don't lastLooked good, Magnetic clasp is strong.Now a cat toy.If you are looking for any quality at all I do not suggest this bag.The item is clearly not a four leaf clover nor is it dried flowers.Not good quality...no tags...no labelsYou need to get into a different line of work.OK for the price, BUT % polyester % tton does not= a wool hat.Was only worn once.Made of styrofoam.Not time label them under clothesIt's a beautiful ring but stones got out and lost within month.Didn't like the quality so gave it to Goodwill.I like the design of the shirt and the material is okay, but I ordered this for my husband and the shirt I received is not an adult shirt.The scrip is not enough clear.it looks prettier in the picture.Its sleek and the material is smooth.Beautiful lining on the inside thats about it.Does not have design on back doesn't hang well also not long enoughThis looks like two pieces but is one not made good at all.Also the material is more tent' like and not mfy at all.The picture did not show gold on the bag.Great shoe but not made of the rrect material at all.The fabric I received was an orange like lored leopard print MICROFIBER.The black agate amethyst were pretty good but the Rose Quartz was not.The Rose Quartz is the main reason I bought this set of plugs.The diamond stud fell out within mere hours of wearing.Fabric didn't lay well.Wow these are so see through that I uld my thong not an outline, but the actual thong.My pair was very mfy and I was excited about them but as I was heading out the door my fiance noticed and told me to look in the mirror in the light.I don't like the material at all (..Arrived in pieces.Definitely not made for tall girls.The ncept of this swimsuit is nice but the execution fails to work for my female body.I did not receive it got the quatz but not the fossilsThank you for the broken product (Clothes quality isn't goodThe nstruction of the product just screams cheap with the mechanisms not being sturdy at all, it makes a noise it should not make and I know this will not last very long.Better off getting the more expensive alternatives on Amazon.Way too bright for my taste.BEWARE MATERIAL IS WAAAAY TOO THIN TO WEAR THESE WITHOUT COVER YOUR PRIVATE AREASWAYYYYYYYYY too expensive...While this is a beautiful top...The price is fair nsidering the quality.It would've worked better as a shirt(maybe).Shirt not as pictured; its definitely not classy.It seems as though the stitching is made with cheapish materiel but I love the design and would love another non-ripped pair to show off and wash by hand this time.This is NOT a good product.If the product weren't defective it would be perfect.Beautiful design but runs smallGives you a pop belly.While the material is soft and silky it is transparent.The zippers on this purse are all send rate and do not zip well.I had bought this dress for my daughter's wedding, and I uld not wear itThe material feels nice and the style and lour was as shown in the picture.The quality though was not good.I've had this for less than hours and it already broke.The top is very beautiful nicely made.That is why it gets star quality is great.Looking for a mostly natural tton sock, I tried Amazons most promising brands, all to fit size Europe ) shoe.For the same price, per pair, the Flora and Fred sock shown in the center of the photo is much better made.The sock on the right is from the per pair the organic tton and bamboo socks from Eable which have a soft, substantial feel.Too tight and material is not goodI love this shirt but the quality of it isn't so good.The fit was perfect but quality isn't up to my standardsThis mpany must have no quality ntrol standards.There is no lining beneath the lace area in the top, the back is sheer, and the skirt is fully see-throughI bought pairs of these sunglasses for my daughters they looked great and both girls were thrilled until the glasses broke less than months after receiving them.Did not work once receivedI did enjoy the squirrel on the front, but the material wasn't mfy to wear for long periods of time.All the numbers on the outer ring rubbed off within days and now it's just a watch.It isn't mfortable to wear.it is totally and mpletely wrong in every way.I thought this pair would be great because there was extra padding.I switched inserts to Superfeet with maximum heal support Plantar Fasciitis is slowly getting better.The bar may be of the right non-allergenic material, but the jeweled piece itself is not.Too big for my taste.Material is super see throughBeautiful and I'm sure on a very very thin woman it would look great.Looks nice by the way, just doesn't function as it shouldI was so in love with this bag.The fabric is not durable.I am sure for some its not a huge deal, but I don't feel mfortable at the gym working out in a see through top.THIS IS THE THIRD ITEM I BOUGHT FROM CHINA THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLEI had to string and put togetherThese glass had great potential.They look so much nicer in the picture than they really are.I know it's cheap but I still don't feel like I got my money's worth.Much better in picture then in person.Looks nice but had a few stones missingBeautiful soft fabric,but...this is not plus sizeI need a tiny ring like this clitoral piercing) lor everything.I used tweezers, a piercing clamp; everything under the sun.I've had this piercing for years plus-- never has such a problem with jewlery.Very nice material and style otherwise.Too much rayon and not enough tton so not very flattering.this item should not be listed as quartz.it is man made glass..It was a solid black shirt.....The print on the shirt was not good quality either.I ordered this in g and absolutely loved it it slipped right in, was easy to click on and off, and was aesthetically pleasing.I can not give this necklace good reviews because after I wore it a uple of times it broke on me.Not mfortable at all.I donated them to a very short woman.I would not remmend getting these and I should have looked where they are made After numerous adjustments she still wasn't able to get them to lock without help.The magnets picked up every small piece of metal she came across while playing.Products seems to be legit but they are great knock off.Maybe it would work with jeans but I haven't tried it bc that's not what I needed it for.The locks didn't work properly for meThis product does not have the sparkle or shine that it does in the picture.My suggestion is fine a different brand that sizes them rrectly.Not wrinkle free, looks nice, but not good quality and shrinks.The details of the dress are not as pictured.Not attractive.I don't like was diferent picture weeks age i really no remmendNice style and fabric and I love white.Great fabric BUT even with ordering the next size up for all my boys sizes, , , and ) all three were too small on top.There is no draw string or adjustable closure.They would be a great buy if they lasted even the full summer.The shoulder straps are not adjustable.There is absolutely no support.well, if you are expecting the papery chiffon that looks light and airy, forget it.It was humongous.Definitely buy this if you wear very wide, and I mean WIDE, glasses.I bought it to keep me warm and it certainly will notBut not mfortable, and wouldn't buy again.The item did not match the picture in terms of fit or material.made very nice,,but uld not make out the picture on it,,will not order againThe material was not good quality.Not the same as picture bad material fits good but the armpits of the shirt stuck out to far not well made at allNot the best gift idea.Might work better with a bale made of the same material?Its a clear stone.One look at the package I knew they got it from them, and resold these for more, which would be fine, if they had fit.I saw these necklaces and thought it would be a great way to remind them about the fun they had that day.I know they were cheap, but I at LEAST wanted what I orderedThe fluffy material inside is folded and overlaps in front, which takes up some of the room needed for glasses.The appeal was the assortment of lors, but what good is that when the quality is lacking?I had previously bought the Home-X glasses holder for myself and it is beautifully made.They know how to make the bottom neatly.Everything in it was out of proportion.First at least of the butterflies wouldn't lay flat and I wore it for less than a week and with slightest bit of tension it broke.GLASSImagine wetSmelled like mildewMy most expensive and unmfortable shoes I own..And my Adult daughter is very careful with her jewelry.Not sewn well.Pockets aren't square and are rippled.Great quality and price.Belt stained my brand new khaki pants.Beautiful RingNo elastic to help it fit SEE Through materialThe style was absolutely not matching my expectationsShiny polyester fabric.Sewed it because needed that next day.glasses aren't working upon arrival.It's a cheesy, slick fabric with a photo of rivets placed on the fabricAVOID THIS PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS I have jeans thicker than what was shipped to me Notbof good quality, lor change.It's much more shiny than I expected from the photos.So I can't wind it, I can only set it.Made my husband look so cheesy I asked him to take it off and not wear it to the event.The ones I have received after being fully charged for hours prior to use can barely be seen from - feet away.These lights did nothing to enhance the fact that I was out there in the dark.Maybe Generation will be brighter and better.Cute at first sight.Spend a few buck more at prana or athletaI know it's only but there are some decent quality shirts made for .The weight and the length of the scarf was good though.The material isn't great quality either.This product wasn't at all I expected.COMPLETELY SEE THROUGHAdhesive was good, but if you're anything over a B, do not buyDoesn't stay latched.We tried to figure out how the strings on the top work.This dress is a lot longer than all my summer dresses.The watch was nice for a few weeks, but then broke.If you're looking for a cheap plastic too small garment this is perfect.Material is very scratchy.For pants that are , I'd expect them to have high performance material.This was an inexpensive but attractive bracelet.Unfortunately it arrived broken and I need to return it and have it replaced.It is not a smooth leather and had dirt and smudges before I even received it.One of the pendants was fine.The other had some type of white film inside of the glass and was a mplete write off.Great dress but I'll only be able to wear it around the house (Cinching yourself in and hoping the crepe tie stays tied is your only assurance the dress stays on.I have never written a review before, however the poor quality of this product has motivated me to write one so others will have a better understanding.Loved the style.Weird material, not loose, or mfortable, definitely not for someone bigger than a mfortable medium.The fabric is super cute and soft, and the design is cute in theory).It's huge and offers absolutely no support.Very soft but not worth the money.I don't know if mine is just pierced up to high or what but this doesn't work at all for me.The mesh fabric on the back is not even trimmed neatly.I purchased these glasses more as an experiment to see if they had the same dimensions of the Oakley Holbrook.As a stand alone review without the influence of a pair of Oakley's these are ok but the narrowness ntinue to challenge longer term wearability.No elasticity to them.They are too tight around the calfs for me, leave a mark on the calf, a rough weave not very soft and a little loose in the foot.This is a beautiful bag but I have only had the bag a month and the stitching is ming apart on the inside.This was an expensive bag.Not very mfortable.These were inexpensive, I know, but shouldn't they last more than a few months?After several days of restitching I gave up and just carried it without straps.Beautiful ring tho.Not quality jewelryIt doesn't have polo tags all it is a white tshirt.I am a private school teacher so I like to look well put together without spending outside my means.These ties look a lot better online than they do in person, which surprised me because I bought the PL of the same brand and it looks stellarWhen you walk, it wobbles and doesn't stay in place.I had to cut a good piece of it.Invest some extra money in something more solid.If you want a hat that you chase all over the place, this is the hat for you.sewn on the knee"in a hurry,maybe Chinese women,quality of evil,thankyouOther than that, the sweatshirt is good quality and looks warm.I would love to work with the seller if possible to see if we can fix this issue because I really do love the fit of these leggingsMaterial was good for the price of the robe.The necklace design is STUNNING.I LOVE the layering.Fits like a pumpkin and you can sneak your friends into the movie theatre under the tarp they're calling a dress.The only good thing about this dress is that it's water resistant.It's cute but not good quality.The quality was not great..Fit was fine, fabric quality was absolute s***.I expected higher quality for the st.It was full of static.These stretch out, and do not return to the expected fit after washing.The quality Sewing is good all around.I don't know because there's no tag, but it's super stretchy and shiny like work out clothes.I thought it would be a soft tton, but nah.And they are symmetricalThe charm itself is as pictured.this is not knitted at all.Does not fall well like in the pictures either and the sleeves are not long enough.Not at all luxurious like the picture.Din't like materialNot denim waiter.It has strings in the front hanging strings in the back hanging I ordered an extra large it fits like a small it looks nothing like it's described please do not order the dress at all under any circumstancesThe material is not suitable for anything, much less clothing.Plus it is mpletely see through.sizing is off and not good quality.Looks much better in the picture.Feeling of fabric not good.Not mfortable to wearI bought these headbands when my baby was a newborn ...she is almost months now and still won't fit her.Next, is the material.The picture makes it look like a high quality tton or even a satin.What about fabric quality, and over all appearance of the shrug.It says tton blend but it's more like a shiny polyester.It was mpletely see throughVery delicateIt's so disappointing really, I loved the jacket itself, the fur looks great too.see through material that isn't seen stretchy or mfortable.I love the shirt.Maiden was Crawford.I had the at air out for days and still has that smell.However, these are less annoying to me than the fading.Water spots are a big problem- why?The old slouch socks were soft and wide.It's so beautiful BUT it was missing diamonds on arrival.... so upsetting....Right out of the package was an oppressive chemical smell that was unbelievably strong.Whatever ink is being used to dye these leggings is not anything I'd want on my skinInside of the hat is soft and warm.I am not really happy with this because I expected the bigger one and without damaged that I can use every day.The plant material isn't even dandelion seeds.But not dandelion seeds.Mine did not me with the siline gold rim on it.You can see old paint underneath the new paint.Made in China.Can with molded.I kept it and used it as a pattern to make my own.But it's a good shaper.It's made well, with a strong velcro closure and thick lace.Visibly, it's perfect.expected for price.This is NOT cranberry.The glass was put onto the metal crooked so it's lopsided and no longer classy.ANY ITEM I HAVE EVER PURCHASED THAT HAD ANY DECORATION ON THE BACK....SHOWED THE BACK.I'm sure the shoe is amazing, it was too narrow for my son who wears leg braces.These are absolute CRAP.I just received the shoes that I ordered for my little one who is going to a flower girl and they are USEDIts way bigger than I expected, the shape isn't as trapezoid as I thought, and the buckles are bigger in the picture, there are too many gold accents.The jade leggings are NOT AS DESCRIBED.Not well proportioned.Not attractive at all, and its length makes it so that I cannot wear it under any of my clothes without looking like a slob.Nice material, just to big.It has broken FOUR times since I received it a week ago.I received these earrings and they are not worth buying the magnets stick together and I can't get them on my ears I am now stuck with earrings that I can't use...worthless...If you're looking for more of a t-shirt type material then this would be fine for that style.It's is NOT sweater material.Not spill proof.I've only had one pair of leggings, and they were crazy mfortable.Cute shoesThis at/fabric is not what I expected.these are very cumbersome, not mfortable and did not stay fastened with just regular walking through my home.It's not a sweater or cardigan.It looks like light silver plating on a mental chain.It is made in China.This dress is stunning in the pictures, but don't be fooled.... And the bamboo fell off the piercing base..The leather rd that is the main part of the bracelet is in good ndition an so is the latch.I did not receive the beltIt just doesn't work for mechanical reasons.And too much material.Does not feel like swim wear fabric and has no lining or bust support.And the packaging was good and the material is nice.The material used is medium weight, but has an attractive design.Thought that by spending at least . on this would mean a quality septum jewelry.The material is very see- through.Too short for my long lost earrings.I also disvered that the little belt holders on both sides were not lined up with each other with one sewn on higher than the other.great shirt for winterThe hair tie will not stay on AT ALL.which sts more but worth it.Chrome is really shiny and makes them pop.Potential for cute, I will redesign it to fit.I would have preferred to pay the full price for a high quality % leather belt.The bar is to thin mu hole started to get smaller I just put my org ones back in would be great if the bar uld get made thickerThe picture looks way better then the actual item.Any help will be greatly appreciated.Not a real Calvin Klein t shirt.I bought Calvin Klein t shirts at Nordstrom, great quality.It would be wonderful if they weren't see through.Half of the feathers had already fallen out and then a few ntinued to do the same as the evening went on.Completely different.I tried to return the jacket in exchange for one in a bigger size but I was told I needed to send pictures, which I'm personally not mfortable with.The weather here has been sunny so I don't understand.Not exactly what I was expecting.I did not expect perfection for  but I also thought I would get something wearable.It came directly from China and was definitely designed for very very slender women.this product came like something a year uld make.It has strings ming out of the material.Good thing about the top is that it's doubled so it has support.Buy a better quality from another seller.When I received it I loved it, Grandma" graving is really good but it is very difficult to get the picture in.It otherwise seems great.This suit has NO support on topAlso the silver one was missing a crystal so I never got to wear it.Not % sure it's authentic.Looks nicer in photoI bought these earring backs to ensure that I did not lose my diamond earrings.I should have stuck with the Eraser it was more reliable.It works much better as a robe than a dress.And the buckle doesn't lie flat once clasped this is the original reason I decided to return the belt If I had known it would have been a dot matrix looking print job put on a piece of vinyl tape I would have done it myself from my home printer.These Jordan's are fake, they are not authentic as described in the product area.These socks are woven too tightly and don't fit right.The sizing and quality was NOT as described.I wish I uld give this thing stars.The product ad says faux leather the belt that arrived to me was real leather.Ultimately, I felt like if you put my hair in curlers, overapplied my blush, and placed a big huge bow on it I would be ready for a tea party.I am giving it star because the pin that goes with it is actually awesome qualityDidn't like it at all the hooks aren't sturdy and for the price I paid I feel like it wasn't worth itThey were great for the first weeks.Dress came with no zipper and a hair inside the bag, not the look you are going for on your wedding day.Overall not a great purchase.It's a beautiful product but based on what happened my view have changed...Material is nice otherwise but if it doesn't fit, that doesn't matter.Doesn't hurt at all, but just doesn't look good.Not what i have expected the shoes is no good the heels starts breaking and haven't even worn it the heels are lean wouldn't remmend it to no one the one star is just for the looksWith a tank top under it, it will be perfect for her.I only wore this a handful of times and Very carefully followed the directions for its care in the few months I had this ring.It is beautiful.I should have read the description more on the fabric ntent.This scarf is lightweight because it's basically % rayon, not a fabric you want in the summer, or ever really.The only thing I liked was the lor, but the rest of it was so junk, that I donated it to Goodwill.But the lace was nice.The dress was mpletely see through.They all were almost exactly the same.They have declined my ability to get a replacement as well.The earring itself junk not worth a buck.The clasp was not a clasp at all just a circle and not good quality.If you'd like a boxy suit ver, this may be a solution, but there are far more attractive ones to choose fromI loved the ring and wanted to ntinue to wear itI'll add a picture when I get a chance, and will possibly dice up this belt once I get a new belt.Edit --: Picture added for clarity.See thru will not wear it.Very hot material.The fit is more Victorian than Edwardian.Well made but totally off in the size.And it has strings hanging off where they sowed it togetherI fell in love with this shirt when I saw it.It is very durable though, and was worth fixing because it was something that looked nice once it was on and fit.They are ol shirts but getting your right size may be a guessing game as I'm finding out with most t-shirt orders on amazon.I uld get a card of them at Walmart for cheaper and they are better quality.Otherwise, the shoe is separating from the sole which are still in really good ndition).You're better off spending the extra money for better quality and a better lookThese things didn't make my vision any clearer at all.these glasses were not sturdy.It's a pajama, it suppose to be mfortable.Also, I did not like the quality at all.I orderd a pair in October and they were a great quality and I loved them.Honestly, was red enamel too expensive?Bed quality.The mpany needs to be more clear.Not sparkly.The quality is great.Would give five stars if the price included two straps.The plates aren't deep enough for the stamp to transfer.They should start making these dress of higher quality not clingy material.If the bottom part would have stench then it would have been ok. JUST ok.Doesn't lay nicely as in photo.Make America Great Again hat made in ChinaNOT the same as the picture they're advertising It's beautiful but falling apart.The material is scratchy and taught on the thighs.These rompers were obviously made for potatoes.So if you are a potato, feel free to get it.You can't tell that the weaving is done with string.this is some kind of thin and non breathable trashy fabric( which will also make you sweat on a hot day which feels disgusting when it stick to your body quality is off design is off you think  is cheap think worth quality than dollar store it looks less than  up close forever has top starting . better than this ...All of the metal hardware on the bag clasps, buckles, clips, etc.)inmplete.NO CARE INSTRUCTIONS THIS PICTURE SHOW ITEMS I GET ONLY AND ONE OF THE BEATS OUT OF PLACE..since it was so inexpensive, it doesn't make any sense at all to ship it back.And the material is see throughIt arrived quickly and it is soft.I'm not being dramatic, it is meant to be worn blousy- this is bigger than putting on a pillow case.I ordered this to wear in Mexi so I think there it will work just fine but I won't wear it again after that.: not a round price of fabric it's a square plain scarf.She loved them out of the box.They look amazing out of the box.The entire appeal was that they were polarized and were reflective.they started out well enough but unfortunately they did not hold up well as after approximately uses the blue reflective ating which made them appeal in the first place for use while boating etc began to flake off.Soon it was impossible to see through the lens and i had to resort to rubbing off the ating mpletely just to have a pair of functional shades.This is not a safe binder.-a transguy who wanted an ice cheap binder and learned his lessonmust be % nylon, no spandex to keep them up or have any shape to them at allThese are just thick socks with a pocket for warmers.The necklace is mot sterling silver.Should be in children's clothing.Ok it was really inexpensive so I wasn't expecting for it to be perfect but this shirt/dress is super thin and the front and back are exactly the same so there is pretty much no definitive frontThey are the highest quality item on the chaps.What I got was a pain in the a** wolf bracelet with a dainty chain link.I expected the material would be similar snag-proof, lightweight, etc, but this is very wrinkle-prone, rough material.If you are a fan of the awesome tactical polos, this will be a supreme disappointment.Quality was fine.Great ncept though.The quality of this jacket was no where near what I'd hoped for.Feels like it is used.Isn't flexible as stated.I should have saved my money and bought a quality brand name at.Beautiful top, but sleeves are so tight I can't ware it.It looks and feels I'll put together.I would pay good money for the actual dress in the picture.But they showed variety.Not quality material.Such a shame because they are beautiful.Some suggested that it would stretch, but I seriously doubted they would have stretched enough for me.This is definitely not sterling silverThe string of the web.It looks great, but this watch was working just two weeks.I purchased this dress for my daughter.The bracelet is nice which is why I'm giving it star.This isn't even worth the flannel they bought for it.Made in china.The picture definitely disguise the quality.It is just mmon light weight tton shirt.The dress looks greatNor my cabinets.Nor my tiles.It is really tacky looking and not attractive at all.They do not cut wellYou should make it clearer that they are padded.Won't ever but clothes thru amazon again.Received the dress through prime and absolutely loved itThe Seller is great to work with so I give them stars...but the product does NOT fit like the beautiful picture.For the price it is nice material and well made.Would have loved to make it work" but there was no way...Didn't like the material so much.The material was fine and the outfit is cute but the sizes are wonky.Cute in the picture, but it's fabric is see through.I was so excited to use this product postpartum and had heard great things.I'm '" and have an hourglass figure, so I'm not sure if other body types experience these issues.This is NOT rose quartz..Can't figure out how to wear it.Jade has visible minerals and crystals in it and these are just brownish maroon glass.The bag is stylish and the price was amazing.It is a shame because the bag has many nice details such as metal feet, zipper and buckle accents, and nice looking material.This leads me to be believe that it is not metal.This product was not useful to me.The band was not tight enough until my third trimester.It was more expensive but I bought two and wore them every single day.Briefs ride-up very quickly and need nstant adjustment.See-through and too stretchyVery expensive for a little guys Undies.Didn't me with the marker and the quality is just laminated paper.Looks Good, although quit working after days... Not real warranty support or verage...Not too happy about this item.Atitlan obviously has NO quality ntrol on their merchandize.The lighting in my picture isn't good.The material was amazing, sparkly and vibrant unfortunately the dimensions were all wrong.The top spandex like material was tight enough to keep it in place so that was ok too.It does not look as nice add the photo.It's more like everyday underwear and offers very little ntrol.Material doesn't hang as well as the picture really makes the hips look big.It's a BEACH BAGWas super cute with dandelion wisps.Looks mpletely different.The design is not centered.If you want to buy cheep glasses that ol but don't buy these ones have had better for cheaper.Upon further inspection, I saw that the top was designed specifically for a woman with more on top.The look and quality are ok.ChemicalsThis product shows that one size fits all and I don't have much of a bust and it did not tie well.They were beautifully made but the sizing was a bit off.Cheap quality--- which I'm ok with bc it's for a Halloween stume, but there's no clasp to be able to put it onCompletely unflatteringNot made for American bodiesThe design is cuteThe fabric is light and so is the supportOrdered my husband the men's jacket, better quality leather and uses his all the time.Animal prints are NOT my style and I won't be wearing it.We have one dog and three foster dogs.The socks themselves are nice but I didn't want pairs of the same ones.I know have a mini jack hammer on my dressing table.Honestly I loved it at the start, barely a whisper but it has gotten progressively louder, so much so now its being moved out of the bedroom as it will wake up a light sleeper.It was great for days.The straps were unbelievably long.Other Body Candy earrings are much nicer.These look cute and fit well in yr old ears not sure why others had issues with them not fitting).It's see threw and made of a silky material.No good fitting.This was placed in the trash the moment we saw what it was.Is not water proof after minutes on the rain the water star filter in sideThe outside temperature was degrees both times.The material is where I find the problem.The shine to the material shows everything.I would rather have a velvet pair or a non shiny polyester, or even tton, but not this.And it's a kind of tshirt material, not a warm sweaterNow, I'll have to get the bag stitched to hold the exterior leather to the interior of the bag.The straps are a lot thicker than pictured.This is the tiniest pair of pajamas ever.Not mfortable at all and its very unmfortable holding my fiance hand wearing itThe product was not as expectedThe material feels more like an evening dress.Material was very cheap as well and I get that it's but... me on, uld've used slightly better material.Even though the design is amazing for breastfeeding I uldn't wear it because of the quality of the material.Not made well.I have purchased other romwe dresses and they are am amazing.I uldn't believe it- zero arch support.I have what's called a flexible flat foot so I bought it for the arch support.Not very good quality of materials.I'd say I got what I paid for, but it wasn't even worth that, this item is worth bout . in my opinion.It looks nice in the picture, but I don't like the material.Great customization and cute gift Update // We have repaired the chain times in one year.Not very good qualityI looked everywhere for beachy style pants that would be long enough to fit me.not a great product.Not happy at all with this product.There is no elasticity in this suit.The breast was too low for my liking.The matching baby cloths are too girly.Quality is definitely not thereNot satisfied at all with this product not good quality.Magnet not strong enough to hold money, not even bills.Pic seems to show it is A line and flowy.Smells so strong of chemicals.So I expected to have some benefit from these panties...You will NOT get any tan with these panties.It is pure waist of money.Good thing it wasn't expensive but still.It was nice at first,then one evening I felt a stabbing pain in my finger.Dress is not poof or Chiffon material.It is not bling it's clear beads.I wish they uld make it using better material.mpletely the wrong size it came for almost a child no chance of fitting me,although i wish it did material feel excellent just feel like its to far from phlladelphila to returnI thought it was sterling silver, but it stainless steel.It's cute but not as pretty in real time as in the picture.Bag looked great.These socks were very mfortable when new, but the wool is very thin and I wore a big hole in the sole after just a few uses.Did not wear well and much longer than expected.This quality of scarf i uld get anywhere under usd.The dress appears to be flowy in the picture but it is not at all.Was hoping to use this as a beach dress but for sure it will not work for that.Not real wool.It states machine washable but when I washed it in gentle cycle and a nld water, the white fabric turned pink.Didn't not feel it was leather as advertised.This dress has no liningTotally unmfortable.Liked but tarnished.So not mfortable.I own several of their umbrellas, but this one is not even worth .The product description was a polo shirt but received a T-Shirt.Not happy at all with the fabric either.white see thruCostume materialPicture looks a lot better than it is.Luckily they only st but I am still looking for a decent replacement.This band does not work.More expensive but it works.This fabric is so sheer it's like a sexy negligee, I can't wear this around the house I have kids and their friends in/out of the house.Material is sharp solid lors not a worn look to it.They are to long and they smellFabric was very quality, seems show through and it has no body.I was nervous because I have gotten lured in by nice photos before and been burned, but this had high reviews at more than %.First, it's a nice, soft sleep shirt.But it is a cute sweaterLoved it last year when we first bought it and it was a hit at parties, but, unfortunately, this year when we put it on again the lights stopped working after only a few wears since receipt).The teeth look great and very real but I uldn't get them to work.Not made that way and I understood that when I bought it but you have to melt little beads and apply them on the tooth and then apply that to your tooth.The product itself is nicely made and soft against skin.The bill has a white trim that makes the hat look even cheaper and is not shown on the image they provide).What little wind we did have felt like it was blowing right through the gloves.I noticed that extra glue had been applied in an effort to fix the faulty cufflink.This is my send watch winder my first was just a single winder).The orb in the center of the heart is a bead that doesn't even glow very well.This dress does not work like other nvertible dresses I have owned.Plus it is scratchy.Looks great in the picture, but wowwas silver and was expecting brass.My biggest issue was it hung low in the arm pit area, which would not have been a good look for family gatherings.I love the clor but the velcro is less than ok. My son had only had these shoes less than a month and the velcro speed working.If it wasn't for the product being in mplete and me needing to wear this jacket on a trip this ming week, I would have given it stars.Chain was good quality.The gold' on the pendant is changed and disappointing because it looked so nice in the beginning.The dress is beautiful.Not at all attractive.Cheap but definitely not worth it AT ALLSo I've ordered other products from Spiral and been pleased with the quality of the material and the vivid lors.For the price, I expected a lot more.Was not very good quality it was tarnished inside.Never had a bad item before isn't much, but definitely not worth spending on a pair of glasses that will break in less than a month.Yes, it stretched out on its own.It's just sitting in my closet.Cheap material but great if your going for the camel toe look not my style but if it's your then this is for youHave to pay a little more for something of higher quality.It's beautiful but the first time I wore it*t broke.They're warm enough, for stylish gloves, but not for anything else, like touching snow or ld things.I have one other of these purses and I love it.Not excited about this productI love the 's, but the crop shirts can stay in the past.Super see through material.Because of the material there is no give.Also in hot muggy states the dress is hot and does not breath.Although aesthetically pleasing it is not worth any money at all for a broken ring.Quality not great.Does not glow as advertised in the postI don't understand how the model in the photo can wear it so well.The white fur inside the hat is easily ming out and baby can pick the fur easily.Smells like dead fish.Invest in something with a little more quality.Outside material was passable at best.Otherwise good.Definitely not flowy like the picture.Fake leatherBut if you look carefully, you will find repeated patterns on the leather grain.The picture looks great.Doesn't look like the picture and I have an athletic build and there are uple areas that don't hide very wellThe dress is very cheap looking, The material is not is not of very good quality.It's not well made at all.The dress is very long, even with heels.also the description doesn't mention a thing about it being glittery.Once the dress was removed from the box, the perpetual shower of sequins began.The material is not the same as what is shown.The dress looks totally different than the picture.It's not sturdy nor good manufacturing.I thought it would be thicker for the actual pendant part but it's only a little thicker than paper.I LOVE shift dresses.This shirt is only good for wearing around the house.The dress is described as being made of a tton blend and chiffon" in the product description.They are worthless... all they want to do is llect defects so they can improve their own business.The material is quite thick.The mesh is extremely soft and mfortable otherwise.Looked beautiful on site, but when i received the necklace I was disappointed, The front stones were surrounded by clear stones; which were beautiful and the metal was shiny.If the necklace looked the same for the entire length, I would of kept, but he change of metals and lors of stones surrounding) were distracting and took away from what uld of been a beautiful necklace.It was inexpensive, and I got what I paid for.The velvet was soft and it looked great on my GF, so it is a shame.I would pay a few more bucks for a better quality fastener and chain.I was so mad I paid for better quality with a pair from dollar store.lor is not good..stitching not goodLooks like a tent, the v neck is above the llar bone so there is nothing cute about this shirtTo take care of the wrinkles in the purse I have shoved socks in there to capacity for two weeks now.I would much rather spend for a purse and have it look right, feel right, and look like it's worth than a purse that I spent and it looks like .very stretchy material, it light weight, but needs an interior tie to keep closed.NO LONGER SERVE YOU earrings and CALLUS A STONE BEFORE USING THE COLLARI wish it had been better quality, as literally everyone I had enuntered mplemented the dress.Looks totally different than the picture.I went with dc because I know them to be a high quality brand.The material is see through.Not leather as listed.I can't tolerate polyester it's too HOT.I pulled them out and they were very soft and looked to be perfect for my body.And no means is she thick, for that matter, neither am ISo happy with Amazon.Such a cute cut and the top material is great.The bottom material is nice also, but different.is not very good quality.I will give it a one star as I think my husband will be able to wear it and likes the Airedale breed as well.The flowers are about palm sized and looked off as well.It looks cute in the picture, but you uldn't pay me to wear itI bought this to use as a pattern.Otherwise beautifulBut it was in good ndition.Otherwise they are fineLooks better in photo, would not purchase again.The only thing true to the picture is the design.They looked good, got good reviews and were really affordable at only a pair.After about hours at the beach, we took the girls shoes off to put them down for a nap and disvered they had these very nasty blisters on the inside of each of their feet.Much much prettier In the online pictures than in person.Not sterling silverThe dress is shiny, and the design is not as pictured.This is a replica but there was no enamel which I thought there would be.I received this item but it is mpleted brokenThe positive is it keeps me very warm.Had to wear because it was last minute party.Not a real vera bradley itemI uld've done better with a home printer and transfers from StaplesThis is a very well built item to hold a few items.The other shoe works fine.The material is nice, and it appeared well made.For i didn't expect high quality but me on a piece of PLASTICThe sleeves are tight around the arm and it is definitely not as loose and mfortable as is shown in the photo.The quality of this scarf is not good.It does not look as bright and soft as it does in the picture.Pros Material is soft and lightweight.It was shinyGreat for sleeping in not to wear in public.It does not look good on myThis outfit is not for women with thick curvesThere are threads ming off all over.Do not like it and it smells pretty strongly of a perfume or incense.They were not soft as I imagined...Very heavy fabric.Very shoddily put together.The space where the loop hooks tot he purse is also ming out already.It is cheap enough that I wasn't expecting perfection but I was certainly expecting it to be able to handle regular use.However the is so loose the waist clasp won't stay done.It had American flag print on the lenses.Hot to wearWould be a perfect beach bag of large towels, etc.Don't like them have a much as the Isotoner a hottie with the chevron pattern and wish I uld find that glove with the smart touch feature.The material is thin and itchy, the fit does not feel professionally made at all, and the majority of it is open seam.This is not the sweater I received, I was baited and switched as well on this sweater (When I first received this item I was thrilled.It was a shiny silver, and gorgeous.I gave these to my daughters because they are allergic to everything but real gold or stainless steel.It was more yellow than ivory/eggshell for the bodice portion.I LOVED the Orthoheel slippers you used to make.They were rduroy, with a fleece inside.Please bring back your rduroys with the wonderful arch supportNot a dress to pick if you want something fancy.I was not about to put this near my precious baby's skin.Hair ties don't stay on it at all.Even though the low price is tempting, do not buy this.The proportions listed in the details and the actual product received to not fit the realistic body shape of a woman.This one piece arrives today and I am ' with a lbs.So they're very mfortable for an hour or so.clothing."Workmanship not good.I've had it for three days and it won't straighten out no matter what I doThe material was not what I expected.Smells like gasoline.Go for the higher priced Sunday afternoons hat, you won't regret itI loved the look of the necklace, but minutes into my stume party someone mmented on how cute my teacup necklace was.Although I liked the look of this necklace, very unique, it uldn't even last more than minutes into wearing it.The one item that did show up in the raggy box was nice quality tho.Besides the nstruction quality being poor and the material not being strong enough to withstand any stress on the fabric without tearing the lors ARE NOT COLORFASTNot durable quality... does not shape you as stated I am well endowed in the breast region DD) and the cups didn't ver anything.I gave it star because it is very cute and was easier to carry with the long strap.It is only one piece, the top onlyI thought it was individual stackable bracelets.Not the material that I was expecting.not good quality.This glue wasn't visable and upon using for one day the glue transfered to a . pair of Foster Grants sunglass.For the price, it's decent...its so beautifulThese leggings are great until you wear them and wash them.These have grippers to hold the floor and are fuzzy and warm.The vest is lovely, soft, and well made.Came dislored and looked nothing like the picture when it came to shine and sleekness.This adjustable" ring came and within minute it was about to be in two pieces.I have had rings I have gotten out of quarter machines more sturdy than this.If a ring says it is adjustable, it should be without breaking.The item I received is not an authentic girlie girls original tshirt.This product was not as expected.The product was listed as satin, but when I received it, it was more of a polyester with sequins.Not worth the extra sts.The ring it pretty but the quality(for the price) just isn't there.Purchased these slippers for my daughter.The inside of the pants is full of strings..It is a pretty bracelet Looks good feels good.But it is not a very strong product.The shorts are a very, very lightweight tton poplin no stretch and not the best quality.This isn't a towel.I was looking for a pencil skirt with clean lines.The padding insert is off-white, not black, which would make it look better.One can see the padding through the knitwear.I've worn adhesive bras before and love them.This one simply is not adhesive at all.I know it's extremely affordable but just invest a little bit more for a better product.Absolute.Jewelry store to buy the real blue Topaz ring,which came with a geologist appraisal.I'm okay with the quality but it's too hard to click in and it's hard to unclick.Quality has lessened over the years, but JMS is still a decent brand for a decent price via Amazon.These are NOT GENIE BRAS.They are made of thin material, have pads that are not removable, and are not supportive at all.The only good part thing in the box was the wig cap.Maybe the other wigs are better but I'm lucky my mom was able to do my hair to work in the style for the stume.Strings hanging out.I thought it would be stretchy.Oh and getting in up on my shoulders... certainly not going to happenVery strong chemical smell, which hopefully will wash out.Very disappointed my wife is having problems with the zipper not sliding well.Yet too long.Not happy with this ring at allgenerally just looked weird on my body type but if you have a bigger bust then this product will prob work for you better than it did for me.The diamond" part does not curve up around the stone.I wish I knew how to take a picture and put it on here.I did not receive anything close to what was in the picture.This dress is beautiful from the front however the back of the dress is absolutely not flattering at all.Nice packaging but otherwise really not appealing at all.I was hoping for inch and lighter canvas plus smaller ring.Great quality but just to big and bulky.Do not buy if you want good quality.LOVE the saying, I just wish this shirt wasn't made as doll clothing.Amazing style but with c quality lenses.These just can't be good for your eyes.I laid a X t-shirt on top of this that I bought last year from Woman Within, and this one is HUGE.There is no id number on the tag inside, it says it's made in China and the materials don't feel genuine.The quality of the dress was not very good.Much prettier in the picture.So disappointeded.. Zipper is not good quality.- stars if i uld.Not good the st day of using the strap broke and the purse just fell on the floor as I was walking to do my personal shopping.Also, the insole is NOT waterproof so the moment any moisture gets into the boot, the insole stays wet for atleast days.Surprisingly nice quality material and a good fit.Complete fake.Feels like those D glasses from the movie theatres.Think of the quality of a Halloween stume you get in a bag at a party store.The logo looks a lot sharper.They are very very mfortable, but it's not supportive for running or heavy activity.Jewelry was too bulky for my taste.Other than that, it is just perfect.This is not a simply southern brand shirt.There are also craftsmanship issues such as the outside buttons sewn on through the pockets and the waist belt being up at like chest level.Item not as pictured, and seemed not well made.I buy this brand of pants and loved how these were a thinner material, but I have only had them for about months and they have a huge snag in an area where it shouldn't.Not leather.Not happy with the fit, the workmanship or the material.You'd be much better off spending the extra money to buy a quality tie that will last you a long time.I bought them to protect my . ivory wedding heels from the dirt and mud during wedding photos, as we wanted some beautiful pictures taken in a nature-type setting.Now my almost ., delicate, beautiful wedding shoes are probably forever dirt-stained.Aweful.I'm not happy at all with this shirt.Is the dress rrectly % tton.The cloth is very flexible do not adjust to their body was unexpected items no good buy itThe fabric and the way it's made is not good at allI'm a seamstress and I know my fabrics.She loves Disney but doesn't know anything about fabric so hopefully she won't notice.No wonder we have body image issues.the material is see through.no good qualityWore it once, it looked not so great.Really soft fabric.Great design on pendant but needs a better chain.The material isn't at all what was suggested.MY HUSBAND WON'T USE ITThe material is silky and shiny and just not as appealing in person.Not to mention there's no warmth found in these jackets whatsoever.These are very scratchy and don't breathe.It was super heavy and hard to keep on my face to best display my eyes.Definitely made very wellThese things are not built to last.I'll admit that I think they look pretty nice, so if you need a quick fix they work, but for anything longer than about two weeks don't bother.Look good but won't last long.Not fixing properly.The design is ol but I wouldn't buy this product again.It is not a necklace, it is a chocker.The laces don't light up as pictured.They are not LED laces.No the lights on the clips don't send the light down the clear laces like we hoped when we opened the package.Keep looking and pay more for laces that may work and make your child happy.Certainly not a sweater.More of a tight knit polyester and doesn't look great.THEY ARE NOT CLIP ON EARRINGSThe glasses in general were great...I will not be buying from them again which is a shame because we have several sets from them.Gaudi-leathers Women's Set- Dirndl Pieces...Fellow boyfriends, be a real one and spend some money on quality.If the hardware matched I would've kept it.It is part silver part gold I don't get it??Not ideal.I decided to keep it anyway since I thought the thinner shirt would be nice for those super hot days.I don't expect heirloom quality jewelry but I was hoping for her to wear it for more than a day.No noise pad, sharp edge dogs into skin, in unwearable.It was hand washed both times.blue ink rubs off on your skin.Feels great and is made great, just not slouchy.Not great quality.They were bent to the point of not being able to wear them.Quality is nice though, the shirt itself looks great, too bad I can't wear it.This looks like something a drunken fairy would wear.Was not satisfied the bottoms are perfect but the top is so loose(and I have a large chest) absolutely no support or any kind of lining.I still expected it to be able to be worn by a grown woman but no.BEWARE very small and need underpinningsLooks great online.. Cheap quality in person.This dress would be great if it wasn't see through.Definitely a China product so it should have st I was NOT impressed with this item.Lights work but can't ntrol them.The quality was not as expectedThe design was cuteMaterial very inexpensive.Bottoms were perfect....I thought they'd be loose and mfortable.fell apart immediately.... did its job though, and does make the ring look much better.Nice fabric... but that's about itThe quality is not as described in the listing.It's made in china...She is very careful if her jewelry, so it wasn't as if she treated it roughly.It took nearly a month to get these bras.I sincerely doubt that these are genuine Genie bras.Plus, those beads on the ends of the strings on the waist might as well be made of aluminum foil.They would make good nose rings.Made in China The bow is not sewn well together.I didn't think it would be hard to make faux saffiano leather so i purchased it since it was Guess.For the price you can find a real leather bag.Where is the rest of the furniture?The look is not appealing.I loved the fit in my finger and the the fact that is silver but my send day on wearing it stones were missing (.As far as the actual shirt is ncerned, it is high quality and beautiful.Made for a doll.I put my hand inside, and there's a thick seem that goes along the sole, I'm sure that's unmfortable and definitely not waterproof not for winter).Cute design but VERY see through :Material so thin you need a wear a full camise If I wasn't so busy I would have returned all that I bought.Can't be worn hangs off of me.Not what i was expected, the picture looked way better than the actual product.The inside is packed full of a moldy substance .Too tight, not supportive, and not flattering nor mfortable in the least, so what's the point?The diamond stones take away from how nice this uld have been.I only kept them because I like the pearls.They are somewhat wearable for short periods, but too tight for all day wear.There is no way they will be able to get the same effect as in the pictures posted by the seller.In my opinion the one for a dollar less is far superior.This at is not a at is a jacket or a blouse not well made and is children size.mpletely see-through as wellThis is not the best bra for underwater use.The fabric stretches too much with the water weight and the padding doesn't help because it weighs down the bra.This shirt/dress is a tent.This is a knock-off of the DNC product and not worth the ripoff from their fundsThe material is very ld feeling not warm and zy like a hoodie should be.But it is NOT gold plated and not a CZ stone as advertisedLooks like a pper tone to me in person under any lighting and outdoors.It was made of Polyester material.I got my ears pierced today and chose these to put in.Material is not what I expected.Next, the material.Not good fabricI love, love love most of the jewelry .One star is too much for this sweater.very cheep materialThe top is tton.Bought this for my husband after reading all the mixed reviews I thought I would give it a chance mainly due to a reviewer the same size as my hubs having so much room in his robe at ').Not mfortable in clothing at all, I uld have vered a piece of plastic or cardboard cheaper and better.Don't like the material, it is too sheer and not flatteringThe quality is not what I'm accustomed to.I have some other nice tassels that came with designer purses and I was hoping to add a pop of lor to one of those purses with this tassel.Have seen better quality tassels in checkout lanes at big box stores.But the elastic really doesn't hold very well.The suede was not soft smooth suede accustomed too.How can you justify making someone's life a pain for having to get this and return it when this product was definitely not tried out by the maker, maybe it was on pointy shoes.Chinese product so off with measurementNothing like the picture, thought the material would be soft as the picture but it is very silky and feels like a smock material.Worn out after three laundries... Save your money and buy a decent quality items...Not good quality wouldn't remmendThis is a great item if you want to buy unfinished doll clothes.Its not as cute as on the internetThese shirt stays looked very durable upon receiving them.Not of good quality.The customer service was great and I was given back to get alterations done.Left a terrible rash after one day of wear that took almost two weeks to clear up.I tried on my bra after a shower, no deodorant, perfume etc.Doesn't light or make sounds.Not happy at all with the quality.Catches on everything.The design is beautiful, but that is the only good thing I can say.The lace doesn't look good.So not really impressed with the quality of the shoes.Smells so musty I'm not sure it can ever be worn.Its a total nock off its not the real deal and the fabric feels like a workout t shirt not ol don't get this t shirtIts warm but awkward to wear.No arch support the bottoms are totally flatWill not buy again and can't return it, since it's been washed and worn.The belt is now basically not usable.Love them otherwiseTheir was no baby bip.in Nike gift boxIts not the dress itself it doesn't look good on my body typeNice quality, but child sizejust use better qualityThere is NO at, nor trench-like, quality.The lining is not rrectly installed and attached to the outer shell.Looked too much like the stume jewelry that it is.Would have been a great purchase but both sides were broke off.Material isn't mfortable either.Cotton polo's was not wanted.Needed starchThe tool was really puffy and didn't lay nicely.I love the style of this bag.They style is great I just wish the zippers worked better.Kind of a neck choker.Not mfortable and baggy either.More form fitting.Wasn't expecting movie quality, but I feel it uld have been made a lot better than this.Looking through them was great but the frame just didn't workThe picture is not an accurate depiction of the product.High waisted and had a chemical smell.The belt material is just ok, not great.The fit was great and I was mfortable, but both of my big toes ripped through on the first wear of less than hours.I get regular pedicures and have never experienced this on a new pair of nylons.Every thingThis is not fleece.Gold lored pendant bezel and bright silver lored chain.I was really excited about this top to wear for spring and summer.If you are looking for a maternity shirt, this is perfect.The seam around the bust and the amount of extra material in the front makes it very maternity like.I bought only one to see the quality.After a few washes they have mpletely lust their shape and the fabric isn't wearing well.really shiny, not exactly work appropriateThis is a ZERO star item.Loved it and worked like no other belt I had owned.Today Sept st the latch broke and the belt is now useless and the return window is closed So much for the cheaper version of a good idea,They make the ones that are bought online look like fish scales really shiny and pretty but when you get them to your house they do not have any shine to them.Simply not very well made.The fabric is awefulIf this top had tie strings like the black part of the top, it would probably be fine.If they would just fix the sleeves it would be fine.Fabric was fine but the cut was crooked, sewn crooked with white patches at the seams cuz the seam was sewn with no regard to fabric orientation or accuracy.Picture shows a ruffle style drape to the dress portion, no.On the positive side, these are very warm and soft leggings.After two weeks worth of use, the leather" on the edges of the belt began to rub off.It's better to spend a little more money and get a quality belt elsewhere.I was hanging out every side of the topNice material but wasn't long enough to hold my locksWith the price in mind, i knew that this necklace wasn't going to be of the highest quality.Not really silver.The fit on the mittens is nice and tight, doesn't fall off but there issue with the actually material it is shreading and doesn't seem to be safe for our child.If this is a quality ntrol issue please ntact me as I would like to try another set.Not winter fleece, more like a light tton lining.It is a tee shirt material .These are not made for children for multiple wearing days.This material was like a Halloween stume.Silky, see through kinda material.Spend the on Oakley replacements.The bag is beautiful and well organized.When the outside zipper broke, however, I ncluded that the bag just isn't very well made.The first time I bought them I had that were broken and I had a lot of duplicates.I bought the large, it must be children's clothingA child wares itThe charms are perfect but the rope is so stiff that it undoes itself and if you try to wear it you have to nstantly keep tugging at the rope to stay on the charms.The quality of fabric likely wouldn't last more than a few cleanings.Nice pattern but had absolutely no stretch so uldn't even zip up.Usually a huge fan of the brand but not this time.The photo of the mannequin is not accurate.Cheep clothing My son may as well have had on no underwear at all.The item I received was not the same as shown.I thought this piece was so cute when I saw it online that I just had to buy it.It is shiny cheap, and is NOT worth your time buying it.I have wigs and style them for Cosplay.My daughter has a very hard time finding dresses, and when she thought she had found one, she was ecstatic.Too form fitting.I ordered this ring because it seemed to be durable.The only problem is that should have been manufactured in a greater length so as to allow greater flexibility in the ability to use on glasses with longer length at thesame time being able to cut shorter for frames that requires short ones.They are not very well made and not what I was expecting from Amazon.This is simply a liner.....no padding to itThis charm it's not real the stones are all falling.Smells like gasoline and I can not use it.However, if you can tolerate putting them in, the stones do look nice.Nice quality.There is no support or structure what so ever.Looks exactly as pictured.Pants are not a very nice fabric and shrinks when washed.Doesn't keep your ears warm.Nicely made.This was not at all as nice as it looks on the picture.It's too light like a toy...Save your money and buy a better quality one.Medium quality.Not worth your money even for a one time use im so disappointed that my son barely put it on and took it off with a huge gash where he can no longer use, which is the point of the purchase.Straight rubberPlus there were a few string hanging off of it when it arrived.Smiffy's wigs are great products for the price, but this was not wearable.Material was not the best.This item deserve no dam starsThese are not snow boots are in no way water proof.Not sure if this is the case with all of the sunglasses or if this is an isolated manufacturing defect, but I am not willing to attempt replacement.The pendant itself IS beautiful, but now I'm going to have to spend more money and buy another chain.Pants are made with a silver satin fabric, this as well and will show your undergarments if you are not careful.Don't like the material.Too clingy and hot.It's not worth buying and it's very short not long at all how it looks on the lady wearing it in the photo... Takes long to ship as well.It easily gets off, the ribbons scratch my daughter's face and the material is not so goodI was not happy have not worn it yet....Garbage, do not waste your time, she'll out an additional - bucks for a quality Harrington.When i opened the package, i noticed the shirt was made very well, aside from one thing.No design whatsoever.Feel like I'm walking on gravel.They look nice but not worth the dismfort.I love this umbrella.Thank goodness it wasn't expensive.not an adequate replacement.after several uses it bemes pink and looks ugly .. not good qualityBathing suites as we know are made of stretchy material, thus thy need to be made with a ver stitch at leased.Set were too different fittings.Pricey for faded glory.The ones at target that light up are cheaper and better made.Super baggy in the crotch... No fixing it.The quality of this jacket was fair at best.Hospital work shoes.Today December , look at the photoOnly reason why I purchased was for the reason that I thought that I lost my very expensive septum ring that I've had for over years and I had to go to a wedding in two days.so thinking that this product might be even worth it, I thought I would give it a try.Much better quality in terms of thickness, fit, and feel.They are beautiful but would not stay upHe says they were soft and mfortable, but definitely not worth the money as they are not durable.Thick chain, well-nstructed, but not it does not wear like Italian sterling silver.If there is something I can do to improve the look and enduring shine of this chain, I would like to know.The pearls are loose and I'm sure they will fall off immediately.Even the pics of the other reviews had decent size bows but not thisShoes were awesome but only lasted a uple of weeks.I only got tongue, eye brow belly button rings.Outdoor sport shades should be a bit more durable if you ask me.I may not be that easy on gear, but I have other shades that are nearly a decade old.Did not stick I was very sad as the shape and lift of the bra are amazing however I was having to push them against my chest all night or the would have mpletely me off.Dress is not jersey material.It is cute item but did not work for me....Quality was nice.I received SILLY BANDS rather than this super cute necklace for my niece.Looked much better on the photo.I would not have given it even one star but it is the only way to post my experienceShirt is lovely, but arrived looking used.Looks great.Described as % tton, % polyester.The at was adorable though.IS NOT ADJUSTABLE and the rock is enormousIt's a children's visor at best.The stitching is sideways and uneven to the point it looks as if were done by a little kid standing on a box for sixteen hours a in Asia.Spend the extra dough and get quality visor to represent my beloved United States Army.not real blood.Not a creamy classic canvas, but more of an off bile lor.The canvas thickness was nice, expected.The inside lining was the least pleasant aspect.Not worth the hassle for the return because it was extremely affordable and I got what I paid for I suppose.not good quality hard to useThis dress is NOT velvet.no resemblance to velvet either.Not exactly as pictured.The fabric is not good quality and I worried it would last one day on the lake.what is with all the glitter?it does not say it has loose glitter all over it.It's overwhelmingSmells like gasolineThey must not believe in quality ntrol.Looks good and fits well, but it is advertised here on Amazon as % tton throughout".I ONLY bought this, as I was trying to find a bathing suit absent of polyester.Didn't like the materialI am not getting into quality at all.Even cheaper than it is inexpensive.This style wasn't what I expected.The hook on the back does not stay in place so the top will me off at anytime NOT GOOD)It has numerous pleats where it was gathered at the waist instead of lying flat against your stomach, so it poofs out and doesn't have the nice, flattering look of the picture.They are not made well, hard to open and not worth the price.It's cute enough but mpletely sheer.This dress is ok, not the best quality material but good enough for everyday use, just fits too bigI was nervous about the material of the box because it said rubber," but it's definitely better than leatherThe light works but it's definitely off.So, in the end, the rings fails to achieve the purpose why I bought itOn first arrival, the tie clip looked like a great purchase.Customer service was AWESOME thoughThe dragonfly is bulky.Very disappointed, it's so tight that my little girls have a better chance of fitting in to it,It is way too stretchy and overs absolutely no support.The graphic is awesome but don't expect to be able to wear the shirt.worn off Not good quality, it does not smell like leather.Its nothing like the picture where it has multiple diamonds I wanted to like this hat, but it just didn't work out.These were shoe lacesI was happy to have them in the trash instead of on my skinI received only one fairly-sized lodestone and two tiny little nothings.materiel quality is not goodI thought I was getting a fluffy little delicate dandelion seed.I received a wad of who-knows-what rolled in an over-glued tiny Christmas tree-like ornament.The lace is like a thick lace, not as light looking as it looks from the picture.I didn't get holes in the other stocking until about day of wearing them.I wasn't expecting outstanding quality from this dress.This was especially true for the white top portion.The other gray) lored shirt I bought was fine and never had those lingering water stains.It looks like a sleeping wear.Should be stated as, infant earrings.Save your money and buy quality sunglasses that will last you.These are NOT authentic Vero Monte.These socks from China have no Vero Monte labels at all.These were advertized as leather.I puchased this to wear to work.This skirt you can see right through.It was a piece of crisp.When it came out of the dryer, it would only fit my -yr-old niece and it's way too sexy for her.The quality of the swimsuit was poor and it didn't fit properly but customer service was great.It would be better if the liner wasn't even included, I uld wear it as a swim suit ver up.Not of the quality as seen in the Picture.the zipper moves with difficulty and zips on the right as women's clothes do.It looked great in the picture, and I thought the low price was just too good to be true.Otherwise it would be a great dress.Its awefulThis was prettier in the picture.One of the CENTER of the flowers was already mpletely free and a serious choking hazard, I immediately returned itI would have expected the top of the boot to last longer than a month before showing any wear.Wear and tear was noticeable after about a month of daily use.I know they are not the super expensive like most wboy boots but I expected them to last more than a uple of months.And wake up people those curved barbells are not propee belly button jewellery.There is no defined front or back on theseDandelion was not in tact, just pieces.The picture make the necklace look very nice.the chain was not like in the photoNo adjustments have worked.Fits fine but smells like cigarettes.The mpany wouldn't let me return it because the shipping was too expensive letting me keep it offering me .The buckle don't have a name as it was seen in this picture.The picture makes you believe you will receive a cute, classy dress... NOT TRUE AT ALL.I WISH it was a strong plastic" smell.It came in pieces no happyrth it really expensive for that king of quality it worth - only no more.th there are no gift they are layersIt's better to pay a little more and get better qualityThis one is way more expensive . more) and has NO linerThe quality is surprising and I was not impressed.The shirt looks nice, but it is not long at all like shown in the picture.Bought these for my daughter for skiing, they were NOT waterproof and the seams split at the fingers and her hands were wet and frozen for the rest of the ski trip.I was not pleased with the quality of the product.It doesn't fall nicely like the picture.Not made very well,and the read is orangish in spots.Acrding to other reviewers this is a mmon glitch.Worn it only onceOpened the package and found the necklace in pieces.Overall, the quality was not good.Not good- rusted and dislored- and took long time to recieve- will returnIf I had known that I would have just bought the people sock brand that is % but is a much thicker sock and better quality.This shirt was made for a six year old, and the stitching around the alien was not good as well.The lights are not very bright.Looks nice on the site but not what I expected when it arrived.The dress overall just is not cut right.Well that nearly st the same price as the purchase of the dress in the first place.be very careful with sizing, other than that, looked way cute and good fabric.Totally different than pictured.Not very nvenient to wear.I've noticed the quality drop over time, since I've ordered several pair.Thought it would be softer and more like sweater material.It would be good for a child to wear when playing dress up.I washed it, thinking that would help.It might be good metal but i don't think it can be remmended for hard work or any use at all.Having said that, a shower curtain liner might actually have a more acceptable texture.Time set, send hand runs, but watch doesn't keep time.Quality of lace deration is different from the lace on the photo.Lace details do not much picture at all.I liked the belt, but it reeks.I placed it outside, and it still smells.And both of the dresses had many many strings hangingIt's not sterling silver.While the material is great, it's very tight.It has the quality of a department store freebie.I returned this item because it wasn't aesthetically pleasing and didn't appear like it would last.These are not safe to use as tongue rings.Should you be well endowed or have any cleavage whatsoever, this will barely provide you with verage, and most definitely will not fit.Not the quality I expected from this brand.What a mplete ripoffThis is the send time I've been lied to about the size of scarf rings I've purchased on Amazon, there will not be a thirdI received it in good time and when I took it out of the package the smell was so strong I had to put it back in the package until I uld wash it.After two washes it almost smells normal.It is cute and I will hang it up for next spring to see if it changes at all.The pencils do not work well at all.The tips break as soon as you sharpen them.I get better jewelry from the dentist's treasure boxIt was a crop top made out of a net material.This isn't the traditional crocheted top that stretches as you tie it on.Was not good quality.Not the thickness that I've had from previous RBX Sox in various lors.It's mfortable.There is no way it is for someone who usually wears a .Not even to go for a stroll down the beach or lay on a chair so what's the point?Stitching ming out after day of use.The leather it like sandpaper against your wrist.As always, I learned my lesson not to buy cheap items, z it is a waste of I'd rather pay more to have a better quality.These are aweful.When I excercise I have to be mfortable.Wish there was some type of warranty with this necklace, I really loved itFrom the picture, you would expect this to be a sweetheart" neckline under the lace overlay).This product is nice....until washedThey have a super thin layer of P/U leather at best.Almost totally see through.The quality of the material was not as I expected it to be.Not a mfortable underwear.Im going to see if i can have fabric added to the dress.Could have received a better product out of a gumball machine.Not a durable utility scissor at all.It only good for deration but not for usage.The dress doesn't drape when worn.My mom thought it was a night gown or an under layer for a dress.I threw the kit away, aside from the two small bristle brushes which may me in handy to clean a shoe or other household item, and will reorder another higher quality product.Do it right, buy something of higher quality, like all things in life, you get what you pay for.It is soft, though.fine for a cloth hat with no shape.This is not well made.It had a slightly oily smell but I think it would have been alright after washing.It might have been cute on a child, a non-picky child that did not mind scratchy materials.The flowers are the dresses are glued.Not mfortable These were bought for my wife who has very sensitive skin.The fabric is not good and size was too smallThen two days later after that the zipper mpletely ripped off the middle pocket..upset I had this experience because intitally this was such a great bagIt is very strong.The case was not very sturdy either.Open seams,different materials between sets and lors do not match.I didn't get this set I got the kitchen set I wanted the bedroom setLeggings were not durable at all, lasted only a - weeks.These glasses are adorable.The rings are gorgeous out of the package.I guess that's what you'd expect to happen with cheap rings, but they're clearly not anything close to authentic.The product description is not at all accurate.The quality is also not good.The dress is cute.I have bought my husband other Ames Bros shirts, and this one is not original.They should charge more and sew a better quality productMaterial isn't stretchyI am not out much since it was very cheap, so it might be worth the gamble for you since the picture looks nice.This isn't a denim shirt but Nice Fabric Quality.The ply is not heavy enough for it to be denimI was delivered a piece of fabric and the string that went with the lingerie.Doesn't fit my baby's earrings.It looks like you used super glue to hold the hand made flower onto the screw part and the super glue didn't hold up, note I only wore them for a day when this happened... Not very happy Not knee highs.Expected much better quality for dollars.It's a nice looking bracelet.Due to material it's irreparable and can no longer wear.material same.I don't believe the measurements described in the advertisement are accurate and the material is cheap and seems ready to tear.Not a good product not very good material and not really like the picture.Not warm, very thin.Pass and spend your money on a higher quality product.These aren't great, but the quality matches the price.I love it so muchIt is very soft.sleeve lace material is not sewn on totally..The leather was soft and it looks fine, but it is a disappointment.The photo makes it look MUCH better than it actually looks in person.The material was super scratchy.Not sterling silver.Granted the price was awesome, but not at all as elegant as the picture looks.Supposedly would keep a single bill secure, reality there's a gap that needs at least bills to secure them...The white top was the only one of the three that was double layered.Annnd the red the material for this had a shine to it and it was very stretchy.As much as I loved the look of it in the images, it just didn't work out for me.Glasses claim that they are very dark and almost impossible to see unless it's super bright bright and sunny.For that price I guess I shouldn't have expected the quality to be higherThe material is not what I expected, not in a good way.Not good for sensitive earsthe moxeay romper is perfect there, but this one digs in so bad it is unwearable.Material is good nsidering how inexpensive the dress is but the sizing, even for imports is way off.So much sparkle and shine, it looks very real.The stones are the perfect size.They have a lot of fire and catch your eye in the sunshine or indoors.The band is also very nice and well made.The only thing I uld think that I would do differently if I uld design a ring myself would be to add a little something on the side under the main setting, like a little bezel set sapphire.But I am very happy with this ringA few weeks later another stone was loose.Overall it was not flattering at all.they were metal.I'm not picky with moto jackets at all I love them.If you ask me this jackets worth like bucks.i have purchased dollar moto jackets that have been excellent quality.I purchased a sleeveless one from another maker and that dress is so much better than this one.the material is pair thin not a true denim and it just doesn't fit or loo good.Not sure what the material fabric is but it is definitely not tton.Lace is great.I didn't have it overloaded, just a few essentials inside phone, light wallet, lip gloss, really not too much.Oh if you like super tight pants yeah these are for you, I don't see how your junk uld breath wearing these.Overall the quality of it was very good, it didn't make my skin turn green which is a plus since my skin is very sensitive.Was not made at all how the picture looks.I thought these would serve the same purpose as other lobe supporters that I've used however these were not effective..This is by far the worst dress I have ever ordered Worst item I have ever ordered The bottom of the dress fit perfectly I understand the price is very modest, but don't try to sell something you are NOT going to deliverCool shirt.I felt like you uld see thru them, and they show every imperfection clearly.It wasn't silver lored but gold, was ONE layer of a necklace and arrived broken.It was made in China.These are not shirt llar brass but the giant jacket llar pins.Not an accurate description.This dress should have been beautiful.This will be an ashame to ware it.Buckle great belt sucks holes stretch way to much better if it was real leathercrappy version of the picture is what you get not well made at allNot a good qualityIt was not made well at all.These do not work on a touch screen at all.Anybody that says these work great on a touch screen are either lying or work for the mpany themselves and they are padding their reviews.Received the purse loved it.Cute, good price, but they turn my fingers green and look ppery after only a uple of wears.Ugh, it would probably fit better if it was a tton/rayon blend, but the poly sticks to your bodyQuality is not good not worth it.The one-star review is really for the quality.I purchased a lovely pink pom at TJ Maxx for that looks WAY better and has held up for much longer.She loves them, however only after week of wear the LED lights no longer work.I have other rings that are sterling silver and they do not turn like this one has.Side note- I don't mpletely fault them for the leg guards being so long, I'm sure there are ' women out there(no, but seriously- So LongFleece?Would be a cute inexpensive accessory if not in pieces.I was looking for a dressy, send look for a big night out with my husbandReally mfortable but doesn't flatten at all and now I've paid for a sports braThought this was a faux suede dress.I pay more for a better quality toy.Absolutely Beautiful.Worked great with my baby fine hair.This material is a mplete joke.Was not waterproof at all.not durable would not purchase againIf I had the money is get me another pair.Do not fit but luckily I am a designer and can alter it to make whatever I want.Definitely not made for women with any kind of chest.It was cheep material and not what I expected it to beNo real leather, fake leather is low quality, laced with ribbon, fragile.If this rset had been about  cheaper with free shipping it would be worth the money, but I uld honestly buy a better one for cheaper at a Halloween shop in IA.Aweful material.The cups are see through and offer no support.Picture looked betterQuality of the shirt was not great...Photos look much better than real thingI bought two different lors and the material was absolutely different and not mfortable at all.not happy with productThey are replicas.no qualitySpend a little more to get a better quality shirt.This is just from casual use.The straw hat I had before this one lasted several summers with many trips camping and to the beach.I had to buy a sow kit to put it back together.The leather was so thin and not leather-looking, nor did it have the feel of leather, that I wonder if it was really leather.The print is beautiful, but the feel of the shirt is not nice on the skin.Nice material.Absolutely no support.It is BeautifulCompletely see-throughFor I expected way better quality.Nice piece but falls off the chain after day.I bought these earrings because they looked good and they were stainless steel.The dress is made well enough, the fabric is very soft and flowy but the size...ugh.I'll be spending more money on better quality jewelry and a piercing jewelry gauging tool next go round.I've seen better craftsmanship out of send grade children.There was only layers of tulle, making the skirt mpletely see-through.Necklace poorly designed, all the crystals was off i received the package Not happy at all.NOT A SIMPLY SOUTHERN shirt.I'm American made.silver came off within a week it's brass looking now.It doesn't help with swelling or tension on flights.Not the mfy look sweater I was going for.and too expensiveThere's a ghost outline if the design that is actually sort of a ol subtle image, but not what i purchased.The quality of this one is not one they should be mfortable selling.This one was shipped to me literally as a tton shirt with a chincy silk screen.Hand made.The only way that the graphics would look clean and clear would be from about yards outIt hugs your body but the fabric was not mfortable to wear keychain broke right after I got it and I lost my work keys... not goodThis was delivered a week ago and my son has only worn them x.Picture isn't accurate to what you're gettingNot off-the-shoulder white sweater.Aweful quality.This is mposit leather not top grain.This didn't look good on me.These were pretty small diamonds, nothing impressive.I purchased the black pair and the gray pair because I felt they would fit perfectly.Beautiful piece, but not well made.Not a smooth aluminum wallet as the Shark or other brands.Not sure where the top rated thing mes from but I was not impressed with the price or quality.But the material?It's a see through chiffon fabric.The smell when i opened the package was overwhelming.was not happy with this item.quality was not as pictured.more of an item to wear for lounging.The zipper does not work properly.Don't buy this product, is cheap made and does not have any bra support.' and up do not but this the texture great but it just the sizeHad to return It was way too large but the material is very mfortable too bad it just didn't fitWhen I first got this at it was a dream warm stylish everything I expected.Can't be worn.Not an off shoulder sweater.Material is like wearing a tight parachute.The screwdriver was loose in the box upon receipt and scratched the rose gold paint already as wellThe top is not a crop, it is a bra..not enough protection for eyeglasses.These were too thick to work on most of my broaches.The chains are a lot thicker in real life than in the picture...The straps on the top stretches out while swimming.I want to love this ring, but I have only worn it for days, and I have lost stones.I bought this ring to travel with rather than my diamond wedding set.A little quality ntrol would be nice.The previous purchases were less expensive and the quality was fair.It is beautiful but what can I do if its broken.Not real handmade leather as advertisedI ended up cutting the head off and re-sewing the zipper, which worked out very well.Didn't smell good either.The first necklace I ordered as a gift was beautiful.Feels more like it should be worn for bedtime.I fixed them, but I will not be buying this brand again.It's a shop towel now.I haven't used it yet, so I'm curious how it will be when wet.The gold paint loring is off.Skimpy.Would gladly pay a few bucks more for better quality.Looks good in the picture but looks very chip once you put it on.It stains terribly which is expected for a cheap price but there are better fake bloods out there.Too big for my likingWhat a disappointment because the fabric and print are nice.You can dress it up or down and you'll always look great.Thick fabric that lays well and doesn't wrinkle.The dolphin design was paper.I just received this shirt after waiting too long to get it.I wish that this bag was more like the photo.They are nice looking and supposed to be great for foot problems.The material they are made from is hard and cut right into my feet.The fabric and the details of the dress is not the same as in the picture.For the days that the bag stayed together I got many mpliments on it.In the bathroom light this sparkles and is very pretty.These earrings looks exactly as I expected and I really liked them at first.Not the same material.This is a good belt... until it breaks apart... not worth the money since it cracks at the holes.I ordered other pairs/styles from this same mpany and they worked great for my husband and daughter at the water park.No fuzzy' issues.Unflattering on curvy bodies with juicy thighs.The shoe itself is just like the picture but it smells as if it was used not pleasant.Worn once and the gold finish has already turned.It looks better online than in person.The package came on time but the quality was not good.I can see the threads just decided they were done being held together.The bracelet was absolutely beautiful when I bought it.Go for playgirl rsets much better quality.I now own a crop top.The appearance of the wallet was fine.I loved how the sweater was portrayed in the ad.I don't care if it was fairly inexpensive.They are over-priced for the quality.These glasses were described as having a glass lens, metal frames, and high quality.Please put some effort into the materials and nstructionSpend the extra money and get a good quality stume.Beyond that, they were cute and very solid and heavy earrings, but I won't touch them ever again.They look ol but not good quality I guess.No a flattering dress for petite person.The fit is wonderful .. love the stretch in the fabric ..It looks like a pijama.I'm not sure what the problem is, but I've never had a problem with stainless steel.That being said, I have the rose gold and it is much prettier in person than in the photo on Amazon.It is sturdy.If I hadn't had the allergic reaction to it, I would definitely keep it and wear it as it is a st effective alternative.I assembled it and added the oil to the stone, placed it inside the holder and clasp it best that I uld.The clasp will not stay closed for the stone to safely stay.Where was this kept that you need to artificially scent" it?On a positive note, it's a pretty pattern.Material was not soft and itched the skin it touched.The fabric is nice, the embroidery seems well done, and it mes with an attached slip so it's not see through.A quality zipper would not have st the mpany that much and then I would not have had to deal with this on my daughter's wedding day.This bracelet is so pretty.If you enjoy wearing a bikini that makes your bust area look caved-in and squished, than this if for youCannot put in dryer because it uld melt, need to be very careful ironing for the same reason.The magnetic closure isn't very strong.It is too expensive for a swim suit .How VERY generous of themBeautiful but has mildew stains all over.A lovely, handsome looking watch, but the crown/stem does not work.It's good but they had beads not .It's a gorgeous bag No more clothing on Amazon for methe material is cheaper than anything you would buy at a dollar store.Definitely not surgical steel.And just awefull fabric.not even close to the durability of the original kipling I own.This sweater looked and felt very nice, buI thought it would be more solidShipped me the wrong item with nothing whatsoever to do with protection from the ld/snow.It is a very attractive dress and the material was nice, but it was a shirt.THIS IS NOT A LEATHER BAG.I do not know the origin of this piece of art.They're not as long as they appear in the photo and the quality isn't good.It is a hat made for an adult.Product is not made of leather.Allegra K usually makes great clothing and items.The lenses are clear glass.Material is good quality.Extensive st of return shipping.I didn't expect these to be the most sturdy things ever nsidering the price.Material is stretchy.One of the clasped was not put on the bracelet at all.Very stylist, such pity.Other than that they seem to be built well.Even though the jewel is beautiful the ring turned my finger green first day.So it'd be great for here and there wear but not as an all day engagement ringThe quality of the fabric feels cheap, definitely not worth the price, even though they fit well.I was hoping to get a cute Santa headband for my daughter's Christmas party.I got sequined antlers and devil horns with Christmas pins glued to it.The purse is spacious but the bottom doesn't have any support to it.Absolutely no structure at all.It is NOT LACE, it is made with inexpensive tulle with a lace trim.It was not mfortable, it was itchy and if your planning on wearing it for longer than a min foreplay I would suggest soaking it in fabric softener.I also figured this would be really effortless to wear but instead it's bulky enough without stuff inside it) and my thighs do touch enough that I can feel it rubbing my other thigh when I walk.In any dress that doesn't have a flared skirt you can see it right through the fabric very obviously.Gloves look fantastic.I would have easily give stars for this sweater because it looks so cute and exactly what I was looking for to wear with my brown leggings and brown boots.The gem fellout within a week otherwise i loved itYou get what you pay for, but my shorts were sewed together when they sewed the buttons on.These are very pretty and very delicate.Material is SO rigid and has no give which I understand why, but I wish there was some elasticity in it.Definitely not what I expected for the priceI bought it to wear in hot weather, but the material is not breathable at all.I loved it but after many washes and my toddler getting his hands and teeth) on the velcro it stopped holding well so I decided to buy another.I'll keep it as a backup or something but will probably be stitching new velcro onto my other one since it actually fits and feels better.The quality otherwise was what you'd expect for the price.It's really bright and loud.I thought the gold would be soft.The shirts see through.these r much lighter and ride up Kinetic much better choicenot enough support for the girls.Very pretty necklace but only got to wear it once.The product is very well made.It itches my ears, nice design thoughGreat interior though with the card slots.The material is very nice and it is a pretty dress.Recently they rubbed off and then turned my ears green.Nice to wear for a uple of hours, not so nice if you want them as a regular wear.It is silky soft just not proportionate.There were loops of thread sticking out, as well.Print and fabric very nice.The product does look like the picture and the price was great.I wish I would've just spent more money to get something with a better quality.The material is stretchy.I'm sad because I love the shirt.Looks much better on the modelNo stitching.It uld have been a great gift.I wouldn't highly remmend it, because the case is fragile and won't last alot of drops.For the price and expected quality I would not purchase again.Over paid for swap meet quality socksQuality.If I had known that before I bought it, I wouldn't have so many stylish items are available that do not require special handling and/or extra care time and expense.Also very sheer and not a fabric I would have bought.The material felt ok. And the embroidery was nice.Looks like Chinese manufacturing.The little gold leaf's fall off.Ok, so first I will say I LOVE this bag, it's perfect, except that after carrying it for weeks the stitching is ming out.Material has a wool feel.No sheen or threadwork visible.not supportive enough to wear as strapless as intended but ok with the strapsI can make it work.The fabric is beautiful, although quite sheer.It does not have a straight up and down front line for the opening.Beautiful but very heavyMy son is and he can float in the shirt.I have a crochet-lace extender from Origami that I like a lot better.Wallet is massive and doesn't hold cards well.I will give you a point because this thing is lightweight, portable and folds well.It is possible PERHAPS that with heavier luggage it might work but we stacked pieces of carry-on luggages and the rest of the bags purse, backpacks, oler) on top and it didn't work.Great fabric it is thick and heavy.Easy to press or steamI wish I had gone to one of them, but this was so cheap I figured I uld use it for a sewing project if need be.This skirt arrived and looked like it was decently made, had no odor of plastic or anything, and was the right set of lors.This necklace has bubbles under the glass that are right on the cat's eyes.they are pretty but not as sturdy as I would like.One daughter found a dress locally that we purchased but the other daughter wanted to look online hoping for a greater selection.We purchased it thinking that the quality would be mparable but... it definitely is notAlthough the dress after alterations) was cute once she was wearing it hence stars rather than one neither of us would purchase it again.The quality is okay, nothing special.The tank stringer itself fits well and is decent quality.I expected a better and stronger belt.I LOVED this shirt when i put it on the first time...After I received this first one, I thoroughly checked it to verify if it was really genuine whide leather and determined that it is man made PU leather.Looked mfy but totally sheer.Was not mfortable wearing them.Not mfortable and the high top rubs the back of my heel.I don't like the material of this clothesThis may work better on shorter women.It works but isn't as pretty as the picture.My feet didn't feel any better than what I started with and for the price I paid, they should have done something.Wore it for a uple weeks and the gold flakes off.These were inexpensive earrings.Need to lose a little weight to wear these mfortably.Fabric is nice though.material is ok.It probably wouldn't be safe to wear again nsidering it might leave me with a wardrobe malfunction.The ears also low quality as well as the tail.It was debastating because it fit so well and I received many mpliments when wearing this one piece on vacation.The pictures look good and the price is right.Fit was fine and fabric was cheap, but for the price, as expected.NICE LOOKING, WELL MADE AND ROOMEY.Not happy Amazon Better quality than expected, but just far too small, even using the Asian measurements.Some didn't have eye holes cut out but arrived sealed and quickly as expected.Great looking shoes.Comfy but not warm.I bought these for the thick reinforced toe my son tends to bust through the toes on all of his shoes).I loved the look of them too, however, the velcro straps wore down after only weeks of usequality was eh"But the quality is great, no problem with the strap other than not the lor I ordered, and Amazon is taking it back, I've already ordered and received another tan) fossil band, and I love itCool looking item but her name is miss spelled.My wife bought this crap.I can manage without the chain but I prefer not to have to hold the purse in my hands.The material quality was OK, an opaque crepe; and the lace quality was pretty good, sturdy and not very scratchy.The dress you see is not what you receive.I added a star for the attention paid to customer satisfaction.Here are some pictures for you to see for yourselves.To me, these kind of details are the touches that define the quality of a garment and hence I'm giving it stars.I purchased thread and restitched it then it was fine.Not thermal and the print in the product description photos is not what I received.Flat top septums are no good, at least for me.I cannot wear them as long as I can wear a fully rounded clicker.. Worth the price but don't expect to be able to wear it nstantlyIt looks good but it is not a rainat....I repeat, NOT A RAIN COAT OR WATERPROOF IN ANY WAY.Perhaps this acunts for the difference in quality.the lace was very nice the shirt itself I would never wear outside, very sheer, material was not tton as I had expected.beads fall off easily but was great for the one outfit I needed it for for that day.It was soft but didn't look too warmIt was great at first but then after a uple weeks of wearing it after my daughter's C-Section the Velcro has me apart from the panty.It's a fabulous idea but they just need a way to keep the velcro from ming apartIt was great at first, I loved the dangle chain.Not thrilled about the top piece, I uld not get it to stay.Have washed these three times and lor still mes off on your hands.Not a Travel" umbrella.Here's the problem with all of these a friend bought me they have seams in the front anyone over the age of - would think these polyester things were great.The material feels like satin.It's shiny and it's not tapered at the waist.The good: Excellent clip wide and sturdy with no give it keeps tension when I've got a lot or a little cash.They are a nice jersey material, so if you are ok with cutting the bottom off they would still work.Diamonds feel outNo zipper, nice beadingdecent quality but very large fitThe shirt is beautiful, if you don't move.It looks like great material but I can't fit itOverall this bag is okay, decently well made and pretty lor.not that well made.It's a lovely looking set, however I lost the bracelet within an hour of putting it on.The loop was too big for the pearl that was to keep it in place.The necklace stays on just fine.I'll keep it as lounge wear around the home, but doubt I'll wear in public.More like white topaz.This thing arrived today and has threads ming out of it and has an aweful smell.The item itself is super cute and I love the ncept because my daughter has really big hair.The dents in the top of the hat don't line up straight with the curve of the brim.You'd be better off getting a leather RFID wallet.I uld tell it was fake without much inspection.Again, I know not to expect much given the price, but it was much nicer in the picturesThe product looks very pretty, but the quality needs to be improvedThe stones are nice though.Cool design, but not made to be worn.But it looks too obviously inexpensive.Very cute, but not very warm.Not enough insulation in top of hat.If not for this, they would be perfect.They look good for a few sends, with a lot of adjusting.This dress should be very beautiful, but it is not.I have cut and pinned and done what I can with it, but I would not buy it again.Have to find a gold key ring to see if I can adjust it.The lor was beautiful and the material was soft, but nstruction and fit weren't great.The lace" at the bottom is so stiff that it stands out like a hoop skirt rather than draping naturally NOT flattering at all).It's a cute top, just won't do the job for me.as i own nothing but pieces, i really wanted to get a super cute one piece for a trip to the Dominican republic.this lovely suit, material was good also but torso was too short on me.I purchased as a mother's ring prong stick out a little bit and snag close but overall very nice looking ring.....updated.They will definitely slip off if worn with shoes.It wasn't a nice feel.I love this design and hope my infant grows into it, but I searched for month old hats and this is not right for my son.The dress had a very strong smell of factory.I believe it to be a very beautiful dress but the torso fabric reminds me of a table cloth.I was expecting a better quality fabric too, but it fits good and feels mfortableThe sweater is pretty and well made.Fits well but I really prefer tton clothing and that is the primary reason I purchased the item.The hood would ver a child's head fine but a adult it looks like a yakima.The material is quite light weight, certainly not sturdy enough for a work shirt.This will be fine for bumming around in but it's not what I expected for quality.Probably wouldn't have bought it knowing this, but I'll still wear it.They are soft and stretchy, and I can sew so I will probably take I.The fabric is soft and it is a pretty lor.It is not a quality garment.The beads do not match the picture that is posted.The material is not soft nor does it stretch.Get if you want to have something that looks ol, but don't buy for practical use.Pretty,but not made well.not original and made n chinaIt is not as long as expected and the pearls are spaced too far apart.No structure at all.Made of jersey fabric.The details say this is a sweater.Quality seemed good.It was not stitched very well, and does not suit by butt whatsoever.Be warned this item is really not made of high-quality materials.The way this item ages is remarkable.I was expecting this item to last for - months with light use.The material is VERY low quality which is a shame because the style is fun and sexy.But the solid lor was fine with no holesThe material is textured like tights, so they are not as soft as normal leggings.I am returning these due to the scratchy texture.The plugs are very hard to twist together and aren't very mfortable.not a lot room for my butt.White elastic rectangles extended the llar too much for my liking.White fabric long ovals good for a single use then the button came un-stitched from them.Maybe some of them wold work better for you but i suggest just buying a quality pack of the type with the spring loop.I ordered this infant aviator hat and the bumble bee infant knit and they seemed great at first glance.The knit helmet runs a little big for an infant, although done very well as far as being soft and mplete, the design doesn't quite match up with what you see in the images.IMO It'll look great and protect from the sun if you're skinny.I've tried the other brands and they're bit of better quality.Now as a shirt, it works fine.Not the quality I expected.I'm keeping them in hopes that they'll get better with everyday wear.Would almost be the perfect knock off if it didn't ver my cameraThis would not keep you warm in winter.I wish I uld have straightened it, my daughter would have loved it.I have purchased the inexpensive nylon sundresses from China, and I like them.Cute outfit and a perfect mpromise between my yr old and I.Fabric is good, design as well but the size was small even if I asked for large sizeThey were cute just didn't stay up on the side of my earIt's really really beautiful, but it broke after week since I wear it.The picture looks way better than what you actually get.I have not worn it yet, will have to get it adjusted.The fabric is nice and soft and stretchy but the fact that the front mes up so high, it doesn't look right.It's beautiful.There is no inner lining, so they are not mfortable to wear either.Nice quality much larger than I expected...but i loved how clear it was.The nose ring was beautiful, but the clicker is not well made.I have ordered many of these tear drop Swarovski crystal necklaces in the last six months and have normally loved them.Not high quality, although it's mainly for his birthday, I'd like to think an expensive outfit would last more than hours.They seem to be made very good.They are warm enough for me in the spring so far.I like these better, they are more mfortable and stay on better.Not extremely happy but needed the bathing suit so we are making doThe first one is beautiful and came in brand new ndition.This item is not the same quality nor appears brand new.It's beautiful but was not even close to fitting me.It feels like a quilt so thick makes you want to go to bed and ver yourself with it..They're really cute and I love the way they look BUT they aren't durable.Does not look good.but it was really inexpensive so whateverNice looking,but looks cheap,not sure abt natural leather,not remendedProduct runs super small and wide, quality not as nice in reality, looks way better online than in reality.Bag is attractive but cumbersome.Not the same quality as original Woodies from .The mpany needs to supply a better chain.Very soft fabric however.Given the price of the product I expected better quality.Great great great bag, until it broke.The lambskin was gorgeous, but these are going backThe quality is not amazing but the style ncept is cute.It is not sterling silver.I like this clip looks wise but it does not stay in place.The grip does not hold things it isn't strong enough for what I wanted it for.Not very good qualityI used it for a few weeks, but now it lives in my closet.But then again, it was an inexpensive shirt.I was just hoping it was like a tton material.shiny, Polyester material.The thin material is niceThe weight of the fabric is nice for warmer nights.It's very lightweight tton.Not as well made as I thought.Too expensive for the quality of the shoes.It is definitely cute, but chances are it won't work for most people.Great material.Drapes nicely so may keep despite plastic ntent.For the price, one would expect full lining and an +% wool blend with some synthetic fiber for strength.looks great on picture.Overall, it seems to be better quality mpared to many items made in China.Again the lace that over hangs is bluntly cut with no design in mind.Was not as cute as in the pictures.Has the style I was looking for, but after months I'm already looking for a new wallet.I find that the material is real mfortable, but the one size fit all does not truly fit for all in my opinion.The leggings is not fitting.Comfortable, but not worth keeping.Hoping the new one will be better quality.It also is not as mfortable as I was hoping.Cute dress but definitely not made out of a thick material at all....Material is funky.The picture makes it look warm and zy.They aren't wide scarvessmells like fishThe material has no give to it.Very pretty earrings.These are made from a nice material but that's really the only redeeming quality.They don't lie flat on the breast and they bunch up between the petals, and if you don't lay them on perfectly the first time, you can't fix it at all because they won't stick.Very cheep fabric.This dress is not high quality.The tag claims a tton blend but the material is definitely NOT tton.Beautiful.It's not perfect, but it works as a phone case.I also had a belt loop me off in the first week.Is Not as good of quality and Alex and Ani bracelets.:( It was affordable but I'll have to think about whether I want to wear it out.I think I've worn this once....Very pretty picture, a little tight for my liking, not long it mes just below my hips, i HATE the material.Im a tton kind of girl, its like spandex.Looks more like a - month size give stars for softness an quick delivery was gonna use as a Halloween stume but no way can he use itThe material seems to be of high quality and they are warm and fuzzy on the inside.Quality isn't that great.Didn't like the lor or quality.Chip materialBetter used as a night gown.The quality was good and the delivery was on time.So they are very fragile.Darker than the one shown and very thin and sliky softn perfect to wear in hot or nice warm weather.It looks nothing like it did when I bought it a week ago.Very delicate.There is more of a texture than I expected which is nice for dressing up but not for daily mfort.Feels good and the quality seems ok but its fit is dubious.Fabric is static attractiveIt's hanging in my closet and I've yet to wear it.It looks exactly like the picture, so they get some credit for that.Very form fitting, not like other Allegra K tops that I purchased.The pattern is cute but the material does not look good...They probably work okay on a hard floor, but not carpet.Waist band thick roll no woman wants that.Material inside layer is tan outside layer denim tone.It was closer to a Halloween stume than a quality I would wear everyday.The scales are printed on, so you can feel them crackle when you walk.Quality is okayReally cute shirt, well made.The woman herself looks very clear, I think it's just a matter of the graphics needing to be refined a bit.I fell in love with the dress from the pictureNot what I expected quality wiseDon't think I'll be buying them again since it appears that the quality has changed.The quality was not great either.Very mfy, but the zipper mes unzipped very easily while working out and gives NO support.I'm happy with the looks for the price.Great support and easy returnThe quality of the fabric was low and it's a struggle to clasp.Quality seems fine, but fit much too baggy, so mine will be going to goodwillIt is not worth the money it st, it's not sturdy.Some of the touch enabled" areas of the fingers are not touch responsive.The gloves however feel warm and mfortable and look nice.While this outfit is very cute, it is not functional at all.The actual material is closer to a workout shirt.Quality was not as good as expected.Feels like it was made for a doll.wish it was made with a bit more qualityDoesn't matter if it's breathableWhile this is a very nice looking bag, the smell is horrendous still lingering many weeks after purchase and the quality leaves a lot to be desired.I loved the looks of this bag straight out of the package and moved" into it right away.It was so inexpensive that I just kept it.Wish it had been perfect so I uld have used it.Material is wooly.It's not warm enough for my son to wear in the winter.The fabric is SUPER SOFT, for starters and made quite nicely.It was made very well.It's nice fabric and print, just wish I uld actually wear it.I really expected to love these glasses.They'll be good for hanging out by my pool but outside of that, they are NOT ever going to be favorites of mine.The tton is a heavy fabric and I have a tiny waist so most all dresses fit me perfectly.The quality of the lace and beading is not the best.The rest of the dress is fine.It is dowble lined and sturdy.The material does not hold wellThe plunge is very deep Be prepared for lots of cleavageI just disvered the hole between the left first and send fingers.Nicest pair of gloves I have owned in decades.Excellent workmanship.These sweaters are amazing.They are great quality, soft, and don't fade after washing I love the ones I have ordered in other lors.This dress is not as chic as in the photo.The quality of the dress is what I expected it to be.Bought this belly ring, and it was stunning upon opening the packageThought these would be thicker and maybe appropriate without something vering your butt..The black fabric is okay...you can't see through it.Overall, ok for but I'd invest more on a sturdier and more mfortable bra.Beautiful shoe.My saughter wears an . and I bought the hoping she'd be able to wear them a while.I have a hard time getting her feet in but I need them for a wedding in days so I am hoping she can break them in and make them tolerable for that day.On a positive note: it came much faster than expected about a week) the peach lor is very pretty, and the style is darling.This bag is not like leather at all.Will keep it and use it as a top for the winter yup, it's warm if nothing else).I had no issue with the quality of the product but the sizing is WAY offI was expecting a silk satin as opposed to polyester.So as a built in bra it will not be mfortable.The elastic stretches makes it too loose on the foot with not much support.the jacket is very small and the fabric is not good quality, sorryThe waist line is very high as well, wish it was a bit lower to be more flattering.Only feature that's beyond a laptop bag is the stroller hooks.Realistically it won't hold all the basic stuff your going to need if your going to be taking your child out longer than an hour.It did not have enough layers or thick enough material.These are great in terms of warmth, but I'm '" and generally don't find many products that are so short.HAT WAS MARKED SM/MED ALSO WAS NOT PLEASED W/ THE QUALITY.The torso of this jumpsuit is very short, I'm '" and well proportioned, but the pelvic bones came to my navel and the patella was on my thighs.I was hoping to get the same support as my Vionic sandals.Decent Phone Case For The Price.Nice grippy soles, easy to slip on.Smells and feels like an inner tube on your body:(I've ordered less expensive tankinis with better fabric and quality.It doesn't match and it's driving me nutsNot flexible.Earringswith loring faded quickly...the stainless steel ones are fine.Should have just ordered a set of those instead of wasting money on a multi-lered selection that did not sustain lor well.Seems like good quality but didn't fit the thick screw-on posts of my k indian gold earrings.That is kind of what I expected for this price though.Cute necklace, surprised by the weight and the style was great.It's a beautiful dress though.Material is more silky and shiny than the image shows.I like the charms but not the leatherI was expecting some kind of woolish material kind of Autumn appropriate.It's cute but didn't look right on me.Have not worn it once.My husband is an electritian and the ring stretched out within a day.The material doesn't stretch very well.However it is great fabric and as shown online just way tooo longIt's a great design, but it needs a LOT of QA work.Didn't care for the fabric.Material is light, perfect for summer, but as one reviewer stated- this definitely need shape-wear.... which sort of defeats the purpose of dressing light mfortably.Quality not same as photo.The one in description photo is fluffy and feathery.Not a good quality does not sit snugThe fabric is soft and pleasant on the skin.The major feature of this top is the llar.Damn shame too bc once they're on they look great...ya know... Other than the huge holes.Nice shortsThey are nice socks but I got three of the same kind there were supposed to be two different pairs.They also have a black one that I would love to have, but I'm worried about the quality so I won't be buying it.Looks greatDoesn't mpare to the quality of clothes you can get on sale at Gymboree for a mparable price.The jacket itself is not a great quality to being with.Very good quality.It only has one row of derating.Honestly I wanted to love this, but.. i uldn't i got for an event and the shortest part of the dress is short.The material isn't very stretchy either and it is cheap-feeling---not breathable or soft.I've had much better apparel/fit results with other Chinese manufacturures, but not this one.Good price for the number of pieces, but I much prefer the traditional retainers with longer side pieces.Thought I would try both metal and plastic to see which I preferred.Wonderful material.Nicely built clothing item for juniors.I purchased it because it had gold hair and dress and the gold is gone now.It's a tton blend on top and chiffon on the bottom.The package and socks are not marked as to what the blend is.It's super short and looks better in the picture than in person.It seems to be too sheer fabric wise.I did not like the materialIt was a different material, though similar in lor.We have saved the pieces and may yet re-string it, but still only worth getting if you like it enough to nsider it a craft project.Beautiful fabric.Cool looking buckle no doubt but days into wearing it I have to fix it.Looks seductive with nothing underneath.We also plan to add things to make it look more realistic as we always do with splay.The product quality is very good, but BEWAREI usually wear a x I bought a x and it is tight, the material is soft and strechable so I am keeping it.Not warm enough for canadian winter.Very easy to break but it's really pretty.Works well if your pregnant not if your athletic built.When I got and tried them on it didn't feel right.Too dim for the Florida sun.Cute, but after washing and drying it was definitely more like a moThe dress is beautifulUpon first receiving it, I tested out all the zippers.There's a good reason quality purses are made of metal zippers so they lastIt's a shame because the overall design with the front pockets and roominess inside was just what I was looking for.It is obvious to me that the quality doesn't stand up to the price they are asking for this purse.Hemlines and stitchings out of wack but ol designNothing like the pic; material is not soft and flowy as it appears in the pic.Maybe it'd be cute with leggings???The rings are nice but both chains broke within a day.Not sure what kinds of chemicals are in the dyes or in the material.The material was too hot.I LOVE the graphic on this, and the % tton is good quality.The dress did not look well put together..The gloves look nice and feel soft.I would prefer them with a fleece liner, instead they have no liner, which lets ld air through the open knit.Other than that, the fabric was fine.I was hoping these necklaces wouldn't tangle.The cape and head piece were the best parts of this stume.The bracelet is beautiful however, very unhappy with the quality.Soft pajamas, but were on the small side.The fabric is not quality.The tie seemed to be of good quality, but the lor was not as described.The bag does look ol but if you can't wear it.....The metal isn't real strong.Aside from that, the print is lovely and they are very soft.Th top does not have any support at all.If you are not well endowed" then this bathing suit will work perfectly for you, but for us with more curves, this bathing suit will not work for you, unless you are trying to flaunt off everything.They do pill, but after numerous uses and are generally more hardy than other jeggings I own.I can't tell whether the quality has gone down since my last purchase or I just got unlucky, but I'm not very happy with that development.Good quality, however they were a bit small.My other pants received stars... however if they don't fit they can't be used, it doesn't matter how good the qualityI received a watch from Bling Jewelry that does not work.The material is nice,soft.But the gray pair is at least mfy, that's why I'm giving stars instead of one.It's ok. Not real gems/stonesWill probably replace them with ripstop tton carpenter's pants, if still available, which fit fine when bought several years ago.If you are using them on a non-abrasive surface they might be OK.The ones in my most recent purchase are much thinner than previous pairs, the rubber nubs are not as effective at keeping me from slipping.Utility type bag, Not Fashion quality or look.The graphics printed on it are great, but the highlight is supposed to be the little electronic doo-hickey that, when pressed, lights up two LEDs and provide very tinny segments of holidays tunes.If the ring didn't turn orange after a dozen wears, I would have given it stars because initially I got several mpliments on my silver" jewelry.They don't get worn as much as what she picked out.Beautiful dress.This product is not satin, its almost exclusively polyester.Otherwise, it looked fine, but I will be returning it.Looks great; I enjoyed it for about months then the magnet fell out of the metal nnector which has rendered the bracelet useless.Very beautiful thoughI just did some alterations.This was a great photo of Audrey Hepburn but the animation isn't as well as should be.Has an odor that is over powering.Order up, and do not expect qualitycheesy lookingMaterial feels wonderful, but I uldn't get it on.This top looks better on the model than it did on myself.Lovely style but too smsllIt was great the first time I wore it, now it won't click into place.If they were any more expensive, I would have given a .They looked beautiful while they lasted though lolThese were extremely beautiful when they came in.Give it a few more months and I'll be the proud owner of a soft plain black t-shirt.This robe is huge and heavy, not a waffle light weight spa robe.The snap is very feeble and difficult to open and close because it is not well made.they catch on llars and scarfs and easily me off.not really what I expected,material is not soft at all.....Where I live it rains at least days a year so I need a rainat that will be able to handle some wear and tear.The shirt pattern and cut has a feminine quality about it that I was not mfortable with.While the organizer is nice, I found that after using it in my Longchamp Le Pliage large tote for about months, it started to not hold its shape and cave in on itself.the jacket also just didn't look quality like it did in the picture.the sequins were fine i have no mplaints about them.Not a fan of the material.This at is gorgeous.Very firm and not mfortable.I was looking for more cushion.Top was not a deep V. Not as cute as in the picture.I do have sensitive ears, my daughter is able to wear them.And was mpletely see throughBuckle is good quality but the belt it self isn't.When I wear it, it looks great but anything longer than an hour or sitting down, it will roll.Was dissapointed on the quality of the chain.Wore for a few hours on one day and it tarnished/turned bronze.Not as nice as the other pieces I purchased.Not to my taste really.nice stone necklace, needs better images.It does not firShaft and ball pouch is in a odd place higher than it should be makes them fit weird still fun and sexy wife can't keep her hands off when I wear themI have a love-hate relationship with this skirt.Unless you're willing to keep up with the repairs, I'd remmend springing for one of the more expensive options that might be better made, or making your own.It has a wedding gown look and feel.The fabric is cheap so the price makes sense.I thought it would have a metal feeling.Love the material.The item was perfectSome what of an innvenience walking, in the ld.The silk is nice, though it helped ol me off in the night when it was hot.The vintage turquoise one I ordered is a nice, soft % poly % tton % rayon jersey fabric.The white is % tton % spandex.The black and gray are % tton %spandex, So those three are being returned.I normally wear a L w mfy room so I bought an XL just to be safe.Super thick material.Also the sequins and stones are not fastened on well.I'd have been happy with it if the picture were more representative of the product.I love it, I removed one star because it did fall off about twice, I had to put it back together.I have diastasis recti and this helps me feel more stable and put together when I'm working out.It gets bunched easily when I try to Velcro it myself but it is fine if my husband helps.While the cut is nice, the white is % see throughQuality is great.Picture was much nicerOne of the earrings was not hooked up properly to the inside of the other loop.Looks a lot different at hand than online.doesn't look right with a regular tie.Otherwise, really pretty.Love these, but I washed in ld water and found a run.The quality isn't great.First and foremost, the fabric is really soft, stretchy, and flowy.That may look okay with a cardigan over it.Dope design.I have a handful of Carhartt pants in several different styles.The design is as pictured, but not sharp, images are fuzzy.But the fabric is not tton or good sleepwear material, which was what I wanted.Not the most attractive skirt in the world.It's lightweight and really cute.Quality ntrol anyone?I bought a pair of these robes in Large, hoping they would be perfect for my husband and I to walk to our hot tub.Not great quality and the lor was closer to olive than mint.The build in bra is pointy, the bottom of the dress is tulle.It is really cute and soft.. that is the plus to it...This is an inexpensive skate stume/dress.For the price, it is okay for a dressy appearance while working out in a skating rink, but you still need to CYA if you are doing jumps or arabesques.To the point that I had to give them to my gf, because I uldn't in good nscience wear them.It smells strongly of chemicals, as well.I bought a different one a day after this arrived.Fabric not very stretchy.I had to buy a slip with lace at the bottom and I'm hoping I can layer it and still wear it, if not I'm not sure what to do.It's a cute dress, and I'll wear it after pregnancy, but that's not why I bought it.If they uld tailor it better to the growing belly of a pregnant woman, it'd be a wonderful dress.They did not glide easily and I found they stuck a lotI didn't care for the material but a  worker purchased them from meVery pretty and well made but the bars are a little shorter tHan my standard ones making them too short to mfortably wear.If it wasn't so mfortable it wouldn't be getting any stars.I will super glue itAlso, snaps on one side is not enough to to prevent smearing poop down baby's leg when changing.However the description indicates it is a poly/visse blend fabric poly/ visse) but what I received was % tton.I would not have bought it if I knew it was % tton.It is a good looking garter and is made with quality materials felt great with the exception of the velcro).Positives: Took paint well.Adjustable rubber rd held horns on well and disappeared into hair with no problems.Definitely NOT worth the price tag.The item is cute and was inexpensive, so don't expect the best quality in craftsmanship, you get what you pay for.We are happy enough to keep the shirt, but not happy enough with the quality to buy it again.GREAT QUALITY.It's very mfortable to wear.Unfortunately tarnished quicklyCute look but the twist on part is cheap so it doesn't screw on all that greatWow...the material is NOT the pretty and shiny material that you see picturedThis is soooo loose.I wanted to love this product but the right shoe won't turn off at all until the battery dies.The material doesn't give at all.Product is bulkier than i expected and definitely not the lor it shows in the picture.I still have it.. but the material is always thinner than you expect, so be careful when buying on amazon,Absolutely see throughThis product should have been made with a liner.It is not just the case for these specific PJs, it seems by law all wider-cut PJs have to be flame retardant.This is not good if you are seeking some type of absorbent quality from the socks.where stiff and not spongy and mfortable like most wedge flip flops.Good quality, looks nice.The mesh did not feel mfortable.Cute though and very soft.Too bad b/c it's a nice lor, perfect v neck.Good material.It's beautiful though and I truly wish everything worked out fitting wise.It is clearly not leather.It may have leather on it somewhere but it's not one solid piece of leather.I returned it due to that fact, but it was still great quality and very cute.Better quality than I expected.Lightweight, mfy and cute.Super lightweight, they won't hold jewelry stable so I had to mount to a base to keep from falling.Nice soft, stretchy material which I liked, however, it was poorly made.Cute idea but not produced well.It's beautiful, and I want to keep it but it doesn't have the bonus mpartment stated in the description.It's cute in the picture, but doesn't nvey.Just doesn't look that great.The stume itself was made very well.The rest I uld've gotten on my own and been more mfortable.These are advertised as being able to keep you dry.Very sheer, so more made as a mpliment very up for the beach.also the material is not as expected It's not well made.There are no interior pockets at all for organizing stuff.And the expandable top and side handles are not very sturdy.The material was mfortable to wear however the design of the dress was not right.I did like the fabric.It fits fine but rides up, so I don't wear it.Material was not what I expected.I now have a medium sweater I can't wear if anyone is interested.Very cute and soft but sizing is inaccurateWill wear this to work in the yard or weekend lounge wear.It's a very strong, sour chemical odor.Maybe the leather is of low grade.Because of this, the wallet doesn't seem to be of high quality like many reviewers are saying.I'll see how well it holds up.Y'all need to make sure it is in good quality before shipping it our way.Still gorgeous cans buying another one.It looks so much better in the picture.Very nice strong material.The material is not great but you get what you pay for.I give it stars for looks, quality for the price, and affordability.I like how the product looks and I'm happy with it's functionality, so I'm hoping that the sewer-like smell will dissipate over a few days as I leave it outside to air.I wore these for a uple of months, hoping they would work as a cheaper alternative to the ones I had used for years, however in the end I went back and purchased the more expensive ones.Not well madeThe product itself is of good quality.I love this bag.I take good care of my personal items simply because I want them to last a long time, but this totally bummed me out.Worked flawless for months then died without warning.fabric lighter than I anticipated.Otherwise it was a good shirt.I love this because I love long sweaters.My friend who is heavy set had the same issue.The ring is made well.The stones are as expected for the price.If you are buying these to wear with something that is tight and uld help hold them on, they will probably work just fine.While these shoes are very well made, the heel is more like a wedge, which does not afford you much stability when walking.Love these jacketsThese are decent orthotics with adequate support/stiffness however these cane too narrow for my shoes.I've had this a uple months and it's still very moist and gooey.The shorts are mfortable but rub together when walking and make a lot of noise.I love the look of it, my only problem is that it doesn't feel secure like it should.It's a gorgeous hat I wish I bought soonerThe value matched the st.Like glue or a marker I got these last year and they worked fine, and it isn't like I wore them nstantly.First, these are very mfortable.However, the leg holes on them stretch out making them unwearable.So it uld be a fabric issue or who ever is in charge of the dark blues at the undie factory is asleep at the wheel.The fabric quality is good.Very light material and a little small in the chest.So if you like your skirts short this one will be fine.Not so flattering for a beach ver-up.very sheer, more of a nighty than a dressThe lors are nice but the fabric is not very flowy.Quality is a step or two below F.The frame is sturdy and I feel looks good.The view through the lenses seemed off and was not mfortable.I just didn't have the same view from all angles.First, the skirt is beautiful but the material it is made with is mpletely see-through when stretched.If you buy this I would size up and def wear something under it or pair it with a long shirt that vers your bum to avoid an embarrassing situation - in a well-lit room you will be able to see straight through.Not sturdy at allThese are not warm.They kept my hands dry but not warm.Well, if this isn't the most nspicuous packaging I've ever seen.Brobee pajamas.Shirt looks new but the tag was clearly ripped off on purpose and that is no good (It's ok. Rhinestones aren't aligned well along the edge of flap.But will be fine for the priceI know it's less than , so why mplain, but I do have higher expectations I guess for materials.It is very large with nice mpartments, I just wish it had been made out of better material.They're not very mfortable to wear; rub rash on my thighs isn't all that awesome out in public.There is no sparkle to the earrings, but they're okay for now since they're cheap ones..Not lace.While this has a good look on, it is definitely not lace.Very pretty as wellI love the way they feel-But I don't like the fact that they shed-all the time you If you walk on a rug r throw rugs.Fuzz gets on the Rugs, I have to vacuum the fuzz up.It sticks to rugs.Don't like the quality of the shirtNo good materialBummer: potentially lovely.The design on top is also a bit sticky; I would have prefered an all over soft touch with ol design.I now have to have it fixed before I can wear it again, not to mention I was scrambling to fix the mistake while out of town without something else nice to wear.Certainly not sweatshirt" material.They are warmis not exactly like the pictureI bought two of these, because I love alpaca, which is expensive, but worth it because it's so warm.nice looking shoes but its hard to secure your foot due to the additional tongueCute top however the string is too long and stretches easily.The material is of good quality.I would not have felt mfortable all night long in this dress.The grip definitely works well but it doesn't help if it peels off within a day.Quality is better than expected thoOk....,,,,the design are only for young teen to wearIt looks nice out of the package, but it isn't well made.Not as flattering as other designs similar to thisNot attractiveIt is made well, and I ordered a size up, as everyone suggested.Only good for tanningMost likely wonderful as wall der, but do NOT purchase with the intent of using the item.My Seiko has a metal link band that once adjusted is fixed at that length.If your watch has an expansion band, or a leather band that can be opened up, it should work for you.The winder is heavy and seems to be good quality.The back is shear and shows your full bra in back.Didn't like the fabricCompletely see through, only good for pj'sNot very well made.Do not enjoy the texture.Unfortunately and ultimately it has design flaws.The bottoms would not be my first choice and they did not fill well either so to me this is unwearable.It's just hard to find a good nnection for high quality shirts in this size.I'm '" and the length was good but the neck had no strength and this would be a lazy at home where no one would see you type of shirt.If you make the improvements on thickness and durability please do let me know but for now.The elastic doesn't hold it up very well.Other than that it's a cute top.It was not a good quality fit.Otherwise, The product is very nice.The fabric feels like an old curtain it's not as flowing or as mfortable as it looks in the pictures.The shoes were gorgeous, and my year old loved the sparkle on themMy daughter was only able to stand them on her for about minutes, which was sad because they matched her fall dress so well that we were having pictures made in them.Returned Quality was not as expected.When I received the dress the measurements were slightly off which I measured again myself and had a seamstress measure to make sure I was doing it rrectly.Material isn't soft.I don't care for the material it's very thin so if your skin is super white like mine you can totally see thru the shirt (Really cute shoes.It you aren't planning to fold or pack the hat it should work beautifully.Normally the products I buy from Amazon are quite good and while the quality seems reasonable, I cannot understand why when I place these XXL shirts up against my medium shirt they're a nearly perfect match.There are more expensive versions that are a much better allocation of money.Other than that, they're great quality.Very pretty except only two dandelion seeds in globe.One star because they fall down after a few steps of walking, but gave it the extra star since they are somewhat warm.These are not the best quality, but work for a party or Burning Manbut quality is fineThe gems r falling out.Ok quality.Was hoping for a more luxurious product.I guess you get what is expected for the price- too many flaws in the material.not as expected, material too lightThe ring is quite attractive but the finish doesn't stay shiny.Not so great for the self-esteem (.Wish it was better quality.Not great qualityWell, I've used it for months now and I have to say it works fairly well.The shirt feels mfy but also again with looks isn't of a batwing style.super soft but didn't me in the lor I wanted.These shoes fit well and are super cute BUT they are not high quality.Other than that they're a good solid pair of plugs.Shouldn't have been a problem fitting me.was too heavy, did not look nice for the occationVery dainty and pretty stume jewelry.So when I bought this, I was not looking for a lot of support.It is a beautiful st but I am returning it.I was hoping this would have a ttony soft feel, but it is a shiny polyester and way too hot for summer time or any other hot climateWhen I was trying it on I notice that it somewhat was going as smooth as I would want.I would just save your time and spend the extra to get a body chain from Forever or something.I have many of the degree leggings however these are my least favorite.Look great,but the cross separate the send day have to perfectioner.I purchased this dress for my daughter who is ' about lbs.I didn't like the materialPros: Thick material.With all the stress and love) that mes about in caring for an infant, I don't need the additional stress that is required for putting on these mittens.These obviously help quite a bit in stopping those scratches due to the much thicker material.It definitely was not worth the price we paid for one single glove.I thought it was acrylic but it's not.It is nice quality, thick material, however it is not oversized and fits my head like a regular cap.They look great but they leave marks on your nose which is expected from inexpensive glassesAlso the design around the bottom stone has little tiny fake diamonds.They were well made.The fabric is the kind of fabric that will pill easily, and won't look nice long.This stume is not what I received.Although the hats were well nstructed they ship them folded length ways and flat.So try as I might to get the creases out and their proper shape back it's just not working.So it doesn't have the smooth flow it shows in pictures.The dress was very tight, and the champagne lor was very see through.Will not work for me to make a rsage for my sons homeming date.The stone will not change lors unless you touch the stone itself, meaning it will not detect your mood just buy wearing it because the under surface is solid metal, not stone.Not as good of quality as I would've expected either.Not happy about this jewelry.From a distance, it looks OK, but the person wearing it can sure tell that the quality is not good.It's a beautiful necklace, with extraordinary detail, but I ordered this in early June, and it's ming in mid August.Great quality warm socks, but definitely NOT long.Great idea and quality was fine didn't work out for us.Big wallet too fluffy for subtle back pocketAlthough it was a good fit, follow their size chart, fabric very stretchy, true to lor, what I got was not what I ordered.Since I uld not wear it, I can't attest to the adhesive quality.It's essentially a picture with a clear dome over it.Very cute otherwise.the fabric was also much different than advertised.Not even fake turquoise.That I understand, but there is nothing about these earrings that are any kind of turquoise.These earrings are Plastic" and we should have the right to not only know this, but to speak about it as well.Don't get me wrong I love Amazon.The product doesn't work well enough.Material is scratchy.The ring itself is beautiful.It looks like stume jewelry rather than an everyday piece of jewelry.Definitely NOT waterproofI really wanted to love this bra as it sounded like everything I needed in a nursing/pumping bra as I returned to work.Also, the support isn't great and I am moving all day long at my job and don't feel like it's enough.It is a cute bra which is very rare in the nursing/pumping bra world it turns out.Very ornate pendant with necklace, but this pendant was too large for me.The seams were not well sewn.I left it at stars because it was beautiful on.I liked the look for the bag because it seemed to have a lot of room.The material is not well made.Quality is not up to expectationThere aren't pictures for this product without pixelation for a reason.Ill wear it, but not as often as Id hoped, and if I gain weight, then this may be of more use.I like the fabric.This ring is every bit as pretty as it looks in the picture.Thought it was real silver.The idea behind this is wonderful, the execution however, was horrific, weird material that allows no breathability or room to wear underwear or a bra underneath without everyone knowing what you've got on.not happy with the shape or the quality, sent it back.Graphics are good.When I received this product, the material was beautiful, loved the light weight, and the pattern for the material.The glitter is a mess.It's okay, but SCRATCHY.Quality looks very cheesy for the price.Super scratchy/itchy material.When I opened my package all the material was slightly melted together as well.No quality to this product.Looks cute and it if it's perfectly, but after wearing it times, the zipper is broken.Which I would love to get fixed or replaced.Other than that pretty ol bagtoo tight, not enough verageBeautiful top.I absolutely loved this hoodie, its very soft thick so super warm the high neck keeps the ld out well.Not made properly.It looks better on the pictureNot made as well as i was thinking.So the quality wasn't great, but I liked the design.I do LOVE the pattern.I wish it was made with more substantial material... it would be totally worth it..Since the other stitching is failing, fixing the zipper would not have helped anyway.If only they had used a smaller stitch and a better thread.Not a great qualityStretches pretty good.Nice fabric.Also, the skirt floats up in the water and the floral decal is not appealing and rather juvenile.There's another necklace by Out of Print for the Great Gatsby, but my experience with this has me re-thinking purchasing anything else from this group.Might be suitable for kids.The print in person is cute like the photo though and the material is fine so that's why I gave it stars.the material is ol, soft, and fits mfortably; but the seams are already tearing and i only washed them once by hand.It looks great from a few feet away, was hoping to get at least one use out of it.Quality of jacket is adequate for the cheap price.I've purchased Cowgirl Tuff jeans in the past that were excellent quality, but these were not.Nice quality but they run small.Artificial beads/stones.A stone fell off the moon shaped one days after I received it.I love the material.Feels great on but when I workout they slip down from the waist.We are real people out here, with real measurementsIts a good idea but my hairties never stay on the bracelet.The material, quality, and nstruction is all great, however I've had to buy three different pairs all the same size to get one that fit right.it's nice but it doesn't stop in the head because is too heavy, don't worthThere are several pockets great for organizing.But it feels very mfortable.Took some fine mbing to make these look OK.These were offered as full cut".Not windproof...at all.It's single layer thin) fleece with no windproof liner.The photo looks much better than the actual product.If the nstruction wasn't so inferior it would be a nice piece.This shirt had a ol design hence why I bought it.I hope the rest of the socks will be high quality without anymore defects or problems.The ruffles on this dress didn't hit my curves like I thought they would.The material was great and the quality was also good.It took a long time to ship and I was not very happy with the quality.beautiful necklace but i had to discard it since it was already rusted.On the plus side, the fabric was very nice aside from not having an give to it)Everything underneath shows right through.Not for every body typeMaybe it would work for a dress that helps hold these in place, but for my loose, backless dress, I usually opt to go bra-less instead of adjusting these all night long.Material is pretty hard on the skin.I have no mplaints at all about the manufacturing or the materials.It all seems to be well done and with a high level of attention to detail, the material also seem to be really good, they do protect my feet and the outer sole is made of a very non-slippery material.If the dress was a different material I think it would make the dress perfect.Looks a lot cheaper than it does in the picture and doesn't fit for my faith piercing.not warm and zy like it looks.This is a cute outfit in the pic.More lycra feel than expected.Is fine for rain/ moderate weather but I am returning it because the zipper doesn't work.The string part in the back is not appealing to me in personThe earrings were not very good quality.These did look nice but unfortunately the product quality was not great.Nice tie clip but lost it the first night I wore it because it slipped off.I will be giving this to a child to wear.Completely sheer.The dress itself is pretty but I hate when you can tell it wasn't well made.The rings have a great design, but tarnish very quickly.Not the best pair I have ever boughtThe design and the material of the blouse was ok.Unfortunately the short handle strap broke after only a few weeks.This seems to be a quality product however it's too generous in the size and much too heavy to be worn any time other than during ld weather.Did not like the cloth feeling, the length or the general aspect.very mfortable, but SEE THROUGHGood fabric.Lovely design.The material looks and feels nice, but the size is an issue for me.its not exactly like the pictureThis is a great idea but the details are what will make you think twice about buying it.The set is a good value even though the shirt is no fit The rest fits ok and is of decent quality not fantastic, but ok And it's still a good price for everything without a shirt, so I was nsidering to keep it at first and just get a different shirt.It's pretty, but can't find a way to put in a picture for the gift.Cool design but would not work for what I intended which was outdoors hiking and camping.Mesh knees gave them breathability but I doubt durability.Great stretching material for the rest of the pant, gives ease of movement.Zippers look like they would be water resistant and that would have been a good thing.In the photo looks like a silky material well it's not it's stiff as a boardIt felt like nice material but did not look good on me.The shirt is amazingly soft even when mpared to other merino wool products.I've used it running a few times and as a base layer on light hiking trips.material not as expected and size not what was ordered.Hollow on the inside and simulated diamonds are not as brilliant in person as photo.To everyone saying it's a great belt I wonder if they got the same belt I did.Too much like leggings rather than capriThe stume is NOT the same as the picture.The accessories and quality is adequate for what I paid.The quality is not as expected.It is a very stiff foam push up bra style, like when you take it off, it still holds the same shape even though it's empty.I did not feel like this clasp would last very long.beautiful, but had to return because a stone was missing.It would be such a nice swim dress if there were more support on top.The material seemed as if it would stretch out easily and would not retain its shape after a few hours.It really has the potential to be a pretty blouse.it is not made of tton.Different style all together.Really cute and mfy.The ripped hats are not as good all around as the plain and striped hats from this same mpany.The quality of the ripped style hats is great.They are not mfortable.Material and quality definitely not what I expected but oh well, I would not buy it again, definitely NOT.And now, I'm left trying to think up ways to make this look good on me.Safety pins ahoyNot as cute as photo.PU LeatherIt is a good necklace for a huge fan like me.The little bar that you slide through the hole won't stay still.I expected this to be a little longer, and the material a little better.Use a better quality fabric your design is acceptable People like to be mfy on their clothes your is seethrou ok to b Pay more and be happy wearing your clothesOk lenses and good looks, but you get what you pay for.My skin is sensitive to certain metals, but if yours is not then you should be fine.Material felt fine, size fit fine, just the lor...I gave it three stars because it is cute and drapes very similar to how the model shows it.The black is perfect though.I love this septum but my skull is turning pinkAnd, they have an odor that I hope washes out.Good but I'm not happy with Quality and with the finishing of golden edgeThey do not work well with glasses at all.Cute design and made well.Looks good, but the material is sub par.Skirt is fine.They look nice but they are very unmfortable.Just look for something better.Cute otherwise so it's a shame.I liked the reversible design of the hat but didn't care much for the velcro that attached it.Nothing is wrong with this item.Doesn't look like the product exactly.If not, get one with better nstruction.Dress is cute and decent quality for price.I never buy children's clothes from China..details should have been more specific.They are beautiful and nice quality.I bought them for a vacation, where I was hoping they uld be worn out of the bedroom as lounging pajama's.Printing was off centerThese glasses are nice but a little bent from non padded packaging.Not quality fabric for this price.I had to reset both for better placement and after that the adhesive wasn't the same.Main part of dress high quality stretchy fabric.I uld not make this look good.....Its made of a material that feels like it should be used for weather proofing.This dress, it looks nice for the first day you wear it.Nothing will take the wrinkles out.This dress, it not worth a buck.Its only in the heel portion and the left insert is much softer than the right.For me, a solid insert would be much better.Comfy but tightNice patterns.At least my kids love them and will get good out of them at that price.They did not have the hardware on the straps assembled.cheap quality and not worth the high price.ol socksNice ring set, but turned.This is not a high-quality item.That said, now that it's here, and now that I've taken care of the strings and holes, its a pretty good-looking and warm at.The material is kinda nice.I got the style two which was beautiful fabric, loved itI was so excited that I found a style where everything tied so it was more adjustable.The gator clip attachments work much better than the other types because they don't me off easily and are more secure.Seams were not stitched cleanly and there was loose threads everywhere.My son gets a rash from the elastic that isn't vered with tton so I ordered these.Lace is ok. Should t have ordered as big as everyone said toTurns out that the Essential" briefs are % tton.It fit beautifully and did amazing things for my cleavageHowever, at the end of the evening every seam has these elastic strings sticking out.Cute design but not functional in the water.The material feels nice too.Cut was nice; I especially liked the style of the nursing top.I am '".This product is not made for those over '".The fleece lining is good, though.Ok if your just wearing it too look ol, or don't need much warmth.I found this dress to have an adorable cut but it just didn't work out for me.Love the style but the quality was not that great.While the fabric was flowy and fairly mfortable, the actual fit was NOT what I expected.The material is not as good as expected.Material wasn't well madeDefinitely the most mfortable underwear I've tried since my cesarean, but I'm a bit disappointed as I thought they would be much more supporting.I was worried it would be too tight but unfortunately it's much too loose around my tummy and doesn't feel like it hold my organs in place the way I need it to to move mfortably without pain.I use this item with a Velcro girdle but i still wish I uld find something that would hug that area a but tighter for better support.I was under the impression that i was to receive the pair King Queen) shirt when purchasing.I give it two stars for material and price, but this is not a cute blouse.This is a lovely sweater clip, and since I have a broken shoulder, I can't get one arm into my sweaters, so I thought it would be perfect.cute topNo way on earth is this a maternity DRESSWore them for a few months during cycling and walking to/from the car while letting my foot heal.Cute pajamasI have the exact same size from a different lor and possibly different material and the old one was much better quality and better support.I have big breasts so these shirts were not ideal.I wear them to walk the dogs to protect my skin from UV rays and bruises that happen so easily in my sixties.It fall apart too easily, but it was easy to put back togetherAlso, it should be noted that it's % polyester.Material was heavy; more suitable for oler climates.I would have liked it if the stones were smaller.Didn't like the fabric.Love the texture of these socks, but they do not have a top band around the thigh to keep them in place.It is not very figure fitting at all.Pretty thin material and you can't really wear it in public with out a bra and when breast feeding the nice thing about nursing tanks is the ease of feeding.But not with this top having to wear a bra under it.This is a cute jacket, but was too large for my taste around the waist.No actual mpression.Light weight thermals.Didn't care for the materialThe fabric does not breathe well in hot or humid nditions.They are super light and no support what so ever.I think they are very expensive for what you get.It feels like a bathingsuit.I thought it would feel like pajamas.It's mfy but I can't wear it around the house as I would have liked toSpring for something more expensive.Would be nice to know the material type The wine red" is more of a fiery orange but the snaps snap and the material is good.I love the case and the frames are really strong, but I got them yesterday and already have a scratch on them and I haven't even worn them onceIt's still cute but more for a formal event instead of the club.Nice fabric, but too small for this size woman.Silver is rubbing off.Very intricate and beautiful dial.Curved mineral crystal very ol.Meh quality.For the price the shoes themself were good quality.Great textile.Not very flattering or mfortable.It will be ol to tie dye or something I guess, we will see.Material is very thin and not as thick or of good as quality as I would like.Nice material but no support in the so called" bra.The quality of the dress is not that great.The grip doesn't hold my sweater very well at all.Foot odor is as good as gone, which is really neat.**updating my review to mention that I do not like the residual smell that has since wafted in my shoes.That, mbined with microspic print, makes it tough to follow.The quality was not good for this product.For the price it is okay, but a better quality duplicate can be purchased at H&M for .My biggest issue is a piece is already loose and ready to fall off.Other then that, it's a ol shirtThe frame is sturdy.Not nearly as nice quality fabric as I expected, and very see through.love the pattern thoughIt was also kinda baggy done there and wasn't mfortable to walk it.Good material though had it fit rrectly I would have kept it.Its a nice dress but the material is very thin and the dress is to long.I bought these for my wife who has certain textile allergies.She said they are definitely mfortable, but they are absolutely NOT % tton.More research nfirmed on their actual website when it states: MATERIALS:mbed tton spandex elastane % for this particular set.The fabric was thick and not the most mfortable.I wouldn't remmend this hat even for the price because it wound up in the trash soon after I bought it.Very good purse, very good quality because of its material, but one of the hanger broke the first days I used it.Definitely a cheap quality knock-off of a licensed original...NOT WORTH THE MONEYBottoms are nice howeverNot as beautiful in person.Stitching off.I sewed it back on and added a zipper in the back to get it on and off more easily, which saved the piece in my opinion.The leather was decent rough on the inside, smooth outside and what I expected based on other reviews.I love the design and lor, but I just wish the midsection piece was a bit longer /Now the dress fits, however it is defective, the seam on the left side is uneven and looks bad not sure if I'll be able to wear it...The floral pattern is nice but overall I do not like this top.This particular style has not met my expectations.More importantly, she is getting blisters and red spots everywhere.The feel of the fabric was fine but the sizing was way off by American measurements.Poor quality, broke within a week, but looks awesome, wife loved it at firstodd thing about these, they came as pack, white ones are mfy and roomy.Also, this is not my first pair of Tony's sandals, they really do have a nice arch support nsidering they are flip flops.Maybe I am spoiled since my first few pair of toe socks were the injinji brand which btw are absolutely amazing i nthe realm of socks)For the money i would HIGHLY suggest buying or pairs of quality socks and forgoing these.I'm happy it is inexpensiveThe plain fabric is nice and soft, but developed those fabric pills very quickly after washing.These shoes look very cheap, you would think that for . they would look a lot better.The material is lightweight.Totally not worth it, cheap looking.Gloves had holes in multiple places.. Scarf and gloves looked greatQuality not too good and sizing is way offAnd there's no clear slot for ID.The hat itself is a pretty design.The send or third picture should show the jewelry flat footed when viewing the jewelry foot ware.I did not get to upset because the price is inexpensive so who cares.Did not look very good on her.Very cute, but not sturdy.Not form fitting.The stone was out my friend had to glue it in.Not a mfy sweater...Not flattering- might try it with a belt.Was not happy with this item.Didn't like the material or quality.No mfort at all.Maybe a bunch of washings with some fabric softener would help.My bust sits on its own but because they are larger I had less fabric to work with and had the to deal with rolling or mpletely ming off.It's beautiful, but not what I wanted.They're mfortable but I'm ' pounds and my thighs have a muffin top and you can see my legs through them.Good nstruction.It was exactly what I was looking for.I didn't like the material at all.Not as cute as the picThe material is not quality.On the model, it looks a lot more flattering mpared to how it looks on me.it's a little bit awkward especially since I put my wallet in the back pocket) Not too mfortable when you sit on it Lol.I love the design on the front and that's why I bought it but unfortunately I think that it was a little over priced for what it is.Looks bigger in the picture.One lens has a haze over it.Both of the brown stone plugs do not have the groove for the holding the o-ring in place, and the green plugs are much darker than what is shown in the pictures.I later found the wing on the floor.it looks better in the pictureCute wallet but you get what you pay for with quality wise.These earrings are really pretty and seem like good quality so I really wish I uld wear them.The metal frame is really good quality, but the print is just a sticker.It is more interesting, it's more advanced, has a nicely finished' border, which indicated and follows a finished' braided style, which is quite nice.It's not worth the plastic it's wrapped in.It didn't feel sturdy.The material not that durable.Diamonds are falling off.Will need to super glue but it was great just to see how it would lookCute earrings, not good quality, came to me with little scratches all on them.The shirt is not well made.Nice weight and style.It is indeed a beautiful shirt, though.The fabric is very sheer but well printed.The reviews on this item must have been plants because no sane person would want this purse once it was recieved.It's see thru and a silky, shiny material.The butt area is too baggy and I have hips for days and the bra... oh, God.There are redeeming qualities that warrant my star review: the red lor is gorgeous and the stomach section with the wrinkles is very beming.These boxers are clearly higher quality.The soft material on this underwear rides up very easily.I expected this vintage gown will be great as the photo here.The blue lace layer also seems like something not done yet, it's not artistic.But when you nsider how inexpensive it is, that's to be expected.Still a beautiful septum ring, however.They have a very wide, tight fitting elastic in the waist.the material was nice, thick and soft.Not a good look in my opinion.Keep a lint roller nearbyPink fuzz EVERYWHEREI am upset because the material is super ol as in stretchy and a rubbery texture).The shoes fit and look just fine but, they have a very strong and overwhelming odor of what I can only guess is glue and other petroleum products...NOT GOODThe quality of the fabric, lace and stitching is quite nice, but not the sizing.Run a little big, but great fabricIt seems like there isn't enough fabric for full verage for at least a C cup.Decent quality for pricethese look great and were a wonderful price but the zipper broke within hours on every single one.for one earring it's a pricey, but looks good.This melted.Is baby blue and white good material an quality unfortunately it runs very small.I absolutely love them.It wasn't properly smoothed down, and I worry about how porous and bacteria retaining the material is.Was not good fabricThe material is not as I expected.Probably best worn for showing off to someone who will be taking them off, soon.Looks like fashion jewelry and not silver.Didn't fit me well and fabric was hard to get wrinkles outQuality was good, tho.Well made and good material.I uld have purchased some just like them for at the Dollar TreeThe design is cute and my granddaughter wanted it.Quality was normal running rain weight.It was not mfortable to wear all day.not good quality of the productNot well made at all.I love the design, I love the quality, the material feels great, but, when I tried it on, the bottom is a little tight, just a little and the top was lose.Not water proof or even water resistant.I wanted this to be perfect it was for my daughter's Elsa stume.Also fabric is different then the genie bras I've bought before.My genie bras I do have have "genie bras" on the tag, these do not.Really not soft enough to sleep in.What I received is a black G-string teddy with fringe.I can't really give a decent description on this product, because I didn't receive it.The material is very pretty and soft but I don't know who they fitted this on before deciding on the measurements.I am too tal ''' for these stockingsThe printing was not centered.Flexible boning bowed out.Not good mpression or supportIt does ryn small and the material looks shiny and not the highest quality.I like the fabric very much, but the underwire doesn't fit or feel right.I'm exchanging it for one without an underwire.The item was no what I expected acrding to the description.I was looking for sth warm and this looks like sth for the summer time.The rest of all the items I bought were excellent.I loved them until they faded the first day.The material and lor was nice and of urse since I'm short, I would've needed heels.I was able to put the tank top on without difficulty.Spanx tank tops have changed and do not give the support like they use to It looks much better than it is.The material is not what I hoped for.they are mfortable, however, very fragile wore them once and it has a run in itit is really cute, just wish it would have fit (It was too hot when I tried it on in -degree weather.The quality was what you'd expect for the price.I think that it can be repaired, but I would have hoped that the craftsmanship would have prevented the seams from splitting apart after such a short period of time.the rd is not the same and its just not good quality like it once was.(white and gold beaded cuff) I have a problem with each of three items I purchased from this seller, and can't begin to say they were in the least operative, pleasant or helpful about it.It's too bad, I think with a little more care and perhaps more time, these bracelets, or cuffs as they're sometimes called, might well have been very nice and even wearable...Besides this it does look nice, I just don't see it lasting very long.Great quality, but I bought it for me and it only fits my year old.I'm thinking that with all of the other great posts about this product that it is possible the material was recently changed.If it weren't for the hood, I'd give the rest of the outfit stars for the price...If you have and chest at all this will not work for you.The material is also pretty easy to see through.The material is nice and thick, but it is WAYYYYY shorter than they let on, and I'm only '''.If you are on the search for stylish palazzo pants these won't cut it.The material is nice to the touch but the thread unt is so low it resembles cheese cloth.The bar is too short for going through my cartilage, but good for earlobes.My sister loved it so that's all that matter.not silver the Tibet silver needs cleaningAlso, don't expect the texture or lors to be as nice as pictured.The quality of the bag is great, very raw but genuine material for sure.Reading those reviews of how ppl uld pack their few days clothes and laptop in it is certainly questionable as I can fit my ." laptop with only great difficulty.The material feels cheap, a little spandex feeling, but it actually looks fine on.Item took forever to arrive and when it arrived the paint on the side was not finished.silver washed off in a weekHeavier fabric would have been much, much better.Made okay nice material but doesn't form fit to your body.Seems very well built though.ok quality.Beautiful look but inside lining feels like paper.I bought it to wear under my off the shoulder shirts that I bought to wear this summer.No a good design at all.Cute but earrings are very bendable not high quality, came quickly thoProduct is great, just what I was looking for.The leggings are definitely warm but they do not stay up.The straps won't stay upThe at is very nice and I really liked it but I had to give it away because of the fit.Minimus have been fine as s for me.Not nearly as mfortable or close to the ground as previous models.I did not have a good feel for the ground, like i did with previous models.Previous models were cheaper and of higher quality.Not well designed.Does not wind easy.This was a nice material and very pretty lor but it was gigantic.Material is a little scratchy but is pretty and does drape nice.I purchased these panties form review trader on a whim.Really cute designand well made.If you're shopping for the fabric/because you enjoy the pattern, you're set.So these were warm and not mfortable.All in all not a good pair of underwear in my opinion.This had no chance of fitting my pandora bracelet.It's not very soft and the quality isn't greatFor the price I was expecting it to be of good qualityHe has NEVER been sensitive or had skin issues with clothing, food, soaps, etc.I'll sleep in this bra and maybe do yoga, but that's it.Perhaps the smell would me out after a wash or two, but wasn't worth keeping around to try.It's cute, not exactly like the picture.The lace is not as nice or as well sewn into the shirt.Do not think it will be durable.I'll just keep it as a soft night shirt for the summer.All but one of the items in the box we received were silver.Bought this for my formal and it was beautiful but too big and the fabric appeared more expensive in the image than it tangibly was.Maybe one day i'll get it tailored for me.but i won't be doing that because of the wholes that i found on my new" product.If this was a thicker material as it looks in the photo then it would be awesome.Not great quality for use daily.Humongous on my child wears a solid T in everything but these will for her in a year or more.Very beautiful necklace, but it broke less than a week after I gave it to my girlfriend for Valentines Day (This is a silver filled ring.Would be cute if the lil flowers didn't pop off as you were putting them on your luggage.Not as nice or cute as foto.It should have gotten star from me but it looked good on others so I gave it more star.NOT THE MATERIAL I THOUGH IT WOULD BEDidn't like material...Material is top notch though.The fabric is nice.Wasn't happy about the material.Not really a tummy support, more for the back.The material was fine, the pattern was lovely, the length was perfect and the fit around the waist/hips was ideal.....but wow.... it was made for someone without a larger chest.I thought it was more like sweater material.Bought these about months ago and liked it initially.The bottom, skirt area, super cute, it flares, etc.I was looking for a canvas bag for daily use.They're everywhere.Otherwise, good quality shirt.The quality of the fabric seems decent for the price.Maybe this would look better on someone with a more voluptous figure.Real cute but strap is cheep lookingThe tool works okay, but with the rounded base, It is hard to line up the watch band in the tool.This one is really inexpensive but I don't think it is worth the little money it sts regardless.It's beautiful but not mfortable.The band looks fine and the quality is good.The reason for my star rating is the band was delivered without the buckle.Fabric was thin, soft and lor was vibrant.Would have been nice to have snaps to keep the tail in place when using a monofin.They need better sticking on delicate fabric.Shirt is cute, but the quality of the liner is not good.Quality wasn't that great, received my visor with scratches.Spend a little more for better quality.had to buy lace to make longer does not fit as in pictureThese are super cute to wear a few times.Leather band itself was nice and impressive for the priceBecause it was lace I wanted to make sure it fit and uld have a layer underneath.The tank top is nice but too expensive for something I uld have paid less for.Not happy at all with the quality of the productThe style is nice, I'm just not interested in stretching at all.I love the look of this, I have it with a green stone.Great Pattern but the fabric is not enough to get proper verage.I loved the skirt too, the pattern was beautiful and the material was very sturdy and soft.Very sad as otherwise the shirt is very nice.Dress material is good quality and the body fits nice as well as the length.Loved the softness,Still pretty though, and the glow-in-the-dark feature works better than I thought it would very bright even though it's small.I had to hang the pendant on a spare chain just to be able to wear it.This is a great shirt if you like to iron.The quality surprised me too; not what I expected.Looks great, real simple style and no blaring brand name tags/labels.All other types of suitcases/laptop bags I was looking at were at least  but I decided to try this really cheap one in mparison) as a trial run.Its a nice skirt.So I ordered a and both were too small so now I have to order a and in ivory it isn't prime and its for my dress I am changing into when we start swing dancing at my reception.I bought this because I thought it would be a perfect travel wallet- and I uld use the mpartments to put money into different budgets" such as food, entertainment, transportation...etc.Beyond the fact that it doesn't hold very much the quality is not good.The faux leather is very cheap and would not hold up for long under the best of circumstances, let alone traveling throughout Asia.When i bought it, it looked amazing.Smooth fabric.Cute design, wished the quality was better.Soft, yes, but it doesn't matter how soft they are if they don't fit.They are cute but the hair tie doesn't stay on it.I love the design and material.Bathing fits okay in the body but in the breast area wire is very firm.the quality was nice.It is really warm and really long.I've only worn it once....The fabric is far more stretchy than I anticipated although soft to the touch.The back band was extremely loose, again I followed chart provided by seller, and the cup/getting area was fine, more verage than anticipated.Strings hanging.The buttons are a nice ncept for feeding, but I think it's easier to buy button up pajamas.Very very very skimpy and revealing.The embroidery is nice though.the strings snapped after I wore it once... Not worth the money.It felt like a good quality swim suit, the material was nice.Once I do what I do as in this picture the end of the scarf is sitting on my chest.So, if you are short and want a long scarf that mes down to your hips, this is your scarf, and you don't care that it is NOT warm and you need a hat with it.)The wind blows right through this thing, so you need to wear a warm hat too.The appliques had to be sewn/tacked down as they weren't secured to the stume very well.The dress is lovely, however the under dress is not long enough and easily rides up making the dress see through as the over dress layer is a mesh with the sequins and beads.Wasn't mfortableThe ball stays in place.It is really cute and nice material.Other than that, they are a beautiful piece of jewelry.Spanx gave me the tight support while also shaping me back to pre-pregnancy size.The design is great, but manufacturing and materials aren't the bomb.I'd also be willing to pay more for more durable materials.The description needs to be changed.On the upside the quality looked to be good.It feels like it's made of lead, so I don't want to touch it or have it touch my skin.It's not feminine at all.Good quality T-shirt, but print was way off center.very form fitting.The design is cute.the price was good the quality is not that muchMaterial is too thickNot as sturdy as it uld be.This was made for a teenager not a woman.Yes, it is soft and flowy, but it's nothing anywhere near natural.These are very loud, and glossy glossy fabric, % polyesterit's not what I was expecting looks different from the pic, it is gold thread not a lace appliqueI have to have it altered.Chain is very light duty.Top is too short but quality good for priceSoooo the top will be given away as a gift but the bottoms are cute and can be paired with any top.I liked the bracelet a lot, nice big stones, very pretty.Unfortunately it broke after about two weeks.We did not expect them to last forever but certainly longer than months.They're also a bit long and since they are soft and flexible, you can't really cut them down, without miss shaping them, like I planned to.This was great for months.The straps on the shoulders were placed so that they are a raised loop.The tunic is beautiful though.Wish it was a better fit as I thought it would be loose and mfortable.On top of that I uldn't get the lighter to work and yes, I know how to use and fill butane lighters).The fabric wasn't great.But fabric is goodThese ties are decent for the price but don't get them if you're in a hurry to receive them.This watch has no water resistance.I bought a wooden Topwell with a round case and it holds up to moisture much better.The material was great though, very soft.Looks great and good quality, but made too small.Not happy with the blouse.Other hats without the mesh were much better at retaining their shape.I breast feed my little one and uldn't keep it on while feeding.It's too much work taking it on and off with the frequency of sitting.It does provide support when standing but uldn't make it work for me.The socks look good, but developed holes after a single use and wash.Very Canadian tuxedo, not soft washed semi-denim shirt.Price quality good tho.Besides the fit it was a beautiful swimsuit, vibrant lors, looks just like the picture, and seems to be fairly decent quality fabric.Price is good, fabric seems ok quality.I feel this ring was not up to the typical Pandora standards, the stones were not sparkly at all.the material it was not what I was expecting.Did lift my butt up nicely once I cut the wires off the top.It's beautiful in the picture.Execution of design not so much.the smell took over the whole house and just wasn't safe for the baby.the shoes were cute, fit right, and in good ndition otherwise, but the smell wasn't safe for the baby so we tossed them.Very thing framed girls might look good in this.And i didn't like the material.Necklace is pretty and looks more expensive than it is.Its a nice shirt, well made and nice material.Very firm.I liked this top it is decently made for the price, but it is too small.I just wanted a really loose summer top I can't leave the house in this.I have an enormous chest all natural) and actually got this to help support my back, as well.I didn't have particularly high expectations given the price and was adequately satisfied.Watch strap feels good and looks good too, BUT it stains the wrist everyday with a brownish tinge.... Wouldn't buy one or remmendI am a huge fan of Harry Potter and i love these types of bracelets so i figured i would mbine the two and purchase this.The fact that I have to repair it after only having it for less than a week should speak volumes about the quality of this product though.I promise it will me out much better quality.As they are priced in the stocking/tight range, anyway, buyer expectation would be better managed.Shirt seems decent quality.horrible.... only looks good on walls.That's a real nfidence booster.I bought it not for a beach bag but to use to hold knitting and sewing supplies.Looks beautiful on the picture not as great in person.The two-tone frame is painted silver--and not painted very well.The chain is bright silver-toned and this doesn't match the antique look of the rest of the cameo.love the print and the feel of the material, just not made very well.The ropes are not looking good at allGold plating doesn't last long Not bad for a weekend funIt looks better in the picture than it does in the hand.sturdy glasses but the flowers are extremely delicate they are almost play dough type material you have to be careful with them flowers will fall easyBut the material is nice and sheer.Does not look well made.fragileIn theory, the purse would be nice, but the quality is just not quite there, unless you want to buy another one in a few weeks.It looks beautiful as pictured.Gave it to my year old grand daughter to play with.Feels like a medium.First off, the material and design of this is SUPER cute...if you can get it onThe texture is simply not at all what I wanted.Completely see-thru.I was hoping for something more feminine and flattering rather than boxey.They are really thick and warm and appear well made otherwise I would have rated the a .The body is perfect, but there is no cup roomPlus they say % tton, but they are not soft at all.Fun, but low quality socks.The material is soft, but the item is mot great.Not happy with the quality and fit of the sweater at all.There will be some days that I will be able to wear this but it won't last long or at least won't hold up under the weather and wearing.you get what you pay for..this is TRULY a ribbed knit long, long tank top...Many women like myself are into more vintage clothing.I loved how the breast area would beme more lifted and a little more of a focal point than most dresses out there.The pattern is off center it fit okay but thought it would be a little better qualityThe overall quality of material is good.Wasn't the most mfortable thing to wear, unless you don't plan to any kind of moving at all.Cute but I don't like the material..Very nice hat, but if there is a breeze it will blow straight offIf you're tall, this is not the nursing bra for you.The rest of the bra is mfortable, but the straps just make me too unmfortable and I don't wear it.Print and material were as expected and made wellThe back of the bottom is not lined so it is transparent in bright light.The picture looks way better than the actual product.Not good material to workout inPlus I don't think they had an elastic waist.So, if you are blessedly lacking in breasts and are overall a pretty slender and short person, then I think this would look adorable on you.Love the style of the shirt, light weight, but durable looking.Thee design is very fashionable, but can wear casual.The soles lasted about months before developing the first hole.The leather held up reasonably well, but the stitching is starting to fray.This little dress appears to be really made of thin material and does not look well made.While these are very mfortable, I bought them so I didn't have to wear a bra I breastfeed).The description sated there was a built in bra.it looked so lovely online but what I received was some washout pale purple cloth.NOTHING AT ALL LIKE THE BRAS I'VE PURCHASED IN THE PAST.However, the fabric is what really turned me off, just didn't feel mfortable to me.Hurts like a bitch my whole tounge is swollen hurts so bad I was swollen for weeksbut nice jewelrysFor stume purposes this in fine.The support cups are not fixed in place so they do move around when you're swimming...Thick, soft, quality fabric.Amazingly put together.I love the design except the metal part of the scarf spread all over my clothes like glitter.But seriously, pay a little more elsewhere for better quality.not enough room in bust area, workmanship was goodI was really upset because i loved the style and material of the dress.Just not mfortable to be wearing all day.Also, the quality wasn't as good as some of the other rsets I have bought from Camellias.The fabric didn't seem as thick and durable, and the quality of the boning wasn't as good as other rsets.It was steel-boning, but it felt more like a stuming rset.otherwise the glasses work well.where the two owls link together.Thought these offered support.... only good as an insert for bathing suit instead of foam padsI got it earlier than expected which was great but the quality is not what it appears.Pros: SoftIt's much nicer in the picture than it is when you receive it.It's a beautiful dress but it was just... off.It's two separate pieces.It is a crop top so be aware of that.I just wish they were adjustable or had a nnector.The neckline was too long and I don't mind that, if it was cut differently and better quality.No padding or structure.Expected this item to be fitting as the picture suggest) and it doesn't.In my opinion there was too much verage by the neck and chest.Much cheaper than I would have expected- I guess I got what I paid forSeemed to be made well which is why I gave it stars.Which will make you sweat more in the desert.Absolutely in love with this chokerThe sweater material was nice and the product was cute, if you can get the right size.I was truly so excited to get these leggings, they are outrageously expensive in a boutique.Sparkles flying everywhere.The silver straps in the front were not sewn properly.I really wish I had received this outfit without it so damaged, otherwise I would have kept it.While the case seems durable and strong I am highly disappointed in the quality of the Marauders Map printed on it.) It smelled strongly of chemicals when it arrived.They came very late and are not good quality at all.did not like the materialDoes not look good like in the pic.DO NOT GET WHITE if anyone still insist to get this product for good price, it looks like doctor at.Not mfortable at all Not happy It's not smooth under clothes makes me lol bulkierSo, if you look like the model and don't care about mfort then this is the party dress for youI know these shirts were inexpensive, I bought three but I figured they would hold up better then they did.It's a very cute sweater but not very mfortable.There is also no elasticity.I love the soft material though.The shirt itself besides the fitting is awesome.Somehow the design looks appealing but did not flatter me as much when I wore it.It may look good on some people, just not for me.The overall material/ fabric is ok. Cheep looking but alright.Not a great quality shoe but I didn't expect it to be for the price.While the case is beautiful and provides adequate cusion for my daughters laptop the strap that they show with the bag does not actually work.Material is see through.I uld have received much better quality from a big box store.I have had this bead on my Pandora braclet for only two weeks and I have already lost many stones.I am ' and have a longer torso so it did not work well.The unt was accurate but the product was very cheap but for the price it is what it isThe fabric is a mesh style, which would be very nice in the summer, not so much in an air nditioned office.There's no cupping" action go on, if you understand the reference.The pattern design is simply another t-shirt layer on the top-side, so layers on the top of hand and layer on bottom of hand The packaging was beautiful and its presentation would look nice as a gift.Flat like a board.Visible under your clothes.I would have given it a higher rating were it not for the setting, which has either tarnished or the silver lor ating has worn off.The actual dress wasn't far off from the photo, I noticed some innsistencies when it came to the cut, but overall it was pretty accurate.I loved the belt but I would not buy again because it needs to last longer than a year.I think these would work fine out in the ld.Also, they are not soft on the ears at all.The fabric design is awesome, and the fabric itself is light but very nice.very skimpy material.Long enough but elastic around the waist does not keep them up.After receiving my package I love the purse I had one problem one of the zippers were damaged because I needed it for traveling I decided to keep it because I have no time to return it.They are nice and warm but WAY thicker than I would like and they leave tiny fibers EVERYWHERE all over your hands and everything.Style is perfect but not form fitting, material is too stretchy like that of cheap yoga pants.It made of multiple strings that your finger can go through it Looks very good in picture It is a cute accessory that I look forward to wearing longer.No curves are shown like the model pictured.The socks are beautiful, but have a much more synthetic feel rather than tton.Nothing stretchy here.One of the diamonds was off when it arrivedDon't expect a good quality product.it does look what it sts cheap) but can use the chain with any other light silver metal pendant.They are long, which is good but to make them more mfortable I have to hike them way up and its not flattering.Material is nice.not great quality.the back has a loose spot,it does NOT hug ur curves what so ever but it is great to sleep in i ordered a small im ' , years)form fittingmaterial is not good.stone was loose in the settingI was so excited for this dress but it was just not well made.The stitching it not centered on the hat.My first pair was absolutely fantastic and still holding strong to this day.I will stick to my Wal-Mart Faded Glory shirts that fit perfectly and are super mfy for wearing by themselves or layering.The picture makes it look better than it is.The material is nice.Very cute and good quality, but made for women with no boobs at all.I loved this saying, but yhe material is so thin it can not be used as a bib, everythinf goes right through itI don't like the material much I wish it's better qualityIt seemed perfect for summer.I love the pendant thoughI expected the stones to look better than they actually do.Waist too high, not much support.I own a juicy one piece with ample bust room.These shoes are gorgeousIt's a shame because they are beautiful.It is a beautiful dress.Completely see throughThe price is cheap and I didn't expect it to be of the highest quality.I guess I should've spend a bit more for a better quality product.lThe dress was well made and beautiful beading.Blouse appears to have good quality.It's a nice shirt, but mpletely different than picturedI don't like that it wrinkles easily, it always looks like it needs ironed.Very little ntrast between logo and Tee shirt.The hair tie doesn't nsistently stay in the bracelet -(The price was low though so I kind of anticipated it not being the best.Not all of us can afford real diamonds and gold but we still wanna wear some sparkleIt did seem like a super cute and flattering design and of great quality, especially for such a fair price, though.The lor is more of a tarnished gold than true silver.The dress looks much better in the picture.Just doesn't look good.Smells like oil or chemicals.I loved the ring the fact that it'd adjustable but the crystal fell out after only wearing it times.this shoes its beautiful onThe material is nice quality and seams nicely made.The sizing is great, and the fabric is nice and thick, but the stitching came out almost mpletely after the first wash.It looks like decent quality fabric though which is the only plus.As beautiful as this is, it cannot be worn easily because of the smell of the fabric.It is a very beautiful design and we regret not being able to use it.Not that great of quality and would definitely not keep you warm.Beautiful glasses, but too right behind my ears.I'm a strong independent woman and don't need the validation of a manufacturers tag to make me feel sexy.Only giving a star rating because the fabric felt soft.Not great quality and not worth the price.One pair was fine.The other arrived fine but the seam came out after about a month.Material is ok. Stitching is not of the greatest quality though.Looks better in my opinion.Material is very stretchy so make sure you get a good size, shows everything back rolls, stomach pooch, bra strap marks.Sunglasses are stylish and well nstructed but the lenses are very dark.The material is stretchy and looks to be about the quality of my Bali's.For me, I feel these panties deserve half a star for effort by the mpany only.If you just need a tacky hawaiian shirt, however, this is a good buy.Not warm enough for a ld Montana day.The fabric is also very silky which I am not a fan of.There was a itty bitty hole on it, eh.These were not nearly as stretchy and mfortable as the capri pair I have.Not happy with the top as it was VERY see-through.But I love the skirt.We had the Hilos in navy/green lining and my son wore them for over s year and they were his favorite.If I can't find a way to get rid of the smell, I can't wear them, which is a shame since they fit well and washed well.Aaaagh..looks very inexpensive :(These have a VERY STRONG odor like kerosene fumes, or a strong chemical smell.I'm just not happy with the fumes from them.My granddaughter picked the Pink boots they are adorable.And the detail isn't very neat.I do love the fabric though, it is very soft and silky.. just not sized appropriately.Physical shirt is great, but the screen-print itself is extremely off-center and not even parallel to the hem line.These bras are nvenient with the front zipper but definitely made for women with no chest.Fit as expected, mfortable to wear even at night time.After every laundry the foam caps are out of place.Will I ever find a swimsuit that vers, supports, is mfortable, enomical pretty?The skirt vers very nicely.The ear-lobe expert did not work well for my ears, they did not attach well and the hanging earring did not hang well.The product is fine.This is a nice necklace however I expected better quality.It looks like nice metal, and the little turquoise piece is pretty.Not very supportive and the opening is not too mfortable for nursing.. the Army seal is not straight on the front.I had to sew it together the keep in the spot that fits me.Me as an Army Vet I'm very particular to detail and the detail of this hat is way off in my opinion.I'm not very happy with this hat because of these defects.Within two weeks the inside surfaces are pealing off.Sleeves are too tight, the patches on the elbows are not placed rrectly and the material is not great quality.Doesn't look like the picture only thing that is true about the dress is its suede material I wasn't a fan of this kimono.They look nice but are to short and irritated my skinPretty shirt.I had to return it because i feel that after some use, it will be stretched out.Otherwise GREAT material for its priceMaterial is a little shiny.But otherwise GREAT PRODUCTIt was soft and mfortable but didn't look so great.I thought it would be a better quality.The difference in quality and fit between these and the identical product I ordered months ago is remarkable.I would guess they are great for newborns who are less mobile.These are pretty toe rings, and you get a few for the price which is nice.This toe ring is not that ring.I will probably cut the cuffs off and see it it is more mfortable.I do love the material, they aren't see through, and are nice and stretchy.great belt.This style needs more body in the fabric to look good.Looks great on the model, but don't expect quality.I loved this piercing the rose gold is great and didn't rub off immediately.However, the price is really amazing and it's cute as long as you have a backupShe shirt is a great price, but was very large on my fiance.It would be perfect with a belt or long and flow but I can't do either because it stops at my shinsNot sure if it's the cut or the material that makes it look this way, because I've owned other similar skirts this that fit fine.Not a flattering shape.Good, strong elastic, strong sliders and buckles, I really wanted to like these.I was expecting a better quality shirt from Disney.Not water resistantNot a great quality.I thought the price was outrageous for one pair of underwear, but was willing to give it a try if it would help the revery process.Broke after a day but still look nice The picture of the shirt was much better mpared to the real shirt.Just received, not as cute as the picture, but it will be worn...If such a defect doesn't matter to you, then feel free to try to order one.I ignored reviews because it was cheap and I have a short torso so I thought it'd be fine but I honestly am not mfortable wearing it.Nicely appointed and well built with good fit/finish.Classy piece.I think this would look great on someone with more of an hourglass shape.. or if you're into waist training with rsets.Otherwise, the material and feel is good.It very cute otherwiseThis is a really cute top, love the pattern, but a few problems.It's just ok. A lot thicker than expected and not flowy at allI knew it wasn't real gold, but it looked a lot better when I put it on and I really liked it.He still likes them but they should have held up better.Maybe you should make note of the initial quality of the material before accusing customers of fraud.very fragileCute bikini.I was not expecting high quality when I ordered it for less than .A designer uld have adapted this and made it really ol.Not a huge fan of this skirt at all.Although the quality and look are very nice, this is not your typical backpack.If she picks it off there will definitely be a hole.The fabric seemed a little cheap but I would have worked with it if the size was accurate.This would look great on someone with a great tight, fit body.Pretty dress but it just didn't work for me.The neckline came up too high, not as shown in photo.The material is not what I expected along with the quality.Very sexy thong.I was looking forward to this necklace but it was not how I imagine it.I am going to remove the chain and change it do individual pieces to eliminate the busy look it gives with the layer chains.The bodice is nice though.Didn't like the material at all.Pretty pendant, exactly what I was looking for.The dress just didn't look good onI think it is over prized.I realized the chain Gold) was very light weight which is easier for the necklace to break.I believe they will break if they aren't perfectly hanging up.But for this necklace so far so goodNo support on top.For the price, I will keep it and see if washing it softens it up some but I doubt it will help.Definitely not worth the price, material is very thin.Looks like Wilma flinstone's necklace on little girls neck.On top of that when I would readjust it I later found out that the wrap around part wasn't evenly vering the shirt in the back which did not look nice.I also felt that it did not lay nicely in the front as it does on the model in the picture.I'm so disappointed because I really wanted a top like this but it is way too much work, it definitely uld have been designed betterI thought they would be more adjustable than they are but there isn't too much give.Fabric is beautiful, but dress is not adequately lined.:-( As well, the Om charm was of very low quality metal, just to fade to pper.FRAGILEThe pendant and ear rings stayed pretty and shinyThe fabric is nice but it snags really easily.The necklace and chain would be great if there were not some pitting dents) in the cross itself.Nice quality and very nice to have cheater section for reading.I would rather invest the extra money for a quality Bralette, then buy this againIt's a bowling ball bagI thought the material on these would be tton, I'm not at all sure what the fabric is.not what I expected, the material is not good for wearing to go out.I wind up using it as a night dress to sleep.Don't like the quality of the materialdid not like the style and quality.The dress is made just fine, but I would prefer a better fabric.Had they been stitched I would have been totally happy.For what you get it's a good price, but wouldn't expect these to last forever.Made in China not the same quality of tton like those made in USA The shirt was extremely soft and would be mfortable if only it fit.... My friend loves it.No structure to this top.: The top is inexpensive, but so is the quality.The tail was very nice with the pearls and I used it with another top.Everything fits good and for the most part looks good.Adorable print; good fabric.The suit is pretty but not high quality material or workmanship.Nor are they windproof.They light up for safety purposed but they are a little tight not he shoe.funky llar dimensionsNot seamless.The material was ok.Design is cute and fabric is nice thoughOnly pro i have about it is the design which looks niceIsn't soft in the shoulderquality not greatIts not manageableNice quality fabric.Looks great but broke very easily just wearing it on my vest after a uple monthsThe fabric its not good at allThis is the scratchy, stiff kind of pettiat, not the soft fluffy chiffon like the photo shows.But the quality if it is not what I expected.These socks do not stay up very well.But the quality matches the price.Since it didn't fit me I can't attest to the hold up of wear and washIt's cute and stylish, but if you have an ounce of curve it will be short (She loves them but I had to mpletely redo the clasps and chain parts.Received it broken but I loved the style The top did me up as high as pictured, which was nice for me since I'm a little bigger on top and wanted a more modest alternative to most swimsuits.Theyre bracelets are strong and beautiful for a reasonable price.I LOVE these socks ...These are too expensive to wear out so quickly.Beautiful lor and fabric but runs small.Sock were so warm that I uldn't wear them.Didn't like the qualityThe material is wonderful.The scarf is perfect.It was a Christmas gift and too pricy for my son not to be able to use it in the ld NY Winter weather.The overall quality of it is pretty good though.On the hanger" its beautiful, but it is a strange shaped jumper.Wanted to love them--the price is right--but the quality/fit just isn't there.Good for spring weather but not ld winter.also the steel bones aren't paticularly strong.It has a nice look but the sales price is the only saving grace.The dress is beautifulI don't like the fabricMy daughter has not worn them other than to try them on but the quality, at least, seems nice.The lor is great, but that does not make up for its deficiencies.For a Tony Lama brand I expected better quality.Lots of scratches on the leather.I taught it was tton, i found out it's silk shirt.Good watch band for the value, but quality is lacking.The LED light didn't work ( ..mother likes it, but threads me out when washed, had to be re-sown around the belt and sleeves..Band it too hard for kids to take on and off easily---would prefer velcro.The stone, itself is beautiful.I'm really only giving a star for the quality of the stone, and the prettiness of the design.Super price but the quality shows.I sewed it together eventuallyThe straps don't stay on.I gave it stars because the fabric seems sturdy and there is a variety of pockets.I have not been to the beach nor the pool so it's not the sea water nor the chlorine.the real ncern with this kimono is the actual design.This was not as appealing as it looks onlineI'm in a business ambient where I'm usually the only woman in the board room, so I have fun being unique.in the picture they look great.i love the idea of this dress and was so happy to find it on amazon at such a great pricethe quality of the material and the workmanship was excellent.It's a pretty dress but really needs some improvements in nstruction.Two days with her and goes from gold to silver.Decent idea, BUT Well it didn't fit bad, because the leg straps are soft and have no elastic in them they are looseAnd unfortunately as much as I was hoping I would love them, I have a tough time dealing with the mesh fabric.It's too rough, I was hoping it would have been more of a mesh type feel, it needs to be smoother and softer on your pieceThese pants look great in the photos, but you can tell the manufacturing is crap.As with the other pairs of Vionic I own, fit mfort are awesome but the quality of this pair has left me a bit bummed out.I wore these maybe - times over the months I have had them and noticed today the heal strap is tearing in a place that won't allow for repair.Just my honest opinion but the mpany should stand by their product for more than days.Good for the price I guess, but definitely looks very cheap.I haven't worn it yet and I don't know if I ever will....these are great if you have no rear end.The elastic waist band was not mfortable.The top part of this is very cute.This looks like a very mfortable shirt and I was planning on using this for a bathing suit ver up and lounge around wear.I was not impresses with the material it was scratchy and thick.Dress was nstructed okay but I had to trim a lot of loose threads.I wore it twice and washed and dried it in the dryer and the material held up well surprisingly.The picture and description are not representative of the actual product.I bought a strand puzzle ring to avoid getting a whimpy, thin ring...but a thin whimpy ring is exactly what arrivedIt was so cute, wish it would've fit meMaterial was good.The quality was great and the look adorable, but I bought a Large and then purchased a send one in XLarge but it still doesn't fit.It is more of a spandex instead of tton, so it's clingy/stretchy instead of loose and mfy like the picture and description claim.Since water drops gives it a stained appearance, you can't spot clean any spills.Nice quality sweatshirt and fit as expected but The print is muted.If you have sensitive skin, please do not take the riskThey're very cute and good quality, but they are not g as advertised.Very unattractive Returning Appears to be good qualityWhen I first got the hat it looked and felt great.It's probably okay for casual use, but it's definitely not good for extended outdoor use.In all honesty, I feel this shirt is over priced.Fabric flows nicely.Its mpletely sheer.Not exactly the item pictured on the site...The quality is not great either.Not high quality.Okay quality though.Does not wick and not soft.Did not like the material.I don't like this material at all.Low st but to heavy for a wedding band replacementI have several mala beads and love them.Nice design, plastic made to look like medal, not a reliable chain broke after two days, would only function as a lightly worn stume jewelryThis jacket is very nice and mfortable.The beading was gorgeous, but the tulle fabric used was not.Did not look good on.It doesn't look good as a skirt.The design is very ol and it is indeed stretchable.It is not, however, windproof by any means.Again robe is fine.This product is beautiful.Garment length " was too long and rolled in the back There was not an option for a shorter length.The top ruffle rolls up and does not lay well.Beautiful thoughthe price is too high for such a simple shirt.Please beware....the baby special size written months is years..ooooo it's not in anyway newborn...but overall very good quality.These look good enough but the top ball keeps ming off... On all of themThis was going to be a great mpromise.... because I don't like my stomach especially after having a baby.But they were very mfortableI did give two stars because the material seems okay and it is very pretty, but I wouldn't remmend this unless you have a really short torso and very perky breasts.Loved steering wheel ver upon arrival.I think it's a case of the picture being prettier than the actual item.If they are crystals they are low end.I returned it for better quality.Material is what I wanted.I buy a lot of Gerber, because the sales are ridiculously affordable, and am generally pleased.very hot not a ol shirtI think this is the first time when I've wished for plastic studs as opposed to metal, but wow are these heavy sunglasses.There are light weight alternativesThey literally weigh times as much as my favorite sunglasses.The fabric was soft and it looked great ming out of the bag but the size was all wrong.Fabrikay okay.Right after trying them on, I machine washed them on the gentle cycle.Other people seemed to have received a pair with better quality, but I guess it's just a gamble on this brand.These are cute and fit well, but turned my daughter's skin and shirt blue even after the first few washes including wash before the first wear).I also didn't care for the draping in the front.The skirt portion is good.The problem with the top portion is: .I have pictures but I can't see how to post.The pants are nice and mfortable.When I took the top from the packaging, I thought it was a pajama top.The quality of the print is rough and me off in the wash, acrding to reviews I was expecting a soft onesie, it is the same as any cheap regular tton tee, and they run very short length wise for babies body.Type of material that as soon as you start moving it stretches out and stays like that..It looks great but so cheap I don't know if I uld ever wear it anymoreI thought I would be getting I higher quality product than what I receive.The straps that hold the money are cheap feeling and I wish they were tighter with an electric feel.But what do you expect for such a inexpensive item?Headbands were cute, but not great.Just not good quality.I liked it when I saw it online, and I liked it when I opened it although it's a bit shinier than I like) but it falls short when I use it.Cute bag.I wanted to wear it at a wedding but I don't think I can wear it at all.The quality was good, but the sleeves were about an inch above my wrists.It something I can fix, so for the purpose I need it for, it works, but if your looking for a real at that will keep you warm, this is not your best option.You can see where the crystals are glued in.I had to at it in clear nail polish because it does turn me green.I think that if you had a VERY specific body type, it might look good.The material is very thick.It is leather however and the lor is niceShirt quality seems good, and the fit is right.It is well made and does glow in the dark.Strap looked really nice, when I received it, but it wasn't very high quality.Twisted holders and the lor was too light for my taste.They were meltedThe material is mfy.It seems well made and it's really pretty.The title description for this bag included the vital word LEATHER" and I bought the bag based on that description.Love the designs but the acrylic is just such a negative thing.The needles are good but the rings are cheepI was never going to wear it and gave it to my grand daughter.These uld keep your hands warm if you weren't in the snow.But hours after skiing my hands were wet.Stretches a bit after washing but it warms.It's feels very much like spandex.As if it's a top to go excersise in instead of casual wear.It looked bright although not as great in the photo.It is beautiful tho.Super ol, very hip, and they feel like upper end glasses.Very sturdy and the stylng of the packing and the case is awesome.The top fits ok I'm a C but the fabric is not the best.Of the with the elastic, the grey ones have a very tight elastic that cuts into the belly, so the black pair is the only one that fits mfortably.Wasn't the best material.pattern on shirt isn't biologically rrectToo loose at the neck and droopy at the neck.I am ' and it is a thigh high blouse.Seriously, it should be in near excellent ndition right now.The lace was the best part.Expected the fabric to be a bit thicker, felt nice though.not a warm" shirt for outdoors.- it's very easy to broken "<Unfortunately this broke within hours of me using it.I'm athletic build and it doesn't flatter my shape at all.. please save your money.The fabric is too bright.Three stars deducted for quality in workmanship.Good purchase if you are aware of possible QC issues.Won't work on haeaver material.I love the feel but not worth it to only hand wash.the cross slips out of the loop.The ring looked nice but the quality is lacking.I would remmend spending the extra money and getting something that's better quality.This dress is VERY sheer.their is a V" of fabric in the front and back making it decent enough to wear in public but the sides are still see through.Doesn't sit down well on head.The material is very soft and stretchy, which is nice.These would be so mfortable, except they are just too short on someone like me with a lot of bootyThese are great, if you only want to wear each pair once.This dress was truly beautifulThe fabric is soft, modest length, and well made; however, I had to return the dress.too big and not a great quality.It was inexpensive so I should of knownThank goodness this was so cheap, I don't think it would fit a yo.Super mfortable, but used it for weeks and started to see holes similar to the kind you get in leggings.Not durableThis product is better received on the ntinent of Asia and the nearby Islands.IT NOT WELL MADE WONT ORDER ANY MORENot real happy with this purchase.However, the watch is not water resistant AT ALL.While the quality of these seems to be pretty good for the price; when I got my package today it had the black, gold and of the aurora lored rings.The fit is okay but the material is not the most mfortable.These look good and if you're only going to use them for a prayer or meditation session they should be fine.She liked the fabric and design on the purse, but didn't think it would be worth taking the chance on losing things.The wallet arrived on time and was in excellent shape.I did not care for this belt.It was too wide and the leather was too soft.Really disappointed because it's a pretty dress, lace is really nice.But it was a beautiful dress.This isn't made at a high quality at all.I love it when Amazon products are optimal, but feel like a fool whenever they're mediocre or send rate.It smells funny too.Very, very synthetic feeling and thick/structured but clingy at the same time.The detail in the back is great and the neckline is flattering, but the fit as a whole just doesn't work.This is one very solid tool.If you want to remove easily removed vers, this, or a screwdriver would work well.other than that it was pretty perfect.The wrist strap is sturdy and the zipper is easy.Once the dress was on, and finally tightened up enough and tied, it looked really nice minus the huge bow because the strings are so long).I rinsed them in a mild soap.The white top fabric" part is not waterproof and also not washable.It's cute but not very good quality.It's not as cute in personI'll wear this around the house as it is mfortable, but I would go out with it on.Diamonds were not set well.While my wife like the size and feel of the ring, the quality was not adequate.Although the mpany gave me a send pair for free but they were still the same quality.shoes good but earrings are s***.Looks cute, but doesn't serve it's purpose very well.If you have any curves don't bother..I needed a suit for a waterpark so I needed it to be secure with good support for the rides.They are too loose as well.I am not talking about super thick wool socks, just regular blend socks.Lots of loose strings/threads hanging off And it is very see through up top, so don't wear under fluorescent lighting haha.Clean and simple linesFitting in the wrong places not as flattering as expected.They will not be worn.Expect better quality for the price.My body shape is hour-glass".I love the look of this bag.It is roomy and mfortable to carry however it is already flaking, the brown outer layer is rubbing off.Maybe if it was steamed it would look nicer.The top was as seen in the picture, but the bottoms were not cheeky or brazillian at all.The material is not of very high quality either.I think I would've loved it if the clasp hadn't broken minutes after I put it on.They are cute shoes, I'll give them thatLittle guy loved them but just didn't last as the glue holding the sole and leather together didn't hold up.Quality is fine, but the leather lor is not mplementary to the beads.The boots are absolutely gorgeous; but after a uple of hours of wearing them, the bow is hanging on one of the boots.It's pretty, but very bendy.The material seems to be good but can't tell for sure.After a few washes this doesn't look all that good.The leggings are fine, but they are this stretchy synthetic material that is not soft or breathable making it unsuitable for summer.The fabric was not amazing and had a ton of static which made it stick to my legs.Overall, it was cute but not very high quality.Columbia makes a far superior shirt when it mes to durability, mfort, fit, warmth....I am not sure I will ntinue to wear it.I had to super glue it back on.I am on the fence about this shirt.Not the hottest product, but for some reason I want to try it again.Material soft.I got it because the reviews were so good but sitting in it I feel like i'm going to break it.I feel like I wish I knew the dimensions of it before I bought it.Looks so much better on the model.If you are well built up top, this look is not goodI love this shirt.NIce Top..Great earrings.They are synthetic too.Not real dancer socks.This dress is not made of the same quality as the Black Orange one.I would have kept it, it looks great, but lost a stone the first dayThe material does not stretch but it's absolutely cute.When I received them finally, I felt like I was working in the factory to make them.Thankfully I also ordered Simplicity Women's High Waisted Pompom Tassel Trim Beach Casual Gym Mini Shorts which are a very similar style) and they arrived EARLIER than expected and fit PERFECTLY.No cushion, no support, no mfort.It's well made, though.There's - times more fabric than I need.The leather wore in extremely fast, and also made me wonder about how the cards are held inside, as there is a very defined inch line at the bottom of the wallet where nothing goes, maybe it's for change?When on though they did keep her hands warm and she liked them for playing in the snow.So dissapoint... my stone is not all purple like in the picture I know it has a good quality but is not like the pictureLooks cute online and much less cute in reality.And the leather is not particularly good quality, but I guess I would not expect that for the price.It might as well have been the / version of a crop top, which I do not look good in.It does not feel like it would absorb water well or hold up to washing.It is quite loose-fitting.Not as nice as I would have liked for the price Needs thicker fabric, the bottom ruffles a bit easy while on.Looks different from the picture.I have purchased a lot of Mud Pie clothing in the past and have always been pleased with the quality.I already had holes forming in and around the crotch as well as serious fading after just - wears.Sure it's a nice pattern, but it is not worth the money.Not pleased with the quality of this purse.Do not like fabric.Not sure how warm they would be if warn in the ld by themselves as I where them under some pretty heavy duty ice fishing bibs.They seem reasonable well made.I think probably all of us wouldn't mind paying a little above bargain price as long as we knew quality and longevity was there.But I digress bottom line these pants are not worth the priceObviously this is an inexpensive top and I did not expect it to be super amazing I just thought it was so cute I wanted it.Much too small for the measurements given on the size chart and the fur had some funky creases in it that I wasn't sure would smooth out.It already had pre-punched holes, and no hole puncher was included.No wonder the price was too good to be true, nsidering a good leather belt can be easily or moreThis is a nice graphic tshirt, the part BEAST" and drawing are very well printed.I bought recently a T-shirt for which has a better building quality than this one.If only they have imported a better tissue, this uld've been a nice shirtMaterial is some kind of felt.I am giving them two stars only because of how soft they seem.-most importantly, doesn't look like the pictures see the pictures to understand So, I remmend buying from the other link that i inserted ,I would stick with a good quality metal or stainless.Love the graphics but the material is not as pictured, it's very wispy and tears easilyNice quality and very cute zip case.It looks great when it mes, but the material rubs off from being in a pocket.Cute and warm though.These gloves are thick, mfortable and warm.I have bought many leggings these are smaller than I expected and not nearly as streatchy as others I have bought because of that they re hard to put on and the fabric is not very breathableThe price was excellent but quality wasn't very good.No defined features it's all flat.The lor and fabric are nice though, if only they fit true to size.It's itchy and the edges are sharpThe top fit great, looked good on me, and was stretchy and mfortable, but I uldn't even get the bottoms up past my hips; it wasn't stretchy at all.Everything seemed normal except for the length.It did not me put together so I had to figure out how to lace it up properlyNOT REAL STAINLESS STEELOtherwise looks okay.The pants are of decent quality and overall more fashionable than rugged.Tank top is small and rides up during a work out.The material was very hard to withstand and the top didn't fit right at all.The snowman detail isn't that great for the price.- Not very reflective.The seller gives the impression that the tops you will receive will be Belle Donne" brand but there is no such thing.It's a better value and you will actually get the tops that you see on the website so there won't be any surprisesThe shoes are really cute.She loves Frozen.They look great in the picture but they don't stay in place.Would look better without all the metal that makes up necklace.I wanted to love this but the fit is a bit to loose doesn't bring much support to you incision.I love the rug but I wouldn't buy it again.The zipper is heavy duty, but plastic, which makes sense for use in the water.It was inexpensive so no big deal, but I wouldn't remmended.The badge attached to his shirt, and almost weighs down the tton it might be better to wear this badge with a more solid, stronger shirt or vest).It is also not as nicely made as the one in the picture.Not very good quality but it's a hat.It is not loose and flowy at allI wear .R in several styles of older military Belleville boots made in the USA and love them.I'm simply going to give the to the local thrift store and stay with the USA made ones.The good news is they are very light and have a good lace system.They are mfortable/breathable, not as baggy as a lot of people made them sound.They slide down too much for my liking.Seeing as I'm no longer years old I wasn't a fan.Photo is more flattering than it looks in personMy issue is the hardware.I wasn't happy with the style and quality of this product.It looked like the perfect swimsuit to hide those flaws, especially the tummy area.To me, it was one of those that looks better on the hanger, then on the body.Other than that the quality was good especially for the price.This belly ring is flexible and mfortable.Very cheap... Beautiful rings, but three ring have broken and I only had the chance to wear each once.Its cute but the sizechart you have didn't work for me.The arch support is too light.It was a great belt for months.Would remmend buying something a little more expensive and sturdy.This swing top was not heathered as pictured, but I overlooked that, and kept it.It is a Metal stamping.If you really needed a wallet and only had dollars probably a good purchase.I feel these glasses are over priced.This dress is not very well made stitching had to be repaired in several places.The dress is cute, but not well made.With that said, the fabric on the top is so soft.This necklace took well over weeks to get.Material was very soft and thin good for summer, will be keeping product.Did not like the netting on insideNot made goodVery sheer, wrinkles easily, cut very smallOtherwise the leather material and soles were nice and customer service was very acmmodating and easy to work with.Comfortable, sop neck too bigThe fabric itself is very lovely but a bit sheer, so bear that in mind.The applique is not attached all the firmly, but given the item's low price, I wasn't particularly fussed; you get what you pay for and my expectations weren't all that high.Not top grade quality, but would have made a smart layered look piece but for that feature.I'm ', , and the jacket LOOKED good, but no way uld I wear a sweater underneath.When I saw the magnet nnection, I thought it would work well and be equally quirky.It's not very well made.The quality of this skirt was fine, but the description online is off.It tore easily when I was holding a dog at my job vet tech) and his nail went right through it.I liked the top though.Really cute, really soft long length leggings.No quality at all.I am not a fan of Patty Boutik stuff, too synthetic...So unless you have a straight figure, it doesn't give" around your curves as you put it on something king of important with a one-piece that you have to slide up over your hips.Until the buckle breaks, the belts look brand-new.Looks so much better in pictures provided.The quality is not what I expected.Maybe for someone with ol skin tones and who likes to rock baby pastels(?)Needs a sturdier brimFor the price you would expect a much longer use.Zipper broke after less than weeks of use.Material seems nice as well but the sleeves are very wingy"You can tell it's made for the Asian market so if your child is petite then this might be great for you.Boden has great sales, so if you time their sales then you can buy their product for a very mparable price. stars for the awesome design and shirt material quality.The cap is a very attractive cap and just what I was looking for.The clock is non-functioning...it's just pieces you put together to use to teach time.I was expecting a sweater, but this is a very thin and not woven material.Charm is nice but chain must be for a newborn.Some of the beads were quite loose on two of the rings, but the other two were okay.Safe to say they were only in my nipples for a uple of weeks until I found prettier ones.The quality is wool.Its thick, but I wouldn't call it soft.The fabric is OK.It sits in my bedroom unused and the st of sending it back is not worth it.Material feels wonderful.It was super soft thoughI liked the blouse and would have loved to wear it back when I was years oldI can only speak about the Style- Black bikini.It's good quality material BUTNot mfortable for a baby a baby at all.Our month old wiggles a lot and easily escaped this.The material is nice for eczema kids thoughAgain, maybe someone taller would be ok, but then the dress might be too short.The fabric feels incredible and I was excited when I pulled it out of the package.The stitching and zipper were very nice.Is not too warm.If you want to play around with this particular look at a super cheap price point, though, it's worth at least giving a shot.This product is not original.Not the material shown in the picture.Style is great, material wrinkles easy and is paper thin.No lining or any embelishments.these are ol except they were shipped bent up.The fabric is very casual tton.I will keep it because I wore it, and I will see if it works better for summer...This shirt was a disappointment, and it was too late for me to return and purchase another, better shirt.I bought it because I loved the simplicity.I have old Wigwam crew socks that I love and I wish they still made them like they used to.Bought it a uple of months ago and haven't worn it yet.Gave it a since the fabric quality is ok.Looked better on the picturethe dress is beautiful not see-through.i have a beside-the-point thing to say which i will not elaborate on the packaging is unusual, functional beautiful.The dress does look like the picture...it arrived much quicker than expected and does appear to be sewn well.If you have any curves, its not for you.The positives: Opening these in the package, I was thrilled by how soft they were.Super, pleasantly soft and mfy to put on.I am super sad because I really loved these pretties out of the package and would have worn them a lotFirst of all, this dress is not linen.However, reviews stating the dress of of high quality are misrepresentations or not accustom to quality made garments.Collects dust my daughter is months and the slippers fit big, but I expected that based on the other reviews.Its nice when you first get it, but after about days, the lock on the back had broken and a few days following the chain had broke, but the chain was fix able, and the lock still makes it useable.These were extremely unmfortable to wear as the round" ends almost all had very rough edges that do not feel good in, on, or around your nose.It looks beautiful, flattering, and long in the picture.I bought these mittens for my month old son so he uld play in the snow.The material is heavier than expected but very soft to the feel.I had purchased these for my elderly mother.I thought they would have an elastic edge which would allow easier and softer handling.This skirt is totally see through and not at all the type of material I was expecting.Overall, my dissatisfaction is my fault for forgetting to check the reviews.It does look great.It doesn't have the nice rounded look as shown in the picture.Not smooth like in the picture.Shirt was very heavy and not soft.the quality was not as good as it looked in the picture.Did not like feel of material.I liked the material and design but actually it is too much larger than expected . Maybe it is the Quicksilver standard model .Other then that the blouse is beautiful.I should have bought the more expensive one.Cheaper than it looks and not worth the price.Nevertheless it is probably the best necklace this far for the shine .I'm not shure the shine supports being worn as a necklace yet and it may not be accurate in this fashion.This dress is very pretty in the image.The fabric is not stretchy.It isn't very attractive from the front.It's nice for the price, but not for me.I don't mind paying for a plastic boned rset, if that's what I was expecting to buy, but this was advertised as steel and it is notNice dress and well made.Yet, this one has a lower quality feel to it, and the back light is not as effective to read.looks very cheap, but good for kids, the lor is good thoughPROS: The fabric was really soft and mfortable.- It was well made.- Love the pockets.I bought this to help transition from regular clothes to maternity clothes.I understand that it needs to be tight enough to keep pants from falling down, but it was hard for me to wear.Soles sturdy.Don't think it will be good for intended purpose--daily use as pool/shower shoe.If you are carrying higher I feel like the product would be fine.The satin material feels nice, but it doesn't breathe.It fit her fine for the picture, but is most definitely not the high quality" the description says it is.On a better note, the material is great quality and it is very cute.The dress was too long and the material was not as expected.The height of the t is not adjustable so many of my shirts and dresses you uld see the bra.Otherwise I liked the bra.Love the texture, so smooth.Material is warm.The fabric material is soft and nice.Very small cut but nice finish.You have to have a perfect figure to pull this dress off.The material is soft, and it's very mfortable.This bag looks very nice, I was looking for a pretty wine lored bag.These were mfortable and I liked them initially.I expected better quality from Hanes.Other than that quality and print was great.love the lace and the idea of this dress.So my only advice would be if you happen to be on the shorter side just watch the prints.This product clearly says waterproof".My daughter needs a waterproof at.It's very pretty and seems to be made of moderate quality materials.The lining is a silky/polyester type blend.They're super cute and easy to throw on anywhere and I loved them while they lasted, but I will not be purchasing from this seller again.Another thing that I DID like was that they were super warm because of the lining insideThe material was pretty itchy and not at all mfortable.You would need to definitely wear something under it to make it more mfortable.lint/static friendly.The product isn't made very well either as I put a hole in the tip of one of the shoes and I never left the side walk, parking lot or mansion.However, the material is very nice, very soft and smooth and ol feeling and the lors were nice vivid.Not a flattering cut.The only thing I disliked about these is the star is not a stone it's painted and looks cheap other then that the moon and ready is fine.Shape is fine.And, the material is scratchy.Cute but is only as thick as a shirt.Not happy with quality.The attached heart chain fell off while my daughter was wearing it and is lost so because of that, I don't believe I can return it since part of it is missing.I loved the ncept of this bag.The satin pleating is gorgeous.They fall down and slide all over the watch.I returned this strap because it wasn't of good quality.Initial fit was ok, but the fabric had no real body.By evening I uld use it as a night shirt.Nice but they don't stretch at all really.The material is super thick, which is nice but I think it's the reason it hangs kind of funny.I received a dress early today to my pleasant surprise, but to my dismay was not what I chose; I wanted the sweetheart type top, as in the pictures in the preview and other purchasers' photos.The lor and pattern is fine, and the materials seem decent...nice and flowy, light, well lined.The inside of the straps is a plastic material and not mfortable.High quality and the magnet is strong too.Everything was great about these except the stitching isn't strong on the inside medical grade siline" panel.I will say the quality is great, thick and nice matte not shiny at all.Fine but much pretty in the pictureIt has the best nfiguration of places to put things extremely well designed in that manner.It is also not soft to the touch.Also the strap is too wide and the way it is attached with the rectangular metal bracket allows the strap to move and then it gets bunched would be much better if they used a round ring.Definitely not the same length as the picture.It gives very firm stretch that would shape you nicely without strangling you...except it won't stay at all.I sew so I plan to sew in some boning where ever there are seams to give it some stay up support.It will probably make a great shaper to workout in because it can give good support while letting you breathe.The straps are admittedly of good quality and given more generous webbing I'd likely be writing a glowing review.I have naturally thicker legs from dance and soccer and I thought they were going to be flattering but they are just bulky and the lace is heavy at the bottom.It's an awesome product.Not exactly what you want to smell from an item you're expecting to be new.Comfy jammies.She is ample but certainly not overly so.I would only remmend this dress for someone who is under ' and slender, maybe it would work.I've recently been looking for summer clothing and need to keep vered better.Quality is good and as advertised, shame I didn't get the full order.It's beautiful but he will need a ring guard.I love the first picture of that thick fabric warm zy sweater don't know where the modle got that one from....Looks really ol but already broke.This product needs to have better sizing charts.The curls are far from being that perfects and precise but it works for a clown wig.It's a beautiful dress.Not a flattering fit.Disappointed and returning this.. Also the seam in the neck had fuzzy string popping out of the seam not well made.has reflection on the inside of the lenses causing sight problems in direct sun light.It'll work, I guess, but the stume pieces I got for me look much better.Material is very mfortable although not a fan of the pouch.This was a prime item and it took two weeks to get here.Cute but not for sensitive skin.I was expecting shoes that light up and these definitely don'tQuality seems okay but they're not everything as advertised.I love the length of it.also fabric is silky, picture really makes it seem like it might be more tton blend, especially if you review the picture of the model.Overall good buy but not for the price.I would really prefer the authentic stones for the price.In fact, there is no wire at all... not sure who wrote the description why they think the super thin foam is what makes a pushup but it uldn't be further from that.The overall design is very beautiful though I'll admit that customer service gave me a full refund asap but I would rather have a bathing suit that fits.they ride pretty tight in the crotch and the seams are really bulky and intrusive, on the upside they do keep you're junk in place, but you can find better boxers that do that.Stty craftsmanship.I bought a set of these a few months ago and was pleased that they lasted months.If I had to do over, I'd see if they uld be reinforced from the beginning.They are nice other than that, it will just be a while before I can use them.I dnt think the quality of the briefs are good for the price that I paid.This necklace is adorable.The first two spots were fixable with some pliers.The actual trinket is adorable and seems durable.This Tie Bar looks great, but the back doesn't reach far enough to not shift if you move when you wear it, as it doesn't clip to enough of the shirtsFront of dress from waist to floor is very see-thru.It doesn't look that great in real.But I uld see how someone with a smaller band size and who would trade flattering their breasts for a potentially more mfortable bra) might be happy with these.I was looking for a sleep bra or a stretchy day bra and these just didn't work for me.Two stars because the quality was okay even if I can't wear it, very lorful.These pins claim to be stainless and high quality, and a bargain for the meticulous individual.Don't trust these pins.It is way over priced for the quality and workmanship.not swimsuit material at all.The straps are much more sturdy and thick in the picture.Good quality.Wasn't the right material.Cute design but maybe better for a child the adult.I am '" and muscular.Although I am not very tall about ' so if someone tall ordered this it may look better on them.I bought this item for my wife.What the....if this accessory is optional" that point should be evident before purchasing the product.The display clearly demonstrates the model with the top, skirt, and STOCKINGSPretty beach dress.Liked the material.It was cute otherwise and seemingly good quality, so I gave it stars.Was not tton but more of a silky material It was mpletely see through.As expected for the st.These look good, but wash them before wearing.Not quite stretchy enough.i didn`t like the material.It is nice for the price, earrings are a little too heavy.Product is good quality and lors are nice, but size is not rrect.It doesn't seem like leather to me, certainly not of any quality.The ink faded/wore off after less than a week of useNice looking though.Quality of the bracelet isn't good.I'm ' lb, not really slim, but I have a lot of extra room in this shirt.Material is ok, light weight I prefer heavier fabric).It would have been star because it looked great until it was washed.Not good quality but I guess okay for the price.They aren't mfortable like palazzo pants should be.I did not realize that there was small sparkly stones on this top.Beautiful at.Not at all waterproof, soaks right through.These are not cashmereThe shoes had great grip.Completely sheerItem was was as described but wasn't happy with it didn't seem to work very well maybe needed something more like thick leather or like material which I believe this seller has also.It did not meet my expectations at all because of the magnetic closure of the bracelet it falls off very easily I lost it twice but thankfully I found it but I don't wear it all because of that.Zippers didn't stand up during a day trip to the Bahamas, problem was solved with a pair of pliers when I got home.The cubes held a lot of clothes and the soft sides made them easy to maneuverSuch a beautiful necklace for the price.Nice top and material but not true to size.This band was useful for the - weeks while I was waiting for my maternity pants to arrive around week of my pregnancy).I felt much more mfortable mentally and physically) once I made the switch.Your will likely need them eventually, so you might as well buy early and get some good use out them.There's not enough threads on the back of the earring to keep the ball tightly secured.Ring is pretty but the black finish was already halfway worn off by the time it arrived.Not worth the st I might have kept it if it were a less expensive piece.Dress is ok but the hand design is not good.Great ncept, but didn't work for my year old's shoes.Leather smell is so strong it fills up the room, maybe it is sprayed with leather scent.Great material but SUPER TIGHTWas also much longer than I needed I'm ') rock lor though.the material is fabulousBeautiful dress with intricate designs just not made to actually fit.Just an okay product I'll never wear and I regret buying.The top part of the dress is a bit sheer, but would probably be okay with a nude-lored bra.Would probably look really good on a taller frameI paid more for the other and the chains are of greater quality.The quality of the locket earned the stars, because to be fair it was well made.The lors were great and the fabric was super soft and zy, but definitely not large enough for most women.This product says tton slim fit but the material has more of a spandex fit/feel than a tton fit/feel.Material not to my likingNot fully sewn.I liked that the fur was removable.There's enough room for the twig or the berries, but not both.Not durable elastic what so ever.I had to go out to buy new wire in order to put the beads to use.The quality is low but that is to be expected for this price.It will get the job done and you can invest in higher quality plugs after you are done stretching.Looks great on model.Non flexible makes it less mfortable.I love the designs though.They are as clear as in the photos.These pants are not designed for a woman with hips or a booty.Material and lor looks great.The quality of the product is as I expected for the price I paid.Otherwise very loose.quality not wat expected, in my untry I would find much betterNice decal design, but the fabric quality is not very good, it had a big white spot on bottom of shirt that uld not be removed by washing it.While the fabric IS real thin, this would be okay during the warm months.Absolutely no support in the bust.With a little bit of creativity, you can make a better kit yourself for about the same price or a bit more, but be proud of it and not cut a rner.The quality was okay for the price, the sequin definitely would have me off within a uple of washes, though.Definitely for show rather than utility.The hoodie feels warm, but I haven't had a chance to wear it on a windy day so I don't know how well it will protect against that.I have hoodies less than half that st which are mperable or even better.They do not look good.The style for this is classic and I would have loved to have added it to my wardrobe.I typically buy this shoe and this time the mesh already has a hole in it.One was pale with a flat surface.I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS ITEM; COULDN'T WAIT TO WEAR IT.Since this is my first case I have learned from others it was a case for design not for protection, It does not have protection around the rners to help w/ impact in case it gets dropped.I bought this dress because I'm months prego and needed some bigger dresses.Quality is fine.There was no lining in the top, which I uld have lived with I was on vacation who caresThe straps felt too wide in the front, and the cut is not soped enough under the arms to be mfortable.Definitely can't be used as a pick, so I have no idea why they shaped it like one.Slides all over during the day.quality is not great.Nice and thick but very very flowy in the front.Completely flat inside.Looks great though and a decent quality.Great belt, exactly what I was looking for.Not awful material but they uld use something better.Other than that the fabric was a decent quality, especially for the price.This cropped shirt is potentially awesome but the cropped part mes just below my chest.The material though is soft and it is well nstructed in my opinion.I love Vionic/Orthaheel shoes and these are very nice but I can not believe these are described as WHITEDid not meet expectations, made poorly and no thigh highs were included.Looks great and most of the time works great.I just glued it in-place and will see if that helps it.UPDATE Yes, Super-Glue worked great to keep the loop in place holding the band.Actual shirt is not as attractiveNot real gems..just painted metal.Shirt is nice, but made in China.Not impressed with size, quality or lorThese are nice looking glasses that fit well and are reasonably high quality.Having received the send pair, I am sure that this is a permanent issue.The stitching is adequate, but i don't think will hold few laundry rounds.I like the llar and button detail.The laid back surfer look can be achieved, provided one gets rrect size.I thought it was sewed to this style but its not.Fits as expected but was NOT the material I expected or the shade of pink I was expecting...very bright pinkThere is a sheer overlay over the original dress that makes it feel a little too dressy for a casual" summer dress.Very cute top.Great quality product except mine was missing a diamond when I received it...Otherwise the rings are sturdy looking.Very beautiful, nice material, doesn't fit as stated.Well, these are not translucent.Mind you, My piercing is in my nose.Not smooth.Did not like the materialThe picture made me think it was rose gold, when in reality it is silverIt's not soft.These are absolutely beautiful and I wish I uld wear them.I'm currently trying to stretch the shoes out since the leather is soft.It smells like a loose woman who hasn't showered in months.Faux leather is always a gamble, but based on reviews I decided it was too good to pass up as it met my aesthetic desires and needs.Not mfortable to wear.Looks great at first.Very hard to wear and I have only tried to wear once but ended up ming home to change because it just doesn't sit right on the body.Needed to have it altered.I think if the top had fit rrectly to my frame and if I spent a moment really fiddling with them, they uld look great, but it simply won't work for me.Love the lors and quality of this purse, but ours came with the cloth separation from the trim which was not acceptable.Great quality.More importantly, the lens are not uniform which makes it blurry in a specific spot and creates a ripple in your view if you move your head.Spend more to get better glasses.material is not that great and it doesn't look as it's pictured on the modelPictures: the black pearl was mine that I had put in there to show how it holds the pearl.IMO if you wear around a DDD DD and a torso range of -; I think this dress would be a dream me true.It is spacious and does have a nice lengthy shoulder strap which was what I needed.Does it have stars under the brim?Yes, but for that price do yourself a favor and get something of higher quality.Otherwise, I was happy to see that the watch seemed to be of decent quality.I had to let it air out outside for two and a half day before the smell went away.Not great quality nsidering the price.This is an absolutely beautiful dress.strangely long legs, not mfortableI thought I would get a gold or brass looking bracelet like he picture.I don't care for silver.The lor, texture and fabric is as described and I like those aspects very much, but the sizing is quite off.The pattern is beautiful but the purse is heavy, the handles have too many clunky chains and makes a lot of noise.Set out when received had to glue.But still warm.Acrding to the seller's return policy, once they're out of the bag, their % guarantee" is out the window.Obviously not pleased at all with the quality.It will eventually fit my daughter I am sure but not for the family photo session I speciffically bought this for when she is month old.The quality of this hoodie is actually pretty good, but my mplaint is the sizing, I ordered a S, my usual size.I sleep in XL tshirts be mfortable.The material isn't great either.not too mfortable.I don't see this being mfortable on girls with big boobs.The bracelet is pretty, but I would expect it to hold up better than that.I have repaired it with glue and hopefully it will hold.cheep materialI've had it for over a year now and it's held up really well- definitely a well made product with quality material and workmanship.I've washed it a bunch- way more than normal, and pleasantly surprised that it's help up so well and still looks so good.The only downside for me was the lor was a bit more vibrant than expected, which is why I left off two stars, but make no mistake- this is a really good quality product.Cute shirt but not made well at allAll the designs were very unique and cute.The price isn't a problem but that is definetly an integrity issue.The fabric is pretty and the quality is ok, there is just no way I can wear it.The earrings can be sold cheaper than I've paid for.Too thick wish they were not do denseSee through topIt's stylish, functional and easy to use.I bought this jacket for a relative, I was very upset about the quality of the jacket.Heels hanging out.The quality is ok but the sandals look better in the picture.not beach appropriate but still able to use elsewhereGood product for the price, what i expected in quality.Thought these would look and feel different.Too girlish for me.The top lace is fun though.I will say the shirt appeared well made.Does not lubricate well.The material being sturdy and stretchable as it is really does flatten your stomach.I needed a dress for my baby shower and seen this was very cute and looked mfortable.When I received the dress it was indeed mfortable but the fabric was too thin to wear to the party.If it was made with a slightly thicker fabric it would have been perfect.You can see through it in white) which I'm fine with for a ver up but wouldn't use this as a dress.The other two straps are hanging by threads and will me off after further use as well.Material MUCH different than expected, cheaper lookingReturned and bought a cheap pair of knit ones instead and these work fine for this year.These are cheap knock-offs Spend the money for the original and you'll be happier.Beautiful dress but make sure it's what you want.For health reason the dress does not work Costume jewelry onlyThe material is not named and it does not breathe very well.More importantly the pockets are fake and I needed a blazer with pockets.Originally, when I received this product in the maiI was satisfied with the quality.It's a nice top.Every body bump, muffin top and bra fat will be enhanced in this dress.The dress does not work for me.They felt soft, so I really wish they would have sent the rrect ones.I'm , Lb and love the flow of the shirtI can no longer wear itThe chest area does not support anythingThe box is nicely made and solid with a rich look to it.It's a beautiful necklace.They Material is very stretchy.I wear a woman's - so I thought getting the - would be exactly what I needed.It's a very soft material and is pretty large.Unfortunately, the clasp broke days after I got it.Back to square one looking for a wedding dressDefinitely a good fair quality dress if you're not looking for a wedding dress, but order a size or up )The hair tie fits on the bracelet, but will not stay on.The grooves are not deep enough for the hair tie to stay in place.The bracelets are cute and can be worn without the hair tie.Soft material.I have much cheaper sunglasses that are way better.There is no room for breastsThe quality of the product is very good; however, the red lor pictured in the choices is not what I received.I found these did NOT lock on post nor heard/felt it click" in place.not mfy at all, weird fitThe leather is nice.The suit was torn when I received it,so I had to just hold it up to my body it looked as if I we're to put it on it would be a swimsuitIt looks nice, feels super soft and I can stretch in it.However, it slides down when I stand up or walk so I can't use them for dancing.I washed it twice, but i uld still smell it faintly.The fabric is of a nice weight, soft, and a pretty baby blue.All stitching is done in white thread, which I don't think looks too good either.The socks are great, but the non slip bubbles on the bottoms are NOT.Not as good of a quality that I had hoped for.They look good.The quality seems good, but the sizing is a little off.There is simply a flat panel where the girls belong but no pocket' for them to rest in.So this is basically a smock type nightgown with no flattery or sexiness at all.Nice bag, just a little too floppy for my taste.In my opinion its only good for clothing.It's a good quality for the price however if you have curve I absolutely do not at all remmend.This bra gets two stars because at least it's beautiful.This is sturdy, well made and it does stretch shoes.What I really needed was a device that allowed me to stretch whatever dimension I needed, with a last technical term) shaped like my own anatomy, or enough adjustments so I uld make the device do what I needed.Beautiful but lousy material.I have a pretty athletic body with curves at my lower half.Felt stuffed in it.The shirt is nice and exactly what it looks like in the picture.It was every sock in the same place which leads me to believe it's a manufacturing issue.I'll update again if the new socks are of better quality.I have some of the two tone Vero Monte socks and those are very well made.Wishing they fit right they looked great on the family in the photo.The material was ok but I ended giving it up to my friendFabric is stretchy, almost stumy, no lining, donated it.Would look great on someone who is very tall and skinny but that's about it.Please note the difference in the material quality and texture and also the difference in size.Not sure it printed rrectly.Not real impressed with the quality.The backstrap stretched out so the flip flops wouldn't stay on my daughter's feet.Loved the style, however it is not durable.style did not look good on meDress is very see through.But super cute and mfy just need to buy a slip to go under nowOkay, I liked this necklace fine.Look nice so they do not get a -star but the product was a let down from what I was expecting.Pricey thought they would be nicer especially since I had to purchase them separately to get handles.Cap was not of the quality I expected.I love this belt.Its mfy and it keeps my pants up.Great product The ats thick and warm.the top cream part is see-through.She says they are very mfortable.Straps a little big but fix her great everywhere else.Good quality but wayyy too small for my daughter to wear for skiing.I still gave it two stars because the socks them self are warm.doesn't really look like the pic but still cute and got the job done, definitely underwear made just to be taken off.material is rough and scratchy so not something you wanna wear under a dress all date night long.Not as nice as it looks in the picture.So this is great for one time use, just not if you plan to wear it longer.Coating was a bit abrasive for my tastes.Didn't feel like something I was mfortable inserting into my body.But, overall its okay looking.I ordered the Gold Metallic VonVonni Women's Transformer Dress, not the gold with the animal print, just the regular one.There's nothing shimmery gold or gold metallic about the dress I received.Although I've only had negative things to say about the dress I received, I can honestly say that the actually fabric felt nice had good weight to it, jersey-like material) and was decent for the price they charge.Wished that this dress was in the right gold metallic lor and better crafted, I uld have saved money, however I'll look elsewhere and spend more for quality.Reguarding the texture and quality of the tights, I would buy more than one pair but the sizing for me is very offNot a good material.Quality of material is not that greatI was expecting real animal leather per item description, and I would feel mfortable wagering that this is not.It has a synthetic smell and the graining texture is too uniform.Bottom line: If you buy this expecting synthetic leather and mall boutique quality for fashion forward styling, you'll be happy.If you buy expecting true leather and craftsmanship, you'll want to search for something else.Its a peach.The lining under the lace is a very pool quality fabric is kind of shiny doesn't match the lace so it is very noticeable when wearing this garment.I might wear around the house but that's as far as it's going to go..disappointed.It's definitely not made for a real woman's figure Good enough for the night, chain broke as i tried to put it on, lucky for me, it broke close to the end so i uld still make it work.Still looks very good but it won't last long.if you are built like i am, its probably not a good choice for you.I finally immersed one in boiling water for sends, and found it pliable enough to work with.The product looked in great ndition.Material is good, the lor was perfect but it does not fit the way I wanted too.The lace is too long and the opening was not long enough.Not made wellThe fabric is not linen.It is a very sheer gauzy type.Cute product, great idea but obviously not made for a woman with a shape.Fabric isn't the best quality, but only the texture reflects that.These dresses must be made by the Munchkin women with eating disorders society.Looks and feels like a pajama topThe sewing is not great on this.did not work with my bodyLooks great but not right for interval training/cross training activities.Even w the adjustable drawstring this still did not stay on my sons headjust doesn't have the quality I was looking for.I purchased it for use at work; so, it'll work'Again, the bag is great, but not happy with the purchase.They also aren't well made.The llar trim is not as wide and fluffy as seen.Quality of the fabric is not good cut is okBut quality of material is good enough.want to like this piece very much as it is extremely delicate and beautiful.The quality and deign however was very good and that is the only reason that it didn't not receive only one star.Nice fit, light material.It does cut down the glare but it also hides your headlights...not good for night driving....ok for dayMore of a navy/forest grew.Beautiful material and design.. but runs a little narrow.Especially for linen.Soft nice material.Material not goodIt's cute but I am not really happy with this top.Don't like the fabric.This at is form fitting.It's heavy and seems to have nice quality but you can't wear a sweatshirt or sweater under it.Not what I expected and I didn't care for the material.It's very delicate.I didn't expect them to wear like iron, but, on the other hand, I did expect to be able wear them at least once.Pretty mfortable.If you do not have a serious flat tummy and a banging bod....this outfit is not for you.The items were not as expectedI don't know what good this pants is for but for winter it will not be good at all material too thin.It looks great at first, but after weeks wearing, it shows tons of scratches.Not very sturdy but it's nice looking.Boxy, short torso, masculine shaped t-shirt.NOT premium feel or look.%Cotton, so it will shrink some, but still plenty of room.Didn't use yet as it is mplicated to put on.It is very warm and light.The material and lor were exactly what I ordered.The material is pretty thin, it doesn't fit all that great, and if I tried this on in the store, I would have not purchased it.Very cute, but not mfortable.On the bright side, I really liked the feel of the fabric and felt they were nstructed really well.I will be returning these for something made of higher quality and more expensive.Good styling.Picture is nicer than cardigan.Material wasn't what I expected.However it folds so easy and crinkles.I got the bamboo one and it is so soft and smooth and MUCH more mfortable to wear.Lining too thickThe pictured dress is much brighter than the actual received item.Beautiful sandals.Not happy with the qualityThis box has fake leather that does feel nice but nsidering my hinge issue, i don't think i can travel with it in multiple trips with out something happening to it.The cut is a-line and flattering.The top of this suit is better suited for a A or B cup, my boobs were spilling out of it everywhere definitely not suitable for a D cup at all.I received no chain and only one tiny jump ring for the other side of the pendant.Bought black and a years back, was very pleased with both pants.I'm not sure which part of the ear these are made for, but the place that the heart separates is in the wrong spot.It needs to be closer to the top of the heart so that you can see that it's a heart when you wear it.NO vertical boning prevents it from being held up properly and it creates rolls on my otherwise slim bodyVrry sturdy.Loved the material, but if your looking for a baggy mfy shirt like the photos do not buy thisI bought this with the hope to wear under some dresses but there is a TON of material on these shorts - not sure who the fit model is, but definitely not good for anyone under '''.So far it has stained everything it touches, including my hands.It looks good in the picture.The bead doesn't hold a glow for more than a minute and the finish started to rub off after a week.My wife loved this purse.I love the drape.I love that it is lined.I love how the fabric feels.It's a very cute umbrella, but was bent with in a day of normal use.These shoes are too cute.it was not symmetrical or cut properly.Already purchased a different band with a buckle so I know it will stay together.The chain broke within a cpuple minutes and I was a B when I ordered this and the top just didn't look good on me.I expected better qualityLooks like it spent a year bleaching in the sun and might now pass for the lightest, most translucent shade of mint.- Material is okay, I can totally see myself wearing this during spring/summer hood strings are very low quality.The romper was definitely soft and felt warm but it looked like a bunny stume with teeth instead of stitch.I love the design of the purse but the quality sucks.They were too big and the design was not attractive.Doesn't look great.This is not secure pills fall out easily- the clasp needs to be more secureThe bikini is cute, and I really like the model, which is mfortable.I hope the smell washes out.Cute for a kid and sized for a kid, but not real jewelry at all.The ring was very nice at first, but after wearing just a short period it broke.Two major issues: ) The fleece inside isn't sewn in very well, so, it takes a few sends to get all your fingers in rrectly and I don't have very big hands).These gloves are definitely warm, but, if there's any moisture from sweat or snow, etc.Cool shoes although one of the lights sometimes works and that one light is a different lor when the rest are all the same.Very mfortable if you plan on wearing around the house or under another tank in public.So I thought this would be the same or very similar, but it's a cheap knockoff.Additionally, they aren't nearly as soft or silky.So the quality ntrol is absent as well.Fabric is too clingy nstantly had static cling but the lor was very nice and brightTurned my neck green in days.Fabric and design seemed nice but would have expected the skirt to fan out more, not be so form fitting.Only giving this two stars bc my daughter loves them despite the flaw.Unmfortable and do not see same pain relieving effects as I did with other pper braceletsthe material is very thin something to be worn in the summer would be perfect for.Sweater is cuteonly the stones on the flower are clear and shining, rest are turbid and dull.Also the stones on the leaves are not put in properly.The sleeves and pocket are helpful, but the velcro is very weak and my son can pull it off quicker then I am able to put it on him.The quality of the badges itself are good however.Just did not look good on me.I loved the suit and would have altered it is possible but there was no way to alter the bust without tearing it apart mpletely.urse tton material, not soft.Saw the exact ones at the dollar store so that will give you an idea of the quality.Oh well, I just wanted some on hand for people who missed the memo that it's a masquerade party and I guess these were affordable and better than nothing.I feel it was a waist of my time and money and I had nothing to replace it with and had to wear my stud to the interview..They look ol and would look a lot oler if the screw head fit perfectly against my ear.Not easy to use.I would have preferred to get something more expensive that was higher quality.The straps slide so easily, it is not usable unless you tie the excess slack.Nice hat but all creased upIt is very soft and would be mfortable, if it fit.These are better material then the fruit of a loom but run small uld be softer tton.These are beautiful on the photo, but do not fit as expected on arrival.This item is more of a muscle T rather then a racer back tank top.The material wasn't long enough for a woman '.The were mfortable and felt perfect she said but when she bent over the waist slid down like a plumbers butt.Quality seems good and the designs are nice but just aren't true to size.They left a note in the package that there was residue' from the curing process, which there was.This is not very well made at all.not really pleased with this itemThe price is inexpensive, certainly.But is well made and good material and arrived in days as expected.They worked fine--I still wear them regularly.THE LEATHER TIP ON THE BELT IS NOT PROPERLY SEWN AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO THREAD THRU PANT BELT LOOPS.This dress appears to be nicely made for the price and the fabric is soft and lightweight.I know that is how it looks on the model, and what other taller reviews reported, but given my short height and the claim that it is " long, I ordered it.It ties very nicely around my body.The material is super shiny.There's a lot of material so be careful if wearing for an outdoor wedding on a hot summer day.It's a beautiful style.Whoever heard of a sweatshirt that needs to be hand washed and dried flatCould be used as a tapestry I guess...Wish it was ttonsStill ol, but not what is advertisedLovely ring.I highly doubt this is leather.Maybe the very back of the belt is leather not clear through.Clearly I didn't know what I was buying and clearly need to buy an expensive quality belt next time.Now I know what synthetic leather is.too expensive for the quality.Wasn't mfy.The previous pairs I owned were great, in fit and quality.No real body to this one...felt like I was putting on a sheet.Quality wise it was fine I would have kept it if the fit was betterI really appreciated the mpanys ability to mpensate me for the loss and would remmend clothing that is not snug dependent ie swimwear).stume jewelry, but feels a little cheaper than expected for the price.Runs a bit small but feels nice and is made with good quality material.I used to have a pair of jeggings that were so soft and so mfortable but still uld be worn like pants.They were mfortable too.Perhaps if I had hand washed, hang dried, and ironed it would have been ok but honestly, I'm just not that kind of girl.If it's not easy to wash and wear, I can't be bothered.Easier to put on than I expected, but isn't that durable and it was only used once.This was too light weight of material for me.And I don't like the material.I hoped It would be more form fitting like the picture but it is not.not mfortableI don't know the way it's made I uldn't see wearing it to a class ever.The material is super soft though and that on it's own is a HUGE plus.The material keeps riding up the hips.The gems are pretty though.For clear and unobtrusive, it just doesn't work.They are clear but they're quite obvious.I looked at a lot of these phone cases because some of them had a kiss mark and a high heel on them and I didn't like that.Not stylish at allIt sits very loose.Also, was not happy with the quality of the material for .I've paid under for other tunics and have been pleased with the material.I remmend A&D for quality.Nice thick material thoughgood idea on design, but really doesn't work well.the pouch or flap should be able to hold it' in without popping out when not desired.the clasp is not strong enoughLoved the look but HATED the care instructions.I stay in shape so this is definitely a manufacturing flaw.There is a lot of fabric left over in front that needs to be gathered together to make it fit right.The fabric is soft but too sheer.The length was too short to be work appropriate.But still a good price for the productSee through top.This dress must've been made for a child.Nice looking, but lacks quality.It was not very mfortable to wear.the material is definitely much less and not nearly as full and not as flowy as the pictures shows.Treated with flame retardants, this was not obvious from the description.I used super glue and crossing my fingers it stays in place.The image on the wallet is beautiful.It would be better if they tucked the raw edge of the fabric in or vered itZipper can get caught easy so zip it up slowly and carefully.These served their purpose and looked great...Otherwise it's a pretty wallet, seems decently made though not real leather.Jewels fall off easy ( but i still love it.The stume st me . and included free shipping.Shirt is great in lor and quality but, I ordered a small, which is my size.Boxy as everWide opening which isn't great for skinny kids.These are NOT real LOKAI braceletsvery nice for the priceBest part about it was the belt quality and style.Attire manufacturer needs to do better job with wrinklesLooks better in the pics here than it does on.Material does not have a nice feel - it's on the rough side.The image for this absolutely lends to higher expectations.While the price point was not high, I at least expected quality that you would receive from a big box store with mparable sts.It can be sewn so that it will stay attached, but after buying new I would expect better.Cute design but broke less than months of wear.It's great that it blocks out the RFID stuff but I personally didn't care for it.Top can be replaced if you can find an other.I modified it to work with a magnetic base I have so it works but I'm not the norm.Quality is not that great.Satin lining is baggy in some areas around neckline and shows.It was mfortable and seemed good quality.The belt and design was beautiful.It is not cute and flowy.Very soft.The bag is beautiful but the chain straps were not to my liking so.The fabric is excellent but the cut is small in the groin and had more of a woman's panty appearanceBut the material was thick, so it might be nice for layering during Autumn.Buttons well sewn on and straightforward, nice structure.Other mittens were not staying on her hands so I went for the expensive ones that were called Stay On" mittensThe material itself is better than I expected.I'd rather pay a little more for a better zipper.Will make good shower shoes not as cushioney as they look, no cushion at allThe wrap they give you in the hospital works much better.On top of that they don't smell too pleasant.I'm hoping to wash them so they may shrink and smell better.Material is not of the best quality, but for the price you can't expect much.With a little Accessories and some nice shoes she made it work.The fabric was nice and the design was great.It's a perfect lightweight pajama, or a summer evening ver-up.It won't keep a baby warm in anything lower than degrees because it's fairly lightweight.The fabric is nice, but the pattern is garish.Really not good quality...Granted, my little girl is hard on shoes and plays outside a lot, I would remmend that if you purchase these, it be for church or functions, not school or everyday wear.I wish they'd make it decently out of good material and just charge more for a good product.The quality is good nsidering what you pay for itThan creamBesides the sizing I thought the overall quality was good, especially for what you pay for.It was basically a lampshade, I was swimming in fabric.Not a great value for the price paid.They were bright and cheerful and plush and warm - perfect for the winter.The layout is nice.The purse itself is not as good of a quality as I thought it was going to be... and it's super big.It's a little too short, I have to depend on the extender in order to be able to wear it, which takes away from the beauty of it.I know this was very inexpensive and you get what you pay for.The beads were falling off as soon as I opened the package.material is scratchyThere is a defect in how the top layer was applied to the bottom layer, and it wasn't flat during that transaction so there is an air pocket in the middle that doesn't allow my mouse to slide over it well.Not the best cat ears or tail.I don't feel the picture represents the product well.The quality of the wig is great, but not for Len.I uld not style the needed spikes for Len nor was the ponytail appropriate.There's no way you can make a baby wear this in the hot sun.I already had a violet cardigan and didn't need another.The quality was not too great eitherLooks much better in picture than it really is.The workmanship was not up to ICU standards.But for some shoes that she won't be in for long they were worth it.Not made with very quality fabric or workmanship.length was shorter than expected thin materialI really love the design, but I would purchase this style from another manufacturer.------------- This product is just as I expected.I purchased these to wear under low-cut tops for an extra interesting layer.It's not very supportive but it would be perfect to wear to yoga class.and the lace on the chest doesn't lay down well.The quality is wonderful but the sizing is way offLOOKS beautiful and Stunning and you can feel everything align as if you are in ultimate power ) However, I ware mine about out of days on the average.The purse itself is great, love the room and different mpartments.Cute, but gives you a camel-toe in the front, feels like a wedgie up front too you gotta adjust it to make it mfortable.The fabric is thicker and the llar is a secure closure.I love the ombr look to these pants but I must have not read the material because I thought they were tton but they are not.Not very quality fabric.It looks nice but the crisscross straps in the back are difficult and it runs smalllots of metal.you see more metal than you do diamonds.i took it to my jeweler who nfirmed it was incredible value, definitely better than they uld give me.it just didn't sparkle like a diamond bracelet should.They are pretty post earrings.Was going to send them back but I make simple jewelry for fun had backs that fit many craft stores supply them in their jewelry findings" department, so I didn't.Fabric is not as dark and shiny as the picture.Not the elegant dress I expected.I didn't use it nearly as much as I thought I'd need to".Save your money for mfortable wireless bras-- now THATS something I'm glad I got while pregnant and now as a mamaAND would you believe there is no slit where any sensible men's wear would have an opening.Of urse, made in China.Very loose knit so it isn't really that warm.Not the gauzy tton I wantedExpected MUCH better quality for the money..It was so inexpensive that I decided to just keep it around for her to wear around the house after baths or the pool rather than sending it back.I purchased this after buying a short shrug poncho from this mpany that I am in love with.runs very large and material not mfortable.bought these thinking maybe they would fit, they truely are for kids.Looked nice, but it broke while she was taking it off the very first time she wore it.Good quality frame and lenses.Not nvinient to have important document get so low you have to dig it out of your private wares.Good quality wig.does not stick to your helmet very well.Came very smoothed in the package and wasn't able to be straightened out.This necklace looks much cheaper in person.The charm is very heavy on it's thin chain.The necklace itself would have been amazing without the glue, everything else seemed perfect and nice and shiny.I am giving this product two stars instead of one because the rest of the necklace was perfectThe bags are advertised as water proof.Champagne price for beer quality.Not high quality whatsoever.Not only did it not ver the breast but guaranteed spillage.NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY, WAS NOT A SWEATER SOME OTHER MATERIAL...Im not stretching my septum piercing for a piece of jewelry.The product is of good quality but they don't stick very well at all...Hopefully after I fix it the rest of it will hold together so I can finally wear it.Clingy and not flattering whatsoever.Fabric was ok.The minute the sun shines on it, you can see everything.I bought Heather Gray.I have purchased several pairs of these over the years and loved them.Even in strong outdoor lighting.To their credit, they're sturdy for the price.I am a fan of minimalist and barefoot shoes, merrell shoes me highly remmended.The toe box is large and the front of the shoe is very flexible, these are the things I was pleased with.These are my favorite sandals in the world but if the sizing is all wrong I will have to find a new brand to wear.The box is very nice, but the light did not work when I received it.Super soft T shirt like material.I purchased this shirt with my own hard earned money it was NOT GIVEN to me in exchange for my opinion.feel nice but mes easily unsewnGood quality otherwise.It looked nice but if you are top heavy it probably isn't going to workf for you.If you are looking for durability, it's not the one.deration is not secured very well so I had to sew them to ensure they would not be pulled offThe fabric makes me certain I should stay away from even the smallest of flames.It is mfortable and fits exactly like the picture.The fabric is not what I expectedWhatever the seller writes, these are definitely NOT wool socks.Do not dry in the dryer and wash inside out on delicate called.I expected a higher quality print.The fabric is pretty mfy.It's lightweight which I wanted, but quality of pockets lacking.Good for light use, but not for everyday use.Nice material and look of pants.Now because I don't have time to go to the store I have taped them together.Love the look but the actual thing doesn't work.There's always glasses out there that are dirt cheap can actually be fantastic.You can make them a lot better using items from the local craft store.It's difficult to find cute, fun, stylish plus size clothes.Not up to the Grundens quality I'm used to.The material is not as nice as the picture shows.It's so shimmery like a superhero stume.It is not flattering to body shape for a t-shirt dress.The quality is okay.Other than this problem it is a mfortable cami.With only one stud it's not enough to support the piece.One huge plaid table cloth is what this is.I really liked it but the fabric was not good quality.Other than that it's great material and super mfortable, you can hardly feel it.Returned because quality wasn't there.I was expecting it to be a slick material like the sleeves.Structured design with boning.Has a very strong odorThe fold over" part is supposedly adjustable but doesn't look good in my opinion when flipped up instead of folded down.Really cute if you're a stick figure.Nice shirt, clever and all, but it def.Not made for thick long hair at all.Not a lot of support for your breasts.But not very mfortable and no elastic on the sidesThey are wool mbination sock so they will keep your feet warmer than tton.I wear a lot bandannas in the summer working outside or riding my bike, it helps keep the sweat from getting in my eyes, that's why I bought it.I plan to keep it as it didn't st that much, but I'm disappointed in regards to the thin material and low quality.A lot of my other bandannas are thicker and much better quality.I guess this is how they make the wallet slim," by getting that bulk farther away from where it folds, but I don't see the leather wearing nicely given this nstruction.Shiny spandex material.Not ideal or what I am trying to get.These pasties were mixed.These are beautiful, but after only or times of wearing them, the beautiful rose gold finish has worn off.They would be perfect for bridesmaids, but if you're looking for regular wear, go elsewhere.VERY BEAUTIFUL NECKLACE, HAPPY TO WEAR IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT GAVE ME A RASH.Obviously I didn't expect the same quality and attention to detail, but I thought the UT kilt was dollar for dollar a better value.I don't love the positioning of the pockets on this one, they are kind of half-way between on the side, and behind, like it was a mpromise between the two.Material is not niceLuckily my mom can do alterations and make it decent.I will say the material is soft and mfortable and it is wearable.Pleased about the quality of the fabric.PU Leather is right.It's perfect for that.Has tons of zipper mpartments and a cross body strap.I've had this black hoop with the opal bead in my lip for about a month now.Unfortunately, the arm holes are cut so low, I have to wear a bra with it.quality seemed good too.Quality is okay.The material is a bit too thin and the length isn't ideal.Great fabric.I'm too lazy to return it, so I've thought of some creative ways to tie it up in order to give it some shape.Top wraps on and can't imagine That if you are actually going to swim in this that it would stay on.Honestly it's cute, obviously it's not high quality.It's not mfortable to wear unless you're staying at home.Not a great accessory.Looks pretty if you don't move.I do love their styles and the feel of the material so I might try another top in the future.The quality was decent and had they been the rrect size I would of kept them.Send issue, quality.They were really cheap so that's a plus.Nice but earrings are hugeThe bracelet itself was georgous and I was extremely satisfied with with the way it looked and shined.Nice material, pretty suitgreat fit and material but definitely not worth the price...you can buy next level shirts on amazon for like around with no logo and they are amazing.....It's soft and flowy and doesn't fray to my knowledge.Not too heavy, but still a winter topat.Cute style, but quality isn't great at all and WAY too short.The overall length was okay and it seemed thick enough for a California autumn.Although they were a perfect fit and very mfortable, I returned them because I wanted true white.Very mfortable, soft lace, but it is too low cut for me and not flattering on a smaller chest.It was so mfortable and the back is cute.Then, as I moved around a little, I realized that the design in the back isn't sewn into place.You can do that, but if you have ANY back fat at all, even the slightest bit, this bra will emphasize it to the world.I let the spouse pick the outfit and did not pay attention to many of the details.It will not sit nicely against the wrist and buckles up even when tight.The back does not fit well it has elastic so it does not look as nice as in the front.I got the ash" lor, the Android and apple" are the iron-on type and its shininess makes it so the apple doesn't really me across well.The photo looks much better than reality.The patterns are awesomeThis sleeve is very much to big for the Envy and there is no mfort padding in this product.They are not the most mfortable flip flop-I put an inner sole in and they feel just" okay.And because it doesn't care for water, it won't last very long.I found that if you hand wash the bra with little water, the adhesion is still somewhat) dependable.You have to untie every time you wanna take it off instead of it stretching over your backside.But I have to alterations to make them work, raise crotch, I am short, hem four to six inches, they will still be modest but no longer gauchosI love love leggingsTwo stars because they are opaque and the material is soft.I'm sure this would have been a great product, but mine arrived with the zippers already locked and with a de set.The dress cups are to big the straps too loose.I find the velcro that almost all hats have very annoying and it keeps getting my hair, so I thought this is itSadly, both have velcro, but they have also material that is just a tad elastic so that it is more mfortable again, for my own head).There should be a fabric under the sequins for mfort.Not very mfortable, rubs the ankle in the backI own two other Dooney bags and the quality of them are exceptionalnot at all mfortableThe material doesn't last.Item description is not accurate.Cute rings though.I like how she the fabric was.Perfect for summer.This pack was perfect for what I needed them for--I just used one each night of a weekend dance performance--but be sure to stretch them before and after putting them on to avoid early tears.It is unlikely that you will get them to last more than a day/night without ripping, but if you only need them briefly they are good.The photo shows it be tton, but it was a shiny material, almost like workout clothes material.Looks great on the model, but for me in was mpletely frumpy and unflattering.I wish I uld give a great review, but the watchband came apart right after we got it, and it can't be repaired.Okay qualityThe earings are beautiful but a stone was visibly missingThe novelty sweater has too many wires hanging on the inside they should have been lined on the inside to ver the wires so they wouldn't hang on your body or touch your body The shirt is high quality and really cute.I didn't like the quality of the printed words.Fits tight which is a shame since it's a nice looking sweater.It's very cute, but not leatherThere's no support the straps are too thin,the design is nice but thts about it.The threads were ming unraveled upon delivery as well.When travelling, I will move all my goods to my worn-out wallet.Will try to smooth the edges a bit.It is lovely though.Material not what expected.All in all not Allegra K's best work.They were very mfy and so cute just mad they ripped.Also, it is a synthetic blend of acrylic, wool, and cashmere.Emoji earrings are huge, too big for year old.The item looks good once you unfold it and bend the wires properly, but it is made out of cardboard and styrofoam, nnected by wire and gauze.The scallops are loose and don't fit to your body.The hat seems to be of good material, looks nice and is adjustable.I agree that it had a smell to it when I first opened it, but after airing out, it's fine.It looked cute, but I am not interested in artificial materials.It has a wintery scene I thought I uld wear throughout the winter versus a Christmas image that would be one season only.;-) Seriously, such marks indicate to me that it would not wear well, so in reality, they did me a favor.This is a great product if you don't like to sit, eat, drink, bend, arch, or breathe.I love the skirt.The skirt itself is beautiful and a nice material but I had top return it.....Also the chest did not lay nicely.They are pretty mfy though.Didn't like the quality.I will probably have to take this to the cleaners to have another layer of stitching added for assurance.dosent ver breast at all material not so good ddfor the price...I expected better fabric.I never wear it because it doesn't fit the ladies well, would work better if you don't have curves.The lace is nice and the material is thick though.It is very shiny and stretchy.They aren't adjustable like I had expected.The snaps are for easy removal after you have them on.Loved this for the first day I wore it... everyone mplimented me.The fabric quality was not what I expected.The material ..well its . worth.looks great, but the links gets disnnected sometimes, I lost a part of it alreadyThe strap is leather not my stIt is not stone.The material feels cheap, and the print doesn't look as good as on screen.It has a unique fun design but I purchased it because of the thin" design and it has the same bulk as a traditional wallet.The tear is so long, I was embarrassed to ask how long the tear was present.stiff and a bit long--not very flattering or mfortableI'm mixed.Everything that makes these shoes light, mfortable and extremely breathable make them flimsy, quick to wear down and easily damaged.It may have been bonded leather, but it was definitely NOT full grain leather.It didn't seem like it would hold up well, but would wear out very quickly with regular use.It seems impossible to find a durable, true full grain leather belt these days.Chain is so delicate.Very simple midi rings.For the price, it's a great gift or simple accessory.The material feels cheap and is see through, though it's silk I expected a better quality product.Unfortunately, the tton" material that it's made out of is super thin and just not as nicely made as I thought it may be.....I will be more careful when buying products from another untry.Not as expected quality no goodIt's a really nice-looking, mfortable, useful bag - I thought it was perfect until the zipper broke.I would have gladly paid much more - three or four times as much - for a bag of better quality.The sweater isn't as chunky and think as the pic.The picture made it look so much nicer than it really is.Notice they cut the Girls face from the picture and her leg warmers do not match the other suits.I'm not sure what these pants are made out of.Received in a plastic baggie with no Kendra Stt turquoise bag.Glad it was so inexpensive, but still don't waste your money.Wasn't made from tton, was more of a wind breaker material so there was no wiggle room whatsoever.The stitching was already ming loose as well.It's a great product.Doesn't look attractive.good quality and lor selection was good.Not great socks, pay more for better ones...I just wear an o-ring on the end to keep it in, it saves me a severe headache.Additionally, the white was very see-through so I'm sure once it gets wet it would just highlight any bumps or bubbles.see through mpletely.No support with elastic and bigger than normal.Dress has gold buttons, not silver as seen in the picture.I chose this wig because others said it held its shape through two events or at least through one evening which was all I needed it for).After using half a can of max-hold hairspray, shaping it into a point and hanging it upside-down for two nights, it was okay for the few hours I needed it.I would have returned it but didn't have time to find an alternate and now it's plastered with hairspray.The material is good, and no issues at all with the bathing suit being to tight causing the sausage effect".Also the straps aren't the most mfortable when I'm trying to balance out what exactly is showing.Looks great though.The product description is not rrect, this is not a boat neck shirt. stars for early arrival and it is as pictured.it did not look ok on my hourglass-leaning-toward-pear figure.The print on the fabric is okay, nothing special.It's not t-shirt material at all is more silk.The fabric bunches above the tie making you have to nsistently pull it down or your lady parts will showMaterial is great and lorFollowing the drying instructions still smelled) I hung it up to air dry and now two days later, I am not sure I can put it on it still smells.I gave it stars because it seemed well made.Fabric is beautiful so I'll make it into a skirt.Nice material thoughJust scratchy.This is a very basic bag, very lightweight, absolutely will not pass for leather.Would be easy to brush off dirt/sand.I really didn't like the feel of the fabric.Material was nice and looks match the photo.Still cute but not good for warmth.While this choker looks beautiful in the pictures, it doesn't work in reality.The tton blend was not at all as expected.It was light weight and breathable but the fabric felt more like that of a workout top.Only one side of the necklace has detailing.Not very mfortable I returned them.Expensive for what they areDoes not fit well ..if prime i would have returned it two stars for fabric softness and lor)Nice flow.Overall: made with very inexpensive materials, but price mitigates any major mplaints.Nice tie quality not greatDue to this issue, he has not been able to wear them at all.This makes me terribly sad because they look very cute and well made.I wear a size / and while I uld get them on, the fabric which was basically see-through right out of the package) was stretched so thin it showed everything.The pattern was nice though...When I received this item, stone wobbles.it is not sturdy.The slit ends above my private area / Fabric is very sturdy polyester.My husband is slender and is ' so finding shirts is quite a challenge.BUT I've ordered the same thing from the same seller and got a awesome tton one that was cut rrectly.The seller isn't nsistent but for the price it's with the chance.I liked the purse, but they put a fragrance envelope that makes the purse smell.But the dress is very see through.Warm, zy, super cute.It gets really ld here in the winter and I need something really thick.Looks stunning... For a uple of weeks, then it turns pper.It seems they are not secure enough on the strings.. Now the boots still look good its just that I wish the balls would of stayed on longerThey looked great on the picture, but in reality not so much.That part of the shirt was fine.Heavy fabric.The thong fit well so I kept the item just had to wear a different top.Bought the first one, the strap broke so we returned and got a new one.The pocket won't hold my package in place.The inside layer doesn't have any elastic to hold me in place.Suitable for high heels only.These are not suitable for babies for two primary reasons: .The bow is shaped by wires inside them.The material is soft and elastic but slips off easily from baby's head when she moves around the floor and in her stroller.These glasses are too expensive for the quality of materials.Very cute and quite stylish.This really more of a novelty than anything.Beautiful and mfy but sizing is off.The material is too firm so they are not adjustable, They do not stay on.Shirt looks nice and the material feels very mfortable.I love the design but not the best material and not put together well.The fabric feels nice but the size runs small.I loved them when I first got them but after weeks they started turning my ears green.It was more of a crop top than a tank top.They are actually glued to each other.It looks must better in the picture than when you get.The sweater material no goodBut they are beautiful.The scarf lost the pompons in a week .. Not a good qualityI use it as a night time shirt because its big and mfy.The wallet looked great though when I received it I did receive it quickly.Love the vest.At points you can see the base wig cap through the hair.There's no nsistency in quality here.The send set are much better but have about half as much hair on them as the first.It is cute from the outside and I love the idea of it.Nice grey and quality of jean.did not quite like the belt, good leatherOther lovely.Material was gorgeous and the pattern was solid.Didn't keep time properly don't think automatic arts work properlyThe dress was too sheer.The tassel was not attached to the ring.These yoga pants aren't thick enough to hide your panties.Beautiful bag butt zippers broke off and the tassles fell out two days into using it Item is very beautiful.Don't get me wrong the bag looks great and she loved it while it lasted, but a bag should last more than a few months in my opinion.I had to use a safety pin to pull the zipper didn't work great and was a hassle.Bottom line I wish I liked these bras more because they seemed like a great value, but there were too many issues.I don't know who gets off selling this stuff, its not good, it does not have the feel of the material in the picture.If you are looking for something cheap and cute to wear once or twice, this is perfect.It is my personal opinion the quality is not what I would find at an optometrist's officeGood for durability but not so good during hot summer days.The fabric and feel of the skirt was not to my liking and the fit as well.Great quality but sizing chart is extremely off.Very cute but price not appropriate for the amount of silver.The design of bow is awesome but should be slightly bigger and the silver more substantial.Get the cheaper stume version because this one isn't better.Its not as long as pictures.Just want a higher quality piece, even for a higher price.She has several princess stumes that they paired well with.They were great while they lasted, they just didn't last long even with easy use.not as nice as it looks in photoNice shirt to look at.There was ating layers I had to peak off.Not a fan, I didn't feel flattering in it.I didn't realize this was a homemade item.Quality seems nice, however I put watches in it and it would not close, and it didn't seem like it would protect the watch face very well.It worked great in the beginning but once I started to sweat it started to me off.It came new" but has no tags stating the size, who made it, where it came from, or what material it's made of.Loved the material and quality, but I would have ordered two sizes smaller to get a loose fit that didn't swallow me up...The other two bracelets are beautiful thoughThese pants are made in China.I made sure that the surface of my skin was clean and without any product.I can see these working for an eyebrow but don't buy them expecting them to work for a septum.The chiffon flowed very nice.wish it was softerWell made.Great design.Not the best quality and doesn't offer much support.Loved this shirt- only was able to wear once, the strings ripped in the wash first time I washed it .. beautifully designed with cheap materialThe straps are so wide they fall off.It doesn't support your back very well.Dress was to large and had to many hanging threads and when I ntacted the seller they offered me  of the  that I paid for it I see it's true you get what you pay forIt's just not as ol as I thought it would be, but nsidering the price, I shouldn't have expected so much.I got these to run and keep my keys or phone zipped up then hop in the ocean or pool, and they're just not flexible enough.I have been on the hunt for cute, fun, mfortable boyshorts for a while, due to their full verage, and typically) their ability to be worn under more form fitting clothing i.e.The texture was really nice and sift, as well, being mostly nylon, I was expecting this, anyways.And, of urse, with that, came the fact that they were riding up, and giving free wedgies.Important to note, which is not listed under the description, is that the lining of these underwear were not tton.The crochet part is all wrinkly and needs to be ironed probably each time it's washed.I binder clip works better, and is what I use now.I bought mine in the rose quartz lor, and it is very plasticky.There are small details that imitate a rocky" quartz feel, however.This ring is absolutely beautiful and exactly what I was looking for.Within minutes of putting it on, the tail bent up and I had to reshape it.Shorts are very stylish.The one from Choies is significantly higher quality and made SO better.They're too tight for him to wear these all day without doing damage to his circulation.The robe is fine.It's a lot better on paper than in person.This item was cute and I love it because it's so handy, but after only a few uses, it broke.Really wish they replaced broken ones because I love this case despite the fact that it broke...service was fine....none of that matters when product is not as expected.It was easy enough to glue a new one on though.manageableThe belt looks really good at first.Quality of the sewing was not very good.They took a blonde pigtail wig and stitched in the lored pieces.The functionality of this wallet is amazing.I would have loved it if not for the smellThe material wasn't what I expected.Great quality just waay to small if you have a brpad chest.Same price better qualitySuper mfy and cute.So I washed them gentle cycle.Air dry.Cute, but the high waist is really high and the wrap around has no padding and doesn't really hold your ladies well.The dress is mpletely see through.The seller was great about replacing the broken item and we were able to rennect loose jewelry links on the bracelet.It is a very nice crown except it wasn't welded in one place.Nice fabric though.The Tiara itself is nice, but the clip on the front that holds it to your hair came off immediately.Loved the necklace, wish the stone wasn't chipped...This outfit is definitely adorable, but NOWHERE near fitting my newborn.The quality of the jacket seems to be nice, but I cannot wear it.This year I wised up and looked for water socks to wear in the sand or poolside.The good: These water socks are very mfortable.- Price is reasonable.Looks way better in the photo looks like a tton-like yarn.Not happy, especially at this price.The shades have a nice design and can do the job.This is very mfy to wear all day and all night.That's very disappointing nsidering how  it was and also nsidering I was hoping to wear this - weeks.I'm not sure this will survive structurally for much more than a week.I won't be buying a replacement.These are very soft and mfortable but the material is too thin.Edges are unfinished.not real silverThis was NOT an infinity scarf.I'm keeping it because the material is soft I can wear it as a scarf or a shawl.A yoke style waistband that doesn't stay up.The under portions fit fine but the sheer dress was stitched without any possibilities of stretching.Material not what I wantedWatch is very nice, big bezel, stylish time piece with a lot of character.The dress was made out of good material for the price.Color scrapes off easilyThe shirt itself wasn't tight fight fine.looks different from the pic, it is gold thread not a lace applique.I will keep it cause it looks better on then in the package.I plan on returning the item because the st is way to high this quality of a product.Decent price but I'm planning on giving the shirt away because it is not what I expected.Jewels came off first wearI gave this shirt away bc it just didn't look good on me.Might look good on a petite frame, but not so cute on someone with curves.If you're looking for elegant and classy, don't buy this.It was made well and arrived in one piece.Not expensive and made in China where quality is very rare.The black part of the pants feel soft, almost like a microfiber.The design was pretty but had marks on the leather" right out of the packaging.The shirt is tton but not breathable.Do not wear outside on a hot day.I'm not happy with this product at all.Dose not hug curves as pictured and cuffs around thigh area, definitely ok for lounge wear...There is no elastic.The pants were shipped promptly and I received them in good ndition.For the same price, there are better alternatives to these pants.Not sure I'd buy this brand of maternity wear again.It is stretchy in some areas but in the areas it needs to be stretchy it is not.They looked great with so many tops, and they were so mfy.My guess is that in purse" just didn't have quite the right ring for attracting a male nsumer base.For those wanting maximum warmth and wind resistance, spend a little more for the Mad BomberShe loved this purse now it sits in the closet.I wore the belt, every day in a office environment.It is a beautiful shirt tho, no tears or anything just wished it was bigger and longerIn the back, the white line highlights my rump something most middle aged women don't want or, need to have further protracted.It's very pretty material and the buttons and button loops make the style absolutely adorable.The fabric is not awesome, but is not as sheer as others I tried like the stormtropper one) and it has the cape which is a good thing to have.Was not happy to see they were more of a spandex than a faux leather.good quality leather, very nicely made but too thick, not pliable enough and the zipper failed the very first time I put it to use.Great features, probably zero tolerance to normal use?This is a Vinyl Purse, NOT Leather, as stated in some of the reviews.The dress itself is super cute and very mfortable.It's a great non maternity dress, perhaps even after baby dress, but as a maternity dress I only can give it two stars.Not happy with the quality of the robe at all.This is a well made, high quality pant in many aspects.This was not a shawl it was a scarfI purchased this same item from another retailer, and the quality and fit way surpassed this suit.I disliked it because it wasn't long enough to the floor like it was on the picture but overall it was okAnd the shape gives the impression of form fitting but it's not.Good material...Was enough room provided for me to insert a thumb, or any one finger, if I should find the need to keep one finger warm at any given time.It is not made of brass.In American clothes, I rock a medium.It is a nice shoe but not what I needed.. too late for return because i needed these for my boys tournament and he had to wear them....The dress itself is a thick stretch material.Not made very well.Not sure what the elastic and clips are for inside.Maybe some rubber bands hair spray and bobbypins uld save it.Had many set baroque wigs before.Did not like the material it was fashioned from regret the orderGreat knock-offs but I uld have paid . Downtown Los Angeles is I wanted a fake product.It's wide and the material isn't really soft... Not worth itOn top of that, it shrinks after one wash, so I wouldn't remmend this.Did not like the material at alland you can see everything in my nostril.Leather started to peel off of the genuine leather" belt after a month of wearingDecent tie, heavy and feels like good quality.Nice bracelet but not functional for what it is supposed to be used forThe quality of the fabric used is very nice though.Won't buy another pair because the rear is not mfortable.Material is not high quality, kind of grainy looking.These are not good insoles if you have difficulty with your feet.I absolutely loved the style and material.It does NOT look as good as the picture.Quality material and hardware.Not really well madeNot high quality but if it fit i would have wore it with jeans or shorts.Honestly, I uld have spent the same amount at forever and got something better quality.Cute for a fitted short sweater but it wasn't what I was expecting when I purchased this sweater.Very cute top and quality is good.The actual cut isn't great.I don't like the material, it has a very synthetic feels to it, does not feel very good against your skin.Looks cheap .. but the dangle effect is nice.I measured my glasses as suggested and ordered.While neither pair are as good as my Ray-bans, the cheaper ones actually have hinges that hold them well on my face.I don't understand how it passed quality ntrol.NOT STERLING SILVER.Dislike because the clip-on wires won't let the glasses rest on the right place.I like the shirts but the fabric it is not good it like the umbrella fabricIt is cute, but it won't keep a kid warm.Nice shoe but only one of them actually worked.But as far as build quality and fit they seem rock solid.Scent remains after they were washed times in fragrance-free detergent.Why sell pajamas that are highly allergenic?I bought these for a mfortable fit only - but maybe their purpose is for running a marathon?I'm only keeping the shirt because it will be good to layer up with, but it isn't what I hoped it would be.Love the fabric.It is shear so you need something under it.It only has pockets for panties.I needed a box to store my bras flat because they are very expensive and I didn't want to fold them.The lights will not stay attached to the sweater.Distressed tees are my fave when they're done right.Sags in the pool and not flattering once wet.There is minimal padding in the chest and when I tried it on the padding didn't sit right or ver the right places fully.VERY cheep feel to the fabric and quality of the nstruction of this.It looked much nicer in the picture.You can see the lines from the boostCute and mfortable but makes me itch after a few hours nickel allergyIt's a bit scratchy but still seems to be will put together.Material is mfortable, nice design.It looks great in the picture.The gloves are definitely warm but not what I expected.I leave it in the car while I work and each time I get home and get ready to take it inside, I find another little embellishment laying in my seat.The purse would be great if all of those touches added to enhance the look stayed on.The gold finish rubbed off onto my fingers the first day I wore them.I have many dooney bags in leather and ated tton.Quality was not good and lor was mpletely off.Lace does NOT hide the goodiesLooks better made than it is.Not impressed with the stone.Beautiful Robe, I bought it along with several tton gowns for a trip to the hospital.The gowns held up as expected and are nice and soft.I have mixed feelings about this necklace.The inner gold/teal necklaces sit higher.However it is a little bit worn out just wearing minutes in water play class.I think they name the type of fabricthat was used and state the quality as well.Charms too big for the chain.Looks like stume jewelryLooks much better on the picture.Product is over priced.Too large and slippery vinyl.Material was more night shirt than dress wear.Didn't know this was dry clean only, and the steelers emblem doesn't look good.They're fun to pass around at shows, but they're heavy to wear on your head.Material was ok.Not the support I was expecting.Not everything perfect to wear.Good quality, but WOW runs very very small.But the customer support was Excellent in understanding the issue.did not realize it was embellished with an embroidery design.The quality is definitely not from the USA.The material was thinner than expected but still nice.It might be the type of material you would expect given the price however it would be a mfortable summer top.Not very happy with this product, it doesn't look as nice as in the pic.I DON'T CARE HOW WARM IT IS.Material would be to hot to wear as pajamas,also fit to low on the waist for my likingThey do not hold up well after being washed a uple of times.good quality pretty smal, my Dougther is size s, was to smal .. so order more size, She lkes but no fit on her.Also, this material isn't really that great.Beautiful dress but everyone has a different build.While the fabric quality is nice, I think the sizing is misleading.I'm guessing it's the packaging.Works okay on flat faces.Made in ChinaUnfortunately, I have wide feet, tough to get on and were not mfortable.It's okay, but the strings are a little bit loose and it isn't swimsuit material.I know opals are pretty delicate, so I was very careful with it.I would have thought the settings would have kept it secure, or the stone would have been glued in.Won't be able to put things in that I don't want to move around AND poking at my upper back at the same time.Shoulder straps need more padding.Zippers feel cheap and doesn't slide easy all the time.All in all it looks better than it functions.They were very cute, but are not as big as the picture makes them to be.The stone is so large it reeks of not being authentic.Very pretty, but please keep in mind that the pattern is not symmetrical on both sides.I haven't worn it out once.Might look ok on others, but just not for me.These earrings do not look exactly as the pictureIt was an okay bra for being home no support for a going out braGlasses felt like you bought them at a store.This thing is cute, and good quality for a swimsuit.Suit looks very nice and the material seems of good quality, but the sizing is way off.The picture looks a lot better than up close.cute but ALL polyester, no ttonI loved the print and design of this suit.The plastic clasp in the back is not a good design feature.Even with cut nails, he will still leave scratch marks on himself.I love the fact that these mittens are made with organic tton but they are not softI am also not a fan of the velcro.As far as quality goes, it was well made with good material.Only one word for this necklace, chintzy.When I got the the top there was a defect in the material.A white line where the ink in the material didn't nnect or mplete.A bit short for my style and material feels inexpensive.Great print, soft fabric but doesn't have much stretch, which is important for baby clothes.I expected a nice top for a date night but I will probably never wear it based on the appearance.Not a great snapbackThis is very see through material.I didn't care for the style either.Fit is accurate and mfortable, but stitching is an issue.As for a plain clear case, it works great.Attracts dog hair and lint like a magnet.They look great, feel good, and fit well, but my son wore holes in both big toes within a week of owning them.The silver tones are different.It was exactly what I was looking for and looked really great.Invest in a higher quality suit/ one you can try on better.Not a winter at, no warmth at allQuality of the cloth is just okay, not very great.A zip out lining would add more time to wear the at.Quality seems good but lor variety not good.The fabric is very nice and as described, but the way it is sewn puts several layers of pleated and gathered fabric right at your waist line.Not a good quality.The first shirt is % tton/ % spandex % polyester.Not too impressed with the look and qualityIts absolutely adorable and she loved it.Good price but not a quality product.It's also made out of a stretchy/shiny spandexy material.I wish these were a thicker material with a stronger waistline.It is bulky and the design not so nice.Material mfortable but needs brushing all the time, every speck of dust or hair bemes attached to it.Quality fabric wonderful at but not for the reasons stated above.This is a very nice looking shoe but Amazon had it was titled as a running shoe".These are quality workout pants.Stones were out of beads when it arrivedVery spandex-like in quality.Hard to wear in a classy way, too princess-y.I loved the material.I so wanted to love these aqua socksIf they were they would be absolutely perfectThey are nice and warm but they are such a hassle to get them pulled up and to stay up.It's ok. Hard plastic not soft.She finally broke them and so I bought her another, but they were a mpletely different pair.Cool shirt but not what I thought it would beWill probably add a star if extended usage proves shoes and cleats are durable.but would be perfect for a free hanging or something very lite.Love the style and material.Great fit, but the fabric is rough and scratchy, even after several cycles of washing/drying.I love the design but maybe not so good for the area I guess.This isn't leather at all.They did not feel as good a quality as the fabric the top was made from. I am motivated to get some of this weight off so I can go shopping in my own closet.It's light and clingy, so works in hot weather, just wish it was actually tton.The lei is lovely, but not very durable.bottoms don't have good elasticnice looking and well made.Not happy with straps.It's exactly like the picture.Having them for a little over a month and wearing them sporadically does not give me nfidence they would last.My husband was highly allergic to this ring.On a positive note, seems high-quality and is super heavy and sturdy.The pendant is pretty good, but if you're going to buy this necklace, get a new chain for it.I really wanted to love these, but I was looking for support/pressure low over the incision.I did not know what tton blend meant, it is like a swimsuit material.Not the most mfortable but cute.Quality isn't great but hey it's to go with a stume.Beautiful box but lid was broken loss from hingNot very good quality lasted me a uple of monthsI will have to add material to the lining to be able to wear it.Could have been a great shirt if only they had finished sewing the lace down.I can fix it, but I'm disappointed that I have to work on it before I can wear it.I was so gentle with them and kept them in a hard glasses case and everything.:( Very disappointing, because I loved them enough to wear every dayNo support, no verage.Not quality expected.Hope future customers get the more sturdy necklace.No chest or push-up support, which i expected there to be.the bottoms were great but the top just didn't work well for my shape.Since I needed it for an ugly sweater party and I love the design of this so much that I overlooked the shotty craftsmanship.Such a shame since the cut is very nice.And my baby who likes to walk won't be able to walk on these because the sole is not rubber or not good for walkers.I still wear it, but it's definitely dislored upon closer inspection.Expensive for what it is made of.Glasses look really nice in the pictures, but are not as high quality as I would have liked.It vered the sun pretty well so it serves the purpose.Material not the same as the Genie Bras I have, not as strong a fabricAnd it's not like the picture in the breast.The plastic can easily break and the clip isn't that good.It is made of a non-ferrous non-magnetic) metal.I had opted to cancel it the day before it arrived because I found a Slate Stone fitted at at Burlington Coat Factory for .Dry Clean and have it altered in the waist.It's a at I would keep by the door to run out and pick up my UPS boxes, grocery shopping and taking the kids to school because is warm and lightweight.Not a genuine leather.Feels like a sand paper on the inside.Looks good but seams are splitting after a week.I just feel like it isn't realistic for today plastic money world.Didn't care for the style at all of the top).The idea is different and ol the quality is alright.The overall craftsmanship of the wallet is great.they are light and they float.I don't exactly have the figure for clingy fabric.The design looks great, but I am returning it due to lack of quality for the price point.If you get this product be veryyyyy careful.I recently purchased what I thought was ONE charm with the cats the picture looked great on line.Upon arrival I had received low quality cat beads?The quality is overall well stitched and the buttons are on point.It's made in China.The one interior pocket is real.The picture looks better than the product.I'm pretty dos pointed even for the price.The image suggests ntoured tailoring.Material was soft but the fit was more like a man's muscle tank not flattering and very boxy like fitQuality of material seemed just ok.Still a bit amall, but can wear it opened mfortably, the lace has a stretch to it and the silk is smoothBeautiful necklace, but arrow is very tiny.Not very good quality but can mplain wasn't very expensive.If it didn't have the hole it would have been a five star item.Otherwise without the hole I can invision it as a very sexy top I would have liked to have worn for my boyfriend.Totally lace and see thru up top.... and I didn't expect it from the photo.Magnetic did join right, long length was shorter, quality not as good as others purchasedWife didn't care for it.Sure the package is pretty, but what's the point of that?I'm looking for mfortable socksMeh, not what I expected The quality is not goodIt doesn't look as nice as the picture.I paid a little under for it and for that price I wouldn't remmend buying it.And the diffraction isn't crisp.I bought my friend a cheap pair of knockoffs that were really loved and passed around.Otherwise, it's fine for the price.The gown is lovely.There area few differences between the photos.Earring itself is pretty.Two stars because the price is low.I think if I was a thin teen I would love it but top is not for anyone older.The print makes it look cheap it looks a lot better in the amazon photos).Certainly the buckle is easier than the traditional one.It felt fine, but you uld hear a crinkling noise whenever you touched the earmuffs and they did not fold like they were supposed to which I needed so I returned them.I would have kept them if they had folded nicely even with the crinkly noise.My thought was, what a ol skirt-like piece that I uld wear with leggings underneath for warmth while teaching this winter.This is not very sturdy.Sturdy but lightweight.Material is great, hats seem great for fall and winter.Look at the customer review photos for an accurate depiction.I wish they were a little more slouchy but these will work as functional hats they just are not stylishNice fabric and tailoring.The dress isn't as flattering as it looks on the model.Doesn't look good on me.She ware it x for a period not exceeding weeks total.But very cute design.Well made though.Bathing suit looked and felt fine.They also aren't very well made, already ming apart after just a uple of months with minimal use.I would have been better off spending more money and buying better quality.I mean, a white bra shows through perfectly.Feels like it would be super mfy though.Mine arrived with plenty of seeds inside, but one had already fallen apart by the time it arrived.But it seems well made.This product is worth maybe or .Nice appearance but key holders not secure.Fabric wise this was a great purchase nice and stretchy if a little less give on the waist band.Nicely built bag, heavy material.The adhesive it's not as secure as it should be.Ok qualityThat piece was made from a stainless steel washer.I will ntinue to wear this so long as it doesn't cause skin disloration or irritation but I would not purchase it again in the future.Shipping is from afar, but the prices and the jewellery make it worth the waitGood quality but the extended strap is missing one clip that hooks onto the purse.Still a rather cute design.The material is like a swim suit.Scratchy materialLittle too heavy made my nipples feel like athletes foot, super sensitive and fiery.Nice sized face, easy to read numbers... the glass was really clear on the face until I had it on while I was giving my kids a bath.It is so beautiful.I think you uld probably get the same benefits from a cheaper version.This dress was absolutely perfect.It states % tton, but these are in fact % visse.This is so disappointing because it fits perfectly and it feels so mfortable but its just the imageI love how they look and feel but what good is it if I can't wear them.The quality is NOT what I paid for.The pockets are exactly as I desired.I suspect a thinner individual will find these ideal.It is a nice leather inside and did ship in much less time than it said, but I would not buy again and I'd look elsewhere for a wallet.The shirt is okay just definitely what i expected.The material doesn't last long, I have to buy a new oneDoesn't look as nice up closeI would like to say first off these earing are truly beautiful.This is really disappointing when i felt that i had taken over days searching for what i felt where the best sets i uld get.True they were not expensive so i understand the you get what you pay for" bit but to me already broken and to break in your hands is the reason i have to give a less than perfect review.Like i said these earing are beautiful and i would get the again but only if i knew that they were made better.They are way to sheer for that purpose.Might as just have her run around in the yard in her diaper if the weather is warm.I had far too much fabric at my shoulders, even when the dress fit well over the rest of my body.The fabric is not mfortable as well.I order a lot of clothes from over seas and I prefer the quality of ALLEGRA K.They have a nice fit and they are mfortable, but they break easily on the seams.It's a nice lor, but the chest area is immense, and some of the gems won't stay in place.This pullover just did not feel right to me on my skin...To me it looks great in the picture...But, the feel and fit just did not work for me at all.I absolutely love the lor and the fabric quality.It was just not well made.Great fabric and design and it fits very well, too.Not mfy.I feel like a brick in this dress.Looks better in pictureNot Jean material and its not form flatteringThe little dots look like they uld be sequins, sparkly cloth, rhinestones or beads but in person, they are solid little dots of lored cloth.I didn't feel mfortable bending over.Quality wise, Just One Star..Beautiful lor and exactly as shows, but size and quality of material is way too thin and buttons were practically falling off.I was not too happy with the quality or fit.But I DO like that, with less revealing tops, all you can see is the added cleavage )It was not a flattering fit.I loved the pattern and really wanted this to work out for me.Looks very expensive-- if you don't mind fur in your mouthBut for  I would expect better quality.The material is not that great but for the price it's ok The fabric is very soft.It's looks better online than in person.Everything else fits fine.It is a beautiful dress though.The lors are true to the picture however there is not a single bit of stretching knees so they are not very mfortable.I absolutely love this bagI just wish it would have been made with quality metal clasps and zippers.If the tops had the little siline strips to hold them up like most shapewear) I think it would alleviate this problem.Beautiful item from the beginning but brakes down within a weekThey are not the smooth mfy tton that my other pants by this label are.There is no type of elastic in this romper.And the material is a little thicker and more textured than I expected.The quality is fine.Very thick material.Super mfy.Had one pocket.I thought it would be better qualityVery see thru not thick at allI got these for my wife as she needed inexpensive sandals to wear in the shower.Although they are very light and as mfortable as you would expect from a sandal in this price range there is no arch support the bottom has already torn after about a week and a half of light use.ol looking but can't wear.They feel great and super soft, however the sizing was mpletely off.I will have to add some fabric to the bottom to make it longer.Very beautiful ring.Great product but wouldn't wear it everyday just special occassionOverall pretty dress for the priceThe fit is off and the design is not flattering.The lors were nice together but the fabric and fit were not happening.Super mfortable, but too translucent.Product is super cute and looks great on any body shape...however material is very light and it will not maintain nice appearance through very many wash cycles.Looks cute on, but not sure it is worth it when things easily break.Material is not well made but I guess can't ask for much base on price.No way uld wear alone especially if you have any type of chest that needs support.This suit would be perfect if it didn't have a built in bra and too much padding.I can't believe this broke.Considering how inexpensive this was.However, it's beautiful.I ordered this for me, but once I saw it in person, it looked only good enough as dress up play jewelry so I gave it to my preschooler.I wasn't so happy with this because the one I liked most was broken and was packaged to me which I feel wasn't right to do to a customerGood quality Love the topFirst, I must say that this is a beautiful at, the price is very reasonable, and the quality of this at is very good.A quality itemThe material and lor are pretty the cut is simple but good enough for the price.It's mfortable but it helps flatten your rolls, but doesn't help a ALL to lift butt.Don't buy this if your hoping for a butt lift.It feels like cheap jersey material, not that nice blend most bodyn dresses are made of.It stretched within the first time wearing it, and stopped beming keeping things in place after using it for one heated yoga session with minimal arm and shoulder movement.Wish it was more durable and supportiveOverall, they were well packaged and seemed of decent quality.it look like easy to breakMaterial is very light and you can see thru it.I don't like the material, because it's hot and sticky, on warm/hot day, however, the lors and pattern are pretty.Not for ld weather, these are just for fashion.Cool for the springtime.The lace will roll and does not display well at all.Looked so cute in the pucture.Can see sweat marks.Nice ncept but in reality just don't stay put.The shirt has a nice quality but I got a medium and it fits really tight and it's a belly shirt.The pin is not replaceable and if damaged, the whole unit is throw-away inexpensive, but I prefer things that are repairable.It looks great before you buy it.The material is not of good qualityLook nice, but unmfortable.The quality seems good and the lor is nice, maybe a little darker than the picture.LED lights only work a few times.It's not as nicely cut as the picture.This was nice for the first few times I used it, then it broke.Very low cut and not enough verage on top.Only reason I'm giving it starts is because my daughter still loves it despite its flaws.Not at all impressed with the quality of the product.The quality seems fine.The ring is styled nicely, except the the add was misleading.This was totally unflattering on me.I purchased this as I liked the design and uld not find the black frames with wood on sale and I liked them for the first few weeks.I will say that I LOVE the look of this dress, the lace is very nice.It may be that I have sensitive skin but I uldn't stop itching, the material was so scratchyThe skirt was perfect the top is for someone who is an A cup.Nowhere near as long as it looks in the picture, but the fabric and lor are nice.If it had fir properly it would have worked out for what I needed.Beautiful material, beautiful pattern wanted to badly to pair with a sleek black turtleneck and black cardigan but whoopsIt looks like a print based on a marker loring.Material is heavy, which is good but it's too stiff as well.Exposed zipper in the back is white, which ntrasts against the turquoise skirting.not very strongI would say the material was not great.Sequins keep falling off hope there are still some left by the day of danceWith little movement it rides up.Cute shirt, but I wish the descriptions were a bit more reliable.Not as vibrant.Well, I waited too long to return this, but I feel the beads are glass and not really semiprecious stones.I left stars because it is still very cute, but I really wish it had been made of higher quality metals.The product I received is not like the photo at all.I chose this one because it matches the movie version where the top is black leather.Looks nice, but does not match the photo at all.This Skirt is not for anyone with curves.Didn't care for the material.The purse was amazing, the wallet is not made with good material.Not as pretty in person.Somewhat not sure how well it is made.Material is not good quality.Not grass green.Wearing this without the liner would be like wearing plastic wrap.I think there should be better nsistency in the product.looked good.All in all it is okay but the quality isn't what I had expected.Luckily they send a lot of studs for a low price...Not very good quality material.They just don't seem to be very well made.I was hoping it would be a bit sexier, but it needs a good steaming to get the hard wrinkles out.Quality seems okay, but it might as well be trash material because of the fit.other than that, its a very pretty shirt.They're super fun, and the kids love them, but I'd say they're closer to dollar bin quality.The material was of good quality.Not only was the tunic a bit too small no roominess but the quality of the material was much below standard.The material is great quality though, its mainly the fit that isn't great.I'm disappointed because I love everything else lors, style, design, softness, material).Material is good quality, lor is nice but the rhinestones are a disaster.I think they are ok if you have to walk on grass for a wedding ceremony but if the event is in grass or gravel for several hours, maybe you should buy wedges or fatter heels.Product satin but it is very thin (the symbol is off-centered and the rope across the front is not braided as shown in the photo which was the reason i chose this particular hat in the first place).These are ok I wish they were a bit longer but the work I use them as earrings not sure what the are meant for but work well enough but I wish they were a bit longer and lighter they seem heavyIt's a gorgeous case with an inside that was designed horrifically.They didn't hold up great in the wash and had snags in the material.This is not swimsuit materialI wanted to wear it as a tennis dress but the material is just not breathable enough so now it sits in my closetI Am a female but have bought board shorts for years.The material is actually nice and printing is also good.Pants this baggy should hide a pocket or two, as well, then I'd be all over them.It is only a scarf.Not good quality from the fabric, button and design.Not the nicest qualityIf you don't care about the number of fingers, white parade gloves work well for cartoon characters.Biggest mplaint from my wife is the bands don't stay in place and keep vering up the charmsThought the lacing and gems were silver but they were gold.It's as advertised, and the quality is fine--but it's TINY, just inches by about -/.I question the durability of that strap, too.It doesn't feel like it will withstand a few thousand stretches.good productI thought this bracelet would be a lot thicker than it was.It was not a good investment.just straight flat ribing.This ring is beautiful.Won't wear it for fear of losing the stoneFake belt but looks goodLoose fitting.But the leather is really nice..Not nice enough quality for the price.Looked good too.I have many of their products because their quality is great.Material Nothing flattering, Pretty lor I thought.Two stars for quality and overall look, but mine are going back.As a female, I bought these as a pair of shorts that I uld sleep in during a Girls Weekend.Not at all a mfortable sleeping pair of shorts.It's a interesting item.I wish the shirt actually looked like the one displayed that would have been even better.I purchased the blue bird print top because I thought it was adorable and a great price.Low quality product, you can just easily DIY this and have a better outme.Also it is more pricey than some of its mpetitors so I was expecting a lot more from this product.Apart from the existing damage to the item when received, the sun-glass looks nice.The straps are not long enough and there isn't enough side-boob verage.Gave as a gift and the receiver loved how cute they were.These diamond studs arrived on time and in an everyday case.A diamond ought to sparkle in the light, but these were milky white and not of great quality.Material doesn't seem durable, but OK for the priceProduct does not look at all the same as the photos.The sweatsuit is not the best quality but it's OKCute but needs a better way to put on.But cute with leggings.looks great but the legs were a bit tight cutting into me.Otherwise, the item came in on time, looks well made, does smell like real leather.It's beautifulFeels like felt.With a nicer sash and tulle filler skirt under the dress it would have looked nice though if I had been able to wear it.They were EXCELLENT shoes while they lasted which was less than months.The lenses look great and fit perfect and for a great price.The set I received were polarized and everything at far is perfect but there is a slight blur on electronics/lighted objects at close range.I knew this wouldn't be a high quality dress but the fabric was thin and highlighted any added weight from the pregnancy.It's a very thick leather belt.I don't need visual distraction on my stomach as i am average weight.If it had been real sequin material this dress would probably be one of my favorites.I bought a pair of Ear Bags at the same time and they were a lot more mfortable than these.I led strip works and the battery too, but I can't turn them on with the little button.Not as pretty as the picture as well.Otherwise, expect to do some alterations, or just buy something else.The dress was also surprisingly heavy.I will keep it for role a role play night for my significant other.The opening at the ankles of the i play shoes is huge and the shoes don't stay on if you are in moving water or sandy areas ocean, lake, etc).They work great for a splash pad or for the back yard if you just want shoes that aren't going to get ruined in the water.Quite stretchy.It got gold zippers on the sides as pretend pockets" accents.Flowers are glued on....If you're not sensitive, then you'll probably love them.It's not long enough for woman with booty like myself Looks nice as a long top but feels more on the low end/ budget.Every drop of snow sticks to the gloves because of the fleece.Would only be good for lder areas that have no snowAlso, there are several spacing issues regarding the beads and the knots.If the elbow pads were sewn in the rrect spot it would be a much better shirtMy girlfriend and I enjoyed the look, feel, and useable space.Material was not that great but you get what you pay for.Fit is as expected, but material isn't as night as I would have liked it to be.for the price I was expecting better quality.Not as flushing or mfortable very baggyIt's very obvious at the waist where the fabric is gathered in.If they can figure out how to cut the pieces out straight before sewing the dress together, I would love to buy this.It was very voluminous and the straps very long.I did not love this wallet.It just did not fit right I throw it in the garbage and call it waste of time and lostIt had a sheet o paper in it(which I was fine with) but the fact that it said I love you it's a secret" made me think of all the women that died in a criminal minds episode.If that is something that is in every locket fine but it was not in the description ANYWHEREsturdier then my last belt which had metal that would bend I lost the pin because of that* It looks good.Material was great, but the cups are just like the other reviews stated, oddly placed in the middle of the dress.Not like picture, not a nice round slope to the longer part of the shirt.It was a nice material and Arrived quickly.Warm, good material.Not this one, Some kind of flaps form at the sides, as if there was extra material; simply not well designed.It looked awful on me, but great on my roomate.It digs into my ankle and is very mfortable.This is awefulYou can't move in this it's not moveable material.Looks beautiful on the model.did not like the material, not soft fleece, very polyester feel.The wrinkles came out, so that was good.I wish it was the same as the skirt.I love a fluttery cap sleeve, so these are beyond a disappointment.And the design isn't very good either.I would say it is not because the stones are blue as I have other earrings that look better than these.I was expecting a more fitted look and the material wasn't very soft.Nice for the price.I felt like the bracelet track needed to be deeper.Other than that, they are soft and seem to be made okay.I loved the style and the print of the fabric but there was just no way this was going to look flattering on me.Hopefully the next one i order is sewn rrectly.it does't look good, it's vulgar / The quality is ok.My son was excited about that as he is not fond of the clip on sitting on his neck.fabric was very nice but it just would not stay closed all the way down .. runs too small for a woman with curves ..This looks so lorful and vibrant online, but isn't in real life.Doesn't lay like picture shows.The fabric looks good.It is a very ol design, however.The hooks aren't very strong, and my fixes aren't seeming to helpFabric and workman's ship was excellent but the size was at least sizes off even after measuring the person.The fabric is suburb, almost too nice" says my son who works in a busy catering kitchen.His jackets take a lot of abuse, so he's not sure how this fabric would hold up over time.It's not stiff like other jackets he's had, and feels soft and more like all tton.It looked great and very upscale, and the first thing my son said when he tried it on, was: wow, nice."It was solid black with no silver on butterfly piece.Beside that good quality and well designed.I sewed it up and then it happened on the other side of the pocket.Cool T shirt but you have to be lbsNice fabric, but it too large.The lor was not as vivid and the material was very thin.This is not made to go in the water or to wear on a beach.You have to rely on yourself to tie it rrectly, but there is no breast support.It feels scratchy, and it's some type of a rayon material.Meh...buy yourself something with higher qualityMy daughter is in month clothing so I bought to months swim diaper.Cute and very everything fit well and then yeah first time I was it the whole zipper and everything on the dress was mpletely jacked.Good quality but I wouldn't buy againNot the quality I had expected.Because the fabric is stretchy, it is wearable, but not flattering.Advertised as a tton T I was expecting a different feel to the fabric.For the price, this dress is fantastic.Loved the glasses but there was a huge scratch on the lens and a scratch on the frames as well.I got the purse for my wife as a Mother's Day gift.The make of this bra is so nfusing, as the front is ok, but the straps and placements are really not mfortable.The straps slide down too quickly and its not ideal at all.However, works great as a toe ringSave your money and spend the extra for a quality jacket.I am changing my review because after the wash I am not happy with my purchaseFlimsy, flex with gentle use, tint is pretty light so not very helpful for bright sun.May be good as stume jewelry or on Halloween but definitely not for everyday use.Not exactly what I expected from the look of the pictures.The material is itchy not soft.Otherwise good material and well made.See, the material is nice and soft but i uldn't really tell that it was a shell, also it fit me like pastiesIt seemed as though it would likely be light enough to leave me unencumbered on a warm day.Pretty much just expensive Lycra shirt.The fabric was different than I expected and it felt like a nightgown made from polyester, the kind that doesn't breathe" at all; so it's actually too warm for wearing on a hot day.It is mfortable though...The material blend I don't care for.The pendant itself is beautiful.To slinkyIt is mainly silver pave, with small, dark green stones interspersed.As I rule, I'm not a pave fan, but the image on Amazon looked so attractive and stone-laden that I thought I would love it.It uld be a great dress if it were made were made properly but at this price I guess you get what you pay for.It was a beautiful dress to wear but I wish the quality of the elastic was better.It's well made.I expected it to ver my lower neck better.Even with a little bit of walking it slides down my pregnant tummy . Not mfortableThe leather itself smells wonderfulMy breasts were not held in well by this design which resulted in me not using it.Made me sad because I love the styleI can forgive sizing if quality is good, but for me, it just wasn't.some of the threads were loose right out of the bag and it just didn't feel like a quality pie of clothing.When I buy clothes I pay close attention to fabric.I loved the fabric, however.It was way too long for me but an attractive top.The back of the slippers are not sturdy enough.The material feels nice enough.The design has a different maker than the other two and feels mpletely different.not the quality I thought I was purchasing.Very soft material, kind of chiffon shiny) and not tton.If you were petite I would say this is probably OK, it appears to be handmade and the craftsmanship looks pretty good.as the original glass.When driving on the road it can rain and then be sunny causing a l ot of bright glares.The material is nice, soft and mfortable.I uld live with that because of the price, but it wrinkles easily.I've only worn this item a few times and one of the steel bones is ming out at the bottom, wish I had returned itIt still looks nice but it's missing details such as the outer circle, the lor of the symbol as well as even the necklace itself.I SMOKE KINGS SOFT.THE LEATHER IS VERY NICE, SOFT AND DURABLE.Pendant separated from chain first time it was worn.Screen Printing Text Adjustable Snap Back One size fit most As seen on TV, worn by Donald Trump, Presidential candidate running for office in I will be returning this item.Too much bling but if you like that it would be perfect.Though not ugly, nobody will nfuse it for something better than it is.Fabric is thick.Beautiful necklace and came on time but not worth the tarnishing...it's a one time weari purchased this dress for my wife.The gems are not stuck in there well, either.It looks quite lovely in the picture but not so much in the real when I received it.While this is a well made product I'll have ask did anyone survey people to see how many cards people have to carry.They would be perfect if the design stone part didn't fall off.Makes me sad, please make them better quality, i love these earrings.Its cute, but felt like I paid a lot for something not great quality.The lenses are great, and I uld see perfectly on my morning mmute which is always into the direction of the sun.Nothing wrong with the seeing" part of these glasses.I expected way better quality material.It's a great picture but very flimsy material, if it had some kind of interior liner I would love it more, Lots of space and pocketsTO BIG FOR MY TASTE..It is very mfortable and does look cute.I found myself having to adjust it just to get it unstuck from my arm reference information, I wear medium in shirts, large in ats).I thought the plastic material would be thicker.Fabric good.I'm going to have to do some alterations on this.It's beautiful and it does keep the sun from burning my dllet, only problem is the glittery material that flakes off everywhere.Very cute but more loose than any other beanie I've purchased, design would be better with a rim or band around the entire bottom, falls off my head too easily.The charms were not as pictured.Beautiful still though especially with bootsCool case for the price just not as pictured.This would be a really nice house if it was made better.Ok for a novelty but I would never give as a gift or nsider this real jewelry.Nice fabric, but the sizing was way offIt's a nice tshirt but the printing resolution is rather low and blurry.The patterns are nice and the body material is soft, however the band is a regular elastic band and not mfortable.After reading the description, I thought the band would be vered in fabric to be as mfortable as the seller described.The top is not lined, sewing quality uld be improved and the fabric is too sheer to wear without a full slip.The white is see through.The material is soft and mfortable, but I don't think my husband will wear it for anything other than Halloween.We are HUGE fans of Jack and this does not accurately depict the quality of their other products.There isn't enough material in the front panels to offer any verage.The fabric seems nice, but wrinkles easily.This detailed trim really is adorable however it's such thin materialGreat for summer yes but it stretches out and wrinkles so badly.I remmend defiantly going up a size if buying, you won't regret itBut if roomy rings are your thing, then you'll probably like it.These were not the same quality as the ones I purchased from TJ MAXX.They are much thinner and the stitching held up all of workouts.My hole as been stretched from hoops so these don't stay in at all.The material while plentiful was not very good.The cuff links and buttons were very nice though.It's shiny, not like the soft looking fabric pictured.Unless you are uber petite and don't mind the cheap fabric, I would not remmend.Quality not therehaven't worn itAfter days they no longer hold.It is nice but I feel that it just doesn't look as good on.I am very sensitive to smells and odors.Beautiful piece but only had it on for an hour and then it broke.It's a charming garment but I don't like the way the material feels.These seemed to be the perfect solution for my sensitive ears without a headband.The material of the band holds on to hers and scarves well, but the band itself slips off.Did not work for my use so it was returned.Much cheaper looking in person.Was larger then expected and st to return and still after weeks have not received a credit from this mpany, The dress was ok but not a favorite but still pretty.Fabric is wonderfully soft and the dress is pretty.Would be cute... if I was a stick figure While it did fit very well, but the qualify of the dress is ok and I am afraid that the skirt will not hold up and may shrink after few washes.Not what I expected from the description.I really thought the words Touch LED Watch" was a peel off clear film on the watch, but its part of the watch.but after two weeks LED is dim and don't keep rrect time.Not as nice as it looks in picture.The material is light, cheap, and clingy it would probably look nice on someone with no curves The sock material is way too stretchy and doesn't hold well.It is also made out of a kind of plasticky feeling material so it isn't mfortable at all.I was thrilled at the craftsmanship of the crystal lenses but the hinges worried me.Two stars for being cute and soft fabric.The shirt actually works better without the tie.For the price, all of this is to be expected, but the quality is so low I wouldn't use this for a formal event like a wedding.The strap is VERY cheaplt made as well.Fabric and quality very nice.They can be smelled from a distance of up to feet even.Fabric quality seems to be okay, but the fit?My ears are always sensitive to cheap earrings but not stainless steel so..... the CZ is nice looking but I don't love the setting.I really bought them for my daughters but not sure if they will be able to wear them either due to sensitivity.Loved it but it broke w in a wkIt is a see thru ribbed fabric that has a nice feel to it.Because of my hips, it would not stay pulled down, and rode up with every movement.The rings holding the charm on the chain and holding the clasp on were bent upon arrival.Material is very sheer.Too short in the torso and padding, which is non removable, did not work for me at all.Third the lever isn't well made I can see these breaking with regular use in less than a month.not tailored for american womenI don't care for the feel of the material or the way it looks on me.It's pretty but the descriptions are way off.There's just no material.The spring bars seem fine.I fell in love with this shirt when I saw on here.I do like the fabric.I don't exactly see the line when I wear the glasses but I'm not happy about it.Liked the design and fabric but size was horable.Wouldn't keep the neck warm outside the at.Not a great design.My two piece bathing suits looks better.Only reason for two stars is the nstruction, but i doubt I'll wear it enough to test that.It is definitely different, if not a little awkward fitting.fell apart when I used it for the first time, but very beautifulWhen I think of chain, it think of looped metal.Very cute hat but it is for a newborn.I bought for my petite month old granddaughter.I didn't expect high quality but this belongs in a gumball.I'm highly suspicious of the other reviews; can't imagine anyone would think this is something of quality.decent for the price but lots of glare in the sun, can not see with them on, defeats the purpose.Good quality, durable.Overall, jacket is lightweight and warm.The body portion of this stume is great.This necklace is really cute, and feels good on.I was so excited to get these, but was very disappointed with how mfortable they were.At first I figured it was bucks who care but the quality is such that I'll buy a different brand.I was having a Bolly wood baby shower for my daughter and I these and loved itButton holes not finished.The jewelry DOES NOT fit in the needlesThe top was a long piece of fabric that provided a few different options for tying.It kept rolling up so on the beach or matched it with a bandu top.You may also want to hem your suit as it is just fabric.Cheesy lookingThe underwear is more of a one time use because of the quality.OK scarf.The material is lovely and good quality.It was very shiny and pretty but the clasp did not close from the send wear on.The product arrived ahead of schedule, they look nice and seem pretty well made.Cute on a girl, well nstructed.Fabric feels good but it runs on the very very small size the band was firm fitting but had a little too much room in it for me.if you are looking for a mfortable stay at home bra for the weekend, i think this does the trick.it is very soft and mfortable to wear, and i was surprised by the quality for the price.the way the fabric mes around the edge of the zipper at the top and bottom is a nice detail and not overlooked.No do not feel like leatherI was not at all happy with this product.The little snaps came off right out of the package.Very cute but llects everything and never let's go.And the quality is a bit cheep.Their made for one time use only.The material was very soft and the lor is a little brighter than the picture.Some beads had fallen and seller mmunication wasn't the best.It's a rather heavy material and I was expecting something a bit lighter weight for hot weather.It was soaking wet when it arrived.The Sweetheart neck line is very pretty though.I bought a medium, and material does not appear to be able to be altered without damaging dress.Good product but not practical for daily use.This watch is beautiful but the band faded after the very first wear.Looked great when I tried it on, but how can I give higher than stars to a product that developed a hole in the crotch/butt after merely hours of wearing it?Nice shades, but breaks fairly easy.Sure, you can make it work with an outfit but was certainly not what I thought i would be receiving and took a month to get to me not worth your time or money....Nothing tribal about this thing.It's not made very wellSUCH adorable and unique shoesThis ankle looks great, and I like the noise it makes when I walk around.Will work for fall, but not for the real winter with snow and freezing temperatures.order this bead and was very happy with it, until a month passed and the lor rubbed off.The photo shows a gorgeous dress that looks to be made of chiffon or taffeta.The dress had two layers of tulle and an under layer of silk.Loved the print and dress quality.Brim too wide, texture of fabric thicker than desired.To be fair to the brand, the quality seemed great fabric, fit, cut, etc... all good.I loved the design of this bag, and in theory it would have been great for an overnight flight with an early-morning arrival.It slides over your suitcase handle, and has a nice outside pocket for tickets and such.The design was exactly what I was looking for.So I ordered a shoulder pad that velcroed onto it, and figured I would be set for the trip.Overall, a nice design, but the hardware needs to be sturdier.Decent hat, well-made, however, slouchy it's notI should've paid attention to its material... the picture made me wanna think it was tton, it's not.it's mostly nylon and makes me feel hot and sweaty in less than minutes.Otherwise, ol necklace.Well, okay, for the price, I can pick up some matching bottoms pretty easily.Be aware that the ears are NOT attached to the smooth headband.If you want to take the time to sew or glue them in place they would be better.I had to really force it over my D tits and it's not really mfy.Beautiful top at a good price eBay has it at double the price.I've been stretching it on a soccer ball for weeks.So no, this purse did not work for me.son thought they were the olest for the first few weeks.Very mfy and fits well.Not a flattering fit either.The print was just great looking though.Didn't love the fabric either/Sadly the shoulder strap broke about a month after I received it and one of the belt straps always mes undone.Disappointing because it looked nice.It's cute but . the purse is not leather as advertised .I got the rainbow ring, I love the ringI love this ringReally pretty though, just not very sturdy.Looks good for a bracelet.Packaging may have something to do with the odd shape so that uld be a factor that needs changing as well.Which was kind of expected with the price.Very cute and simple ring.Other than that, they were a nice product.At first I thought what a great idea even though it's way overpriced.The shirt itself it preciousI have several Naot sandals and love them all.I've not been able to wear it because it's so loose on meThe ear muffs aren't made with the best quality material, so when the wind hits the side of the ears, it doesn't really do much to stop the wind.Only works well when you have some sort of wind breakers hype hood to block the wind.Too tight and the plastic seems easy to break.The fabric is cheap polyester but the lours are great and just as shown.The fabric is smooth and silky and I liked it very much.This is a very nice, high quality wallet.You can tell a lot went into the craftsmanship and the materials are excellent.The woven finish definitely brings a level of sophistication to the piece and the stitching is flawless.This is teaching" the leather a dis-symmetry that I will be fighting for the rest of the wallet's life.Definitely not high quality, but cute.Chain of this I believe is plastic.I do like the quality and gifted to my mom.. Just was tighter than expectedIt's not expensive but I would remmend even spending this little amount of money else where.No inner lining... but I like it.All I will give this item is that it's extremely soft and seems to be made well.Every nice ring liking it so far the only think is it uld use more camo design its a little planI uld've attempted to make this myself but I figured if it's then it'll be a bit more quality work, but it wasn't.I ended up cutting the central strips to create a two-piece--works better but the top is still off.Also it is not very mfortable when you put it onThe sweater looks good, I will still wear it.I thought this would be perfect but I got bad lines on my chest instead (It truly is not a great shirt.The delivery time and packaging were satisfactory.Beautiful watch.It is very warm so it's great to give to GoodwillI bought this dress for maternity pictures.My son loves these shoes because they are light weight and he learned how to tie his shoes on these.Didn't read the details that it's a two piece.Too sheer of a fabrics to wear.It looks knitted in the picture and ol looking.If you want quality, you have to pay for it I suppose.Not the quality I was expecting.They're really not even close to the design or quality of the original Jordan lace locks.If only the fabric was less see through ( Oh well, live and learn.the material doesn't stay in place and i think if anything this is just good for posture.The latex top is not very mfortable around you middleFits very well, fabric not good quality, too thin can be seen through.I returned it, did no like quality for that price.The craftsmanship isn't great.Shrinkage with washing alsoThey are definitely beautiful.I will still wear them but I was expecting better quality.I workout and have lost of workout clothes these are for funky not good for working out whatsoever.The quality is OK I guess, but I'm not happy at allOk product, doesn't look too fancy.Leather, if you will, is low grade and already stretching.as other reviewer stated, the waist band has basically no elastic and it's like trying to pull closed jeans over the baby's hips each time you take them on and off.Not mfortable for the baby.But cute design if they uld make it more wearable.Nice heavy watch, keeps great time.I'm usually a medium and ordered myself a large I'm pregnant and the material/fabric was so see-thru and cheap.Ironically, I bought this for river tubing and surfing because I thought it looked sturdy and that it wouldn't fall downWould definitely keep the dress if the material was tton.Nice accessory piece, but the fabric sticks to EVERYTHING.The barbells are ok quality as far as how they look.This may just be personal sensitivity, but overall I'm not really impressed with this product and I don't remmend it.I sewed a band across the back to hold it together and on, but it still isn't really wearable.The quality is also not what I'd hoped.Plastic boards are best thing about this bag.Not a good value Not stichedvwell off centered and didn't want to snap shut with cigarette inside:'( Dissatisfied and disappointed specially for the price Not a good purchaseNo adjustable straps and to short.It was lightweight and cheap, but also super adorable.The glasses are pretty good for the price I have several pairs in different lors).In the photo it's big than you can see it....I suppose it would work fine on a bracelet?Good idea but the tips are extremely soft and bend easily.You can't tell once you wear it, but the ring is all warped.The wings are beautiful.Not impressed, looks cheap, does not fit very well, picture is much better than actual product.Not happy with the weird old lady cut.I'll keep the one that fits and cut off the heavy, heavy trimming they used on it.The material does not appear to be very sturdy and I have decided to order a leather product instead.The reason why i bought is because in the picture looks stylish.I loved the fabric but then I noticed that the right sleeve was not sewn.Double the price of the shoe.Not great quality, but I guess you get what you pay for.It's a cute non-maternity skirt so I am giving two stars.Better quality than I was expecting.Disappointed as they were marketed very good as breathable.It's doesn't drape elegantly and has no hopes of looking nice in any capacity.It is a cute top with a cute ncept.The material is ok and should last a few washes.The fabric at the top does not have enough elasticity to it to mfortably nurse.Not that great quality either.But it arrived full of dust that I assume was from manufacturing process) and smelled strongly.Much lighter than pictured.Also, this was a good price for extenders not so much for just .Quality like a third world sweat shopI am very surprised because Columbia normally has good quality clothing.Its good that i bought it as a gift for my beautiful petite mother in law.Lots of loose threads from lace.Watch looked ol but band was chipped in two place.Material not as stretchy as I hoped and was hoping for a better fit.It is a beautiful shirt and well made, but the sizing runs very small.Not the material I expected but great fit and very cuteDoesn't make you sweat at all waste of money but it's good for a tummy tuck.Didn't look That great on me.These earrings are well made but are very heavy.I don't feel that it's secure enough to wear out, yet, but when I do, I'm planning to put a spare necklace in my purseIt looked so cute and I read it was % tton so I trusted the quality will be good and after reading other reviews I decided to get it.The awesome rainbow finish rubbed off very quickly, any smudges show up very easily as well.Material is light and dress is short.I am looking for a better pair of lace up shoes.Don't think it uld stand up to frequent travel and nstant useWould work great if you are carrying larger items like books or electronics, etc.Adjustments do nothing and most pockets have no access.The pattern is quite nice the mesh is fairly durable.I won't give it star simply because i liked the designI will have to buy a slip in order to wear it.Stone was separated, not mounted on necklace.We glued it in place and now it looks good.Great pattern.The shorts have a stretchy waistband so they go on well.Feels like a yard house dressIt was cute, I loved it for the short time it last.Comfortable, just not as expected.Which is riciculousLoved the front but the back clingsPlus, the material is not very stylish.They look good in the picture but you can see everything you try to wear under them.I love the design and would have paid for it but the quality is sub-par.I guess another gift to my very slender sister.The chains are just ok. As usual, the photo is deceptive, this necklace is something one would wear poolside, chlorine and all.Maybe in jeans it would not be as noticeable of a deformed shape but in dresses and slacks it shows CLEARLY something ain't right.Looks nice for a cktail party ring.they look nice if I uld figure how to wear it.very plunging neckline.. too much emphasis on the chestWould be great for a ver up by pool etc.I love the design and the quality looks amazing but it is too thick for my nose.Not as elegant as it looks in the picture.I love the lor and I love the fit but if there is a stain in a mile vicinity it will find its way to this shirt and it doesn't me offOther than that it's good qualityNice fabric but it is a foot-longer than me.Pierced with needle from bottom up so I uld guide the ring threw right under the needle.Once at the top you may have issues getting the ring through the skin since you have to be quick as needle will be ming out.This is where you will wish the needle and ring was nnected as I did.Material is then but it is a Halloween stumeQuality is about what you would expect at this price.Good lanyard, nice quality and design.The printing was nice and the shape was nice.Bought this dress as a mother-of-the-bride dress for my daughter's beach side wedding ceremony.My work mostly entails sitting at a mputer all day, so it's a mystery to me how they got damaged.-stars because they won't last long if they fall apart just from sitting in them all day.I like the material, design, price, quality and overall product but I won't be fitting in the top anytime soon, the girls are going with standard trianglesso it's not super well made.I didn't care for the quality.Nice felt lining.This may have been because the shirts I was using may have not been the best material tton polyester blend for the clasp to stick but this is my experience.But they do look good.First the plus side: It's a cute picture and soft fabric.I expected better for the stNot sewed well.These totally fell apart.The flower design does not look as nice in the picture.The quality on what's expectedIt is mpletely see thru.other than that they're very warm and mfy.Aligator clips would have worked a lot better for my situation.It shrinks very easily and doesn't look good on.I bought it for a Europe vacation where we were moving around quite a bit and living out of our backpacks, thinking its lightweight, wick-away fabric would be good for a lot of walking/hiking.Definitely NOT made for your tragus, which is why I purchased it.From a few feet away in normal lighting it looks like an ordinary wedding ring, which would be a useful deception if it were the true Ring of Power.Material it light and stretchy, it is see through, the sizes run extremely small, still,happy with them though, just have to lose weightthe look nice and sturdy out of the box.Material different than expectedI know it is not expensive, but I still expected a quality product and did not receive that.Otherwise good qualityThat said, if you have access to a needle and a little thread of whatever lor you purchased, then it can be made to work and it is soft and pretty.Disappointed since the fabric is nice.The fabric was nice though, and the lor and pattern were true to the photo.This doesn't let the air move through it and it was extremely hot.It's pretty pattern, it's warm.Over priced for how loose they are.Only really good thing is that they are warmLast night I had to slather his legs in aquaphor just so he uld walk mfortably.Made of very high quality sewing with zipper end protectors, double fabric makes up the entire garment.Good quality elastic used for entire bra.The lours are very fresh and this bra uld be worn as a garment to exercise in or just look pretty in.Other hand love the look of them.Super cute if the snaps had stayed on.Slides down on my face.I bought the original when it came out last year, but after months the rose gold finished chipped away.Nice leather, but not worth price tag.Quality of hoodie is ok but the quality of the graphics is appalling.It literally feels like a home-made school project using an iron-on product you buy from the craft store.every other day my watch will fall off my wrist and i will need to screw the latch back in, it never really beming tight again.Soft and mfortable, but mpletely different from the style I ordered and uglier in my opinion) I ordered the pink dress with geo design and got this...I'm not happy with my purchase but I'll keep it.The width of the product is fine, if you're about '".She did not end up wearing it she sold it to a resale shop.In my opinion, it does not have the quality as a real leather.The lors and fit are accurate but the fabric is like a cross between a plastic table cloth and those capes you wear when you get your hair cut.In another fabric this would be really pretty.Where's the quality?It does have the adjustable strap but it's only for the sides They've fallen apart in less then months.The fit was nice though so I wish the fabric was better.They are certainly not polished and are not very substantial at all.This is not true tshirt material.The detail photos show the difference in fabric.I didn't like the fabricVery nice but the clip fell offThis looks gorgeous in the picture.They look good, but one off the pearls fell off alreadyVery cute but gloves didn't last ten minutes.I would have had to be about " shorter to tie the straps.Giving two stars because of two things, first the shirt itself is good quality.The send thing is that the printing seems like good quality too, awesomeI do not include the box necklaceI buy all kinds of cutout lingerie, and love mesh, as it is generally very flattering to my full figured body.It's cute for a very light weight over shirt for nights in the summer.looks nothing like the picture...material is all prom- ish from the 'sTHE MATERIAL IS NOT AS DESCRIBED.I loved the design it just need to be made with better materials.It's like hard cardboard or plastic with some smooth leatherette" fabric stretched over the frame.The base is also a light material.Arrived looking antiqued".Although these have Velcro straps if you tighten them you run out of Velcro.Not fabulously mfortable.I LOVED it and it fits great, but like many others are saying it is not the lor or lace design pictured and described.I love the design of this ring, unfortunately the bad definitely outweighs good.My daughters both do not like them because of how wide the shirts are.Love the bracelet.Breaks easily had purchased both and they both brokeIt's more pink and more of a faux silk material than chiffon, which made the pleating a less attractive.I'm kind of disappointed in the sewing of this product, for the price it was definitely worth it but I have to roll up the sleeves to make it look goodI'm very fussy and it just didn't live up to my expectation.not happy with materialQuality is great and the look is perfect.Quality seems cheap, love the ncept not thrilled with it.Beautiful rings but after an hr of trying to get the ball I gave upIt holds a lot, but I wish my keys and phone would fit at the same time.Material is like a pair of hanes.Aside from the design, I did not care for this item.It smells like machine oil when received.Marks too easily.Neckline isn't very flattering.I received this with no lace...i love the lace and i wish it went all the way around to mplete the look.This ear derations look very ol.Knockoffs, skimpy at topIt was also not the same fabric as the shapers I've used in the past.Not sure if it would be as mfortable or durable even if they did fit.Works if you're six feet tall.I loved the necklace.It's just as pictured and beautiful upon receipt.It is now mpletely tarnished just from sitting so much so that the metal on charm no longer matches the chain.Really disappointed with the quality on such a beautiful necklace.The style is great but it's very thin and it didn't wash well the very first time we washed it.material is see through.No enough booby supportIt's a thin verup/dress, and the design isn't high quality, but it will last a summer or even two with care.These are NOT the Top Gun glasses.It doesn't look as nice as it does in the picture.Also, the shade of nude is not ethnically versatile.It was not easy to use or maneuver.I have nothing to hide and it seriously makes me look pregnant bc it poofs out below the waist belt.But it's not the dress in the stock photo.They were great for a few weeks.The style and the fit are great, but the fabric is WAY too thin; you can see through it when you bend over and it's stretched out a bit.Quality not as expectedOnly was able to enjoy them for a few days:(What initially looked to be a fashionable slouch tunic" with belting possibilities, fell far short of my creative visions.Very delicate, material is not pure.It was no easy to adjust.Nice material quality.The leather end pieces are shaped flat which will not allow them to be fastened to the trouser buttons without creating an unmfortable bunching at each button position.I bought many pairs of these because I thought I'd stumbled upon a great product.There are much better travel socks out there that won't cause such a headache.It looks like silky underwear; not a bathing suit bottom.The outfit fit very well but the back button popped while i was on the dance floor and ruined my whole night making by bday weekend short livedThe shoe is beautiful thoughI'll give it the two stars for the cute pattern and the fact that it's isn't as see through as I expected it to be when I took it out of the package.Not happy with the quality of the material.I needed these socks for a stume and honestly these were pretty chintzy lace trimmed socks.However, for the price and one time wear, it was fine.the quality isn't all that great.The material is like a nylon stretchy material and the pattern just doesn't sit right on me '").Had no paper work for return if did not fit or proof of purchaseThe picture make it look bigger than what it is and then make the details in the charm look more defined but in person it's notThe fabric is listed as chiffon but that is not a fabric ntent.Chiffon is a style of weaving like twill or basket weave.The print is gorgeous and the quality of the dress is fine.I washed it with ld water and fabric softener but it didn't soften it.These would probably be great for the taller, more toned ladies out there.The print on this T-shirt was very substandard and looks much better in the ad pictureExpected it to be fullerThis was not well made at all.It looks ol, especially if you're in shape, but I wouldn't remmend it for its functionality.. Firstly, it's not warm at all, a slight breeze whips right through it.the fabric is good and the brim is as shown, but the crown is really too high to be worn mfortably at least by me.about a half inch of chain links were messed up so can not wear it Pendant is lovely just the sameMaterial is soft and mfortable....but too big.It created a hole that was not repairable by hand without creating awkward puckering.Its pure rayon and its not long at all.Pattern is nice looking though.These are beautiful and appear to be great quality, but are too big for me.Looks cute online but the quality wasn't the best.Material felt nice and a little stretchy, but the way the sleeves looked once I tried it was not as flowy and nice as shown or expected.The pictures are not the same product I received.Otherwise the quality is good.The loring and details were nice though.THE MATERIAL WAS VERY COMFORTABLE, BUT THE TOP WAS JUST TOO SHORT.Ended up taking it apart, cutting some length off of the longer strap, and reassembling.Not really worth the price for the quality, in my opinion.Tee shirt is mfortable.It is not mfortableIn all fairness the wool fabric they used is ok.Great Idea that needs to be seriously re thought before it is produced.love the cut...This added to the st of the shirt.It's a beautiful design and soft, flowy fabric.The fit and mfort are normal and good feel of any tton shirt.nice material but way too long for my liking, going to have to alter the length.good price for a shirt though.....Definition ideal for thin girls without curves.They are only good for around the house as the fabric is super thin.Otherwise it was great.Not a great design, especially for kids who are learning to tell time.Quality wasn't as expected but ok for casual wear...The ear flaps stuck out some distance from my ears, and were very long, so would not have kept my ears warm.Was not happy with quality of item.Seem cheap n light weight was questioning if ring was real.Especially clothing.It's cream.Was not satisfied stones were fallen and was not happy at allThey are still usable but not a great quality product by any means.First in Foremost, it was loose on me okay.I love this beltThe one flaw is the little thingy that goes in the belt hole, well it is sharp and Scratches the belt buckle ALL over the placeIt's a really cute belt buckle tooLooks good, very far awaySwing and a miss.Made in China, very inexpensive, so didn't mind the risk.Not exactly flowy and loose like the pictureI was hopefully for it to be flowy, but it seems to cling onto me in places that weren't flattering.You uld see the padding and uldn't wear a Bra.The watchband is broken, would like a replacement pkeaseNot Warm at all.The outside of the wallet feels nice.Beautiful Jacket.wonderful detail.Didn't realize it was a crop top".Thought it gave off the idea it would ver your belly.Beautiful skirt.zippers don't work very wellNo support in the top.Made of nice t shirt material?Comfortable, but really-- they are not mpressive enough.Great for price though and super cuteThis product I did not care for.I didn't expect much, as the price is nice, as far as Blazers go, but it looked cheaper than I expected.The price was great, but I'm not sure I will even wear them.It's cute and will work for what I wanted it for.This sweater is not sewed very well.And loose strings are all over the sweater.The material is fine and they'll work as an undershirt but they definitely not what I expected.These are okay, not really what I thought they would be as far as the material.It's not the real ones so they don't stay on too well.rather itch and not rabbit fur or rabbit fur blend.They are very long and stretch but not warm.Quality isn't there for the price.The material is also a little thin, but soft and slinky.Love this pattern.Missing all of the accessories that claim to be included, not a huge deal just wanted what I paid for).These leggings would certainly have been warm, but they were just too tight to be mfortable.Very first impression once received is how incredibly soft and stretchy the material is.The material doesn't feel nstricting and breathable, especially on a very hot day.This extra material shoved up into your crevices quickly beme unmfortable but you think you can get over it with how great and soft the fabric is.If I were you, stick to your cheaper fruit of the looms and be more mfortable.The package lists a tton-spandex blend.The socks themselves fit nicely, however, I would have purchased a different brand had they been described properly on the product description.Hat is of nice quality but would fit a month old...not leatherPlanty of room.Wish it was more moisture proofI found that everything inside was damp or wet.This purse was lovely and seemed well-made.They didn't really give me any support and the silin area was much too high for where my incision was made.Remmend look closely at neckline,,,just not for me,,,too wide for my taste on top.Clearly not very sturdy.Iron on decal.Has a lot of room and great organization.These bras are mfy and easy to use for nursing, the problem I have with these are that all unraveled within weeks.These were too thick for my earring holes.Good quality tho.Paper lining that vers the exterior isn't easy to remove.Material is nice but I'm disappointed.was not happy with the design.Loved the look of the shirt and the quality, but they sent me not only the wrong size but the wrong lor as well and when I tried to order it again rrectly they were out of stock.The diamonds" are too prominent.Reminds me of my great grandmother's stume jewelry.I'm slow and gentle to remove them off too I'm not trying to stretch my skin but its super sticky so I think I'll reserve these for special occasions only.They're mfortable, stretchy and they look good.Incredible cheap nstruction.The tiniest ear cuff I've ever bought.However, it cannot stand up to the wear and tear of daily use.It's tton, which is cheaper than synthetics or wool, bit you loose certain features such as warmth if you get wet from snow, rain, or sweat).I prefer a two piece thermal this hasn't me untucked on me yet.But this fails to trap air keep it warm against your body.Conclusion if you want a little something extra in ol not ld) temps, this is ok for the price.But my suggestion is to save your money invest in a much higher quality set of thermals.The material is nice and soft.The stitching is of good quality.This item receives stars instead of star because the material is really soft and the stitching is good quality.It has a great feminine neckline.. and nicer than most unisex" athletic style raglan shirts.It does not look as good as it does in the pictureIf you want a cheap pair of glasses that you don't have to worry about banging up, these are NOT the right choice.I really liked the style when these arrived, and in fact that is the only reason I am giving it an extra star.I terms of quality, yes, I know they are glasses; nonetheless I did expect them to last more than day.Soft and cuddly, but they unraveled with a large hole in just a few days.The dress is a cheaper quality than the picture which is expected.Plus I thought there would be a little more tton so a little more air would get through.This is my least favorite.Quality wasn't as expected and it was too big.& the material was weird not soft like I expected it was like stume material.gorgeous and the silver really held upThe crochet in the middle was nice thoughGold shiny scales is not accurate.The chin strap/rd was perfect for keeping the hat from blowing away.it is mpletely see through.Not a mfortable material.The fabric is funky.Looks better in pictures.Too big for a fake nose ring.... that was the only reason I wanted itOkay but not such good quality.It did seem to have quality material and good stitching, so I'm sorry I uldn't wear it.I'm being generous giving it two stars simply because the top is still functional and I'm able to wear it with different bottoms.Just because they are inexpensive doesn't always make it a good purchase.Glasses seem okay though.The leather is a bonded product, vered in polyurethane.Any review that suggests otherwise does not have a realistic frame of reference for what a quality leather belt is.Could be cheaper and do not feel the aloe like other infused socksI will wear it under other things for warmth, but I certainly wouldn't wear it by itself.This isn't ideal for traveling, at best it's an overnight bag.The designs are very interesting and I like the style, also I like the fact that most of the items are made of tton.The idea is awesome, but it was so obviously cut out and ironed on, it was aweful These sunglasses are flexible in the arms that me off the temple and behind the ear but honestly, that's not where they need to be flexible.Received on the day she had to wear it and it was to large and too short, length worked but had to pin down both sides to get it to fit.Not as sparkly as I expectedBut overall the quality of the material was good.While they are soft and mfy at first there are a uple problems.It's a gorgeous ring, shame it'd not better quality.Great material but to big for the pocket, of it was a lil smaller it would be awesome.The style looked good though and if it was tton, would have fit nicely.Because of the material, the shirt was always riding up.Material is very synthetic also, almost certainly made in China.The gold makes them look like toy sunglasses.They look great but the lenses are hazy and the lack of a nose piece affects you wearing it.Honestly, I don't care for the quality of this product.This wallet is very stylish.It should be posted as stume use only and not suitable for pool use.Pretty little stones.The earring itself is cute but the earring doesn't want to stay in my ear.It doesn't work for me I put it on from the moment I wake up which is am all the way to pm and it does not work.They're cheaper and works betterPlastic feeling material, if you are top heavy do not get this it will not fitAnyway, I found a way to make them work.Not painted very good.Shirt doesn't look good.The glasses are worth but you spend more, not worth it.Overall the suit fit ok and it did it's job but the quality uld definitely be better for the price.I am sure it would have been a good product.However, it would be better if it had an elastic waist band.The shirt is made of excellent material.Good quality fabric but the printed image is very dark and blurry like low resolution... not enough pixels or something).I sleep in them and they ride up, thus giving no protection.As soon as I open package there was a odd smell, don't know if it was the material but smell was too strong for me.I got neutral prints and the rest were girlie.The fabric quality was good for a at of this price.A few loose threads in the seams but nothing that uldn't be trimmed and everything appeared that it was sewn well, just not trimmed off.I have to tie the blue straps that are under the striped straps in a knot because they are so long.Don't buy this if you don't have a great slip to wear under it.Sad thing is this is a beautiful, well-nstructed bra.I like the fabric, I was surprised it was nice and warm and decent quality for the price.Not as mfy as wanted.I thought it was only the packaging so I thought I would let it air out.The patten is cute which is why I kept it but they need to seriously look at their quality ntrol.The jersey fabric is nice but it doesn't fit wellA vest, a tie, a bow tie and a hankie for under ... Should have known it would not be the quality we were looking for.However, if you need a vest for a single occasion and don't mind rather stiff fabric this is an incredible deal.This is not denim in the true sense of the word I don't know that to call it).It is certainly not the denim one gets in jeans and other denim shirts.Love, but quickly start to loose proper function.The shirt has a nice design but it was too thin.It would be nice if they had a bigger handle and zipped up to close and keep things secureSo I had to sew them on to be stronger.There may be a thin layer of leather there somewhere, but this puppy is primarily rubber-like material.Good idea, just needs a bit more work.Also, it is sewn practically straight almost like a pencil skirt) with little room to extend a leg forward because material is also taunt.Its a beautiful sweater and im sure if it fitted me it wind be great but i ordered a plus size x and it doesn't fitIt is not bulky and does retain body heat well for a fabric that isn't fleece.Nothing that can't be fixed, and I still wear this, and it is totes mfy, but for , I expect better quality so I have to change my stars to (Not % tton, but soft enough.beautiful in the picture.And strings hanging everywhereIt's a good was it trainer but I'm giving to star because it's too small and the hooks were tornOn the bright side, the fabric and cut are nice.In fact, I'd say these are a high quality pair of super soft undies.We received the dragon and the octopus shown, but not the yeti, ocean scene, or fish.Material is kind of itchy as well and it's very fittedFeels good on the wrist.Nice fabric and design.I'd give more stars but one of the bras arrived with a broken clasp However, the fit was good and the bras are mfortable.They look ol, but won't stay on my face.Doesn't look good on.Nice material and print, cute bow but L fits like a S/XS and is pretty short in lengthI used these to derate my cubical.Zippers don't work easily.The top is beautiful and decent quality but sizing was way off.It has a nice theme of the inner dial ticket and rotating but for a few more bucks, they uld've reinforced the glass dialThe material is polyester, which I hadn't realized when I ordered.All of that said, once I buy different buttons and iron it out it will be wearable the seaming and cut is flattering.A novelty gift for a relative.Too many wires and bulbs.This is super soft tton, which is great Not so great is its not the product shown in the picture If you like a Soft tton with print then this is for you Bifocal line is too high and fairly visible.Inexpensive looking when on.The outside material feels good enough, and the overall bag is simple, clean looking.For my use, I'll look for a wider travel bag with stronger mesh, so I can pack more products and be able to close the bag nicely.The quality seems fine but the puffiness is a problem.First it is not yellow, it is mustard fine I can accept that.I wish they were sold as separates.Very heavy and seems to be well made.very chinzy materialThey WERE awesome up until the plastic lor ating wore off just after one day of wear.But as for the regular silver tone rings, they still work well and are mfortable enough.Liked the quality and fabric.The fit is fine, the rise is good, but the fabric isn't what I ordered.Material is nice though and is well stiched.That said, it is very mfortable and hides the stomach area quite well.If you have thick, full hair, this product is not for you.I am not pleased with this item.Arrived fine but does not look as picture shows.I bought this shirt thinking it would fit like in the picture definitely not.I did not like the qualityNice looking but order with careAnd the emblem on the front is not attractive.It is somewhat warm, so instead of sending it back, I will keep it.This is my send purchase of the Lace Effects" edition.This bra is super mfy like all of the other reviews mentioned.The reason I only it stars is that I've had it for less than months and the seams are already ripping and it will need to be replaced.Material is cheap, picks up all kinds of debris-dog hair in my case, and it is NOT breathable.Not warm at all.They said it is waterproof and the water runs out It does NOT hold up to the rainThe straps just aren't long enough, and there isn't anyway to sew them to make them longer.can't wear it for long periods of time without feeling the effects.The toy itself is nice but if you cannot get the plastic thingy open to put the batteries in, not worth the price.Bottoms fit nicely but top is just a long pieces of stretchy material.I have purchased French Toast brand in the past but this definitely was not the same quality shirt that I bought through other retailers.I liked the look very muchbetter packaging and better product quality would have been a plusPants was a bit to big but the top fit perfect.they can improve on the material of the pants.cheap quality of denim.Nice fabric but sizing way offLooks deceptive in the photo, as to me it looks more flowy>The photo of the at is enticing but upon delivery all you get is a bait and switch.Picture wasn't very well definedMy only ncern is their quality.Gloves were thin and not as warm as we would like, got them for my son for sking, returned these and we ordered a different pair from you, hoping they are warmerSend, it is pretty see through, which is okay.Especially when wetThe sewing wasn't great.These are not suitable for public use.I loved the quality, and look of it, however it was too small for my wrist...It was not hot enough for him to start sweating and overall the kids liked it.The divots in the ball are so shallow it makes it very hard to get and keep lined up for enough tension to keep it in place.It's a nice material, and very warm, though, which is the only reason I gave it two stars.Item has extended panels in front that went out so style.It looked better on the model.It needs to be taken in and given a little more shape.Beautiful earrings, this is my send time purchasing them.The clasps don't last long and they aren't secured to your ears.This necklace is really cute, and the price was wonderful.Material is okay, and the blue is nice.And they do seem to be wearing out quicker than the other set of Fila socks he hasIt looks Like send quality.Design on shirt flakes off very easy.I suggest waist trainer with velcro no wire.beautiful, but it broke after uses--I question the quality, but the style is fabulousIt looks better on the model then in real life.I will be returning it because it just didn't look good on me.It's was right every where but the chest.This is a very flexible lace.Some Jewels fell out and shipping but will be easy to repair.Belts on dress was not like seen in picture and the placement of the pattern of jewels was a little off.No very sturdy.Other then that great material not see through.Hand to number off alignmentThe fabric is soft, but not stretchy.it was beautiful but it came teardCute design but I wouldn't purchase one again.While attractive, this evening purse does not function.Stretches out easily.They don't look as nice as in the picture and are closer to fishnet than lace.However, for the price...these might be great for just a night out.The stitching was fine, but I know it would never be able to hold any kind of weight.I have had it sitting in the garage hoping the smell will dissipate, but so far that's not been my experience.I don't feel mfortable my hands in the mittens.They without doubt are warm, but it's hard to make a fist with hands in them.Not at all chiffon-like.not to happy over al look of beadsStyle is fine, quality not so much I suggest trying a different brand.The product is beautiful.All of these bags looked very promising when I first saw them, however, the quality is not very good in my opinion and does not meet the expectations I had in mind.I like the lors but this too is rather picky from the wire it is made withIt's a very nice top.great product"Topaz simulated diamond k gold filled" with a picture of a blue center stone.The center stone MAY in fact be topaz; I am not qualified to call that one, but it certainly isn't the lor shown in the pictures.It is very nicely cut for a piece in this price range, and shows some lor refraction in daylight.That would have been a reasonable material to make a ring like this out of.They uld have used cupronickel inside, which would have been better as the plating wore off so as not to be so obvious.NEVER wear this ring to the beach or in any environment where it will be exposed to abrasives.The ring is bright and looks and feels much more solid than your average stume jewellery.I have a stainless steel ring on order to wear to work, since this one DEFINITELY won't last long at a machine shop, but it will be a fabulous weekend ring.I have the Saxx Kinetic underwear and I love them.fits ok..but the lining just cut into the foot and at the end of the day a lot less mfortable than other no-show socks ive bought.Kudos to being very soft and fluffy though.I wanted to love them, but the cinchy waistband and cut of the pants just didn't work for me.They also don't have that mfy wear-all-the-time vibe like overalls should have.They were kind of formal feeling.Too large to wear in public, but very mfortable to wear around the houseMaterial and stitching appears good.Does not look as good as it on the picture...I found other products that were less expensive and the fabrics were nice and softer.Lights don't workWhen I received this vest, I expected a more structured fabric to support the structured cut of the garment, especially since it is unlined.Sadly, the fabric is a bit more fluid than it needs to be and doesn't provide enough body to support the structure of the vest.Falling apart after only weeks of minimal use.This would make a great wallet for a child or teenager, not a grown man with the same interests as a child or teenager.It was too wide for my husband's finger, making it awkward and unmfortable for him to wear.Doesn't look that great; a child might like it?Sandals were not mfortable.TAKE NOTE: These socks are handwash onlyHandwash.The dress itself was beautifulThe material was very nice.This dress is just not well made.But my shoulders???The shirt fit and was OK quality.The leather was good quality as was the workmanship.Sims to be good quality too.If it weren't such an innvenience, I'd exchange it.Most definitely not suede, however, they are still very cute.It may work with or layers of the same pettiat, but who wants to put that many layers on a child?I did not care for this shirt.The material is ridiculously thick.Stone was outNot well described, I thought the metal was Gold lor but was Silver, the only Gold detail is the arch inside the resin.The resin look cheap and all irregular, the rubi look cheap and flat not sparkly, I returning this item, it doesn't go well with the fancy bags I wear...The jacket is nice but my daughter can't even wear itThere is no ribbon in the front of the outfit they shipped to me.It's just a fairly cheap watch in material though beautiful when functional) but in this case it'll st you in the end to have something this low of qualityArms were a little itchy, bow and arm warmers were not included as described and it was pretty pricey.Nice size but all the stitching was loose and ming apart after a few days...Pros: The band is mfortable, if a bit thick.They are beautiful, because of my medical nditions I need to carry a big bag.I happily clipped the strap on.Its useable, but not very mfortable, and pretty dang warped.It is pretty, but, I am not mfortable with the fit.It is also gauzy see-thru).These gloves are not ridged" enough and they are not what I expected.I don't do fuzzyIt had a strong odor upon arrival, but it's fine after washing.Update: This gown just didn't work for me.The body of the shirt for fine...On the plus side, this is very soft and can also be worn as a scarf.Aesthetically pleasing, and the materials seem to be pretty good quality.it looks better in the picNot nstructed well.This skirt is super soft, fit good, but material is very thin.I didn't get the lip rings in the package..Sure, they're extremely cheap, and everyone loves that.At first I thought some may be defects, but I promise you, put them in alhol and they are done for.I can't get the hang of it it's just not mfortable or natural for me, and it feels too tight around the hips.I wore the shirt stays" for a uple of weeks and they worked as described when it mes to functionality.I can no longer use the product.Not very good quality looks better in the pictureThe sweater is cute but not great quality.I just washed it and I'm hoping it lasts through this winter.The necklace chain is long which is wonderful cept I ordered for /th old girls.)Not a very mfortable bracelet.Fabric is super soft but the top fit more like a crop top.For the st of this I expected it to have decent details.The dress itself is cute and okay quality for the price.Material not as I expected.The shoe was mfortable to the point of not even thinking about the fit.The material seems to be pretty good quality and it's super cute but I uld barely pull it up over my hips and when I did it was so short on meThe material is nice and light, and the embroidery is pretty.Was not impressed at all with the quality of this swimsuit.Definitely not made for anyone with curves.Once your dress it it is actually cute but I was expecting it was a better quality for other similar priced vintage dressesToo pricey for the quality.They look good and are mfortable.The materialOrder the more expensive rings, it's worth it.This skirt looks much cheaper in quality than in the picture....Was not aware that this dress was a mesh dress.To me it's more suitable as a beach wearKind of heavy as well for nipple piercings.Not much support to the top...Looked cute, but if I moved... it didn't work for me.Mmmmm.... not very good qualilty.Not made very wellFound them to be very heavy with no staying power.They stick, but don't look as good as the siline petals.You can see an outline under shirt and not real mfortable to wear for long periods of time.Prettier in photo.Not so good quality the bow came right off, you get what you pay for.the material is ol thoughDidn't like feel or look of leather.It doesn't support it mfortable.I'm giving this two stars because fit aside, I am please with the quality of the product for the price.The design was beautiful, but I would never wear something so tight and sheer.Nice material and style.But the material is not true neoprene it is definitely cheaper feeling.Flame design looks great.The material is unattractive and fits larger than looks flattering.The materials, although of poor quality still do look accurate to the Amazon picture.Only one shoe charges, therefore the lights only work on one sneaker.I don't care for the material.Have not worn it.The lor was beautiful and it seemed to be of good quality, but it was much shorter than expected.Very mfortable.I guess you get what you pay for and since this jewelry is so cheap, maybe I should have had lower expectations.Very long I am ' and it hit my knee so the model in the picture must be a giant).This is not really a long necklace.not well madefabric is soft,thin and clingy.I had high hopes for these bras, they were the only ones she found mfortable.If you are purchasing this item in hopes that it will give you a nice butt lift, DO NOT BUY ITThese are ochie cutters ...But the fabric was nice and soft.cinch rd end holder does not keep rd in as it should, good thing for gorilla glue.I only walked on paved surfaces.It is a beautiful dress but the lace for the back was missingLove the style .. but very thin and not make very well.The metal fringe are falling off Lost six so far I rated this a two because of the leather but I would not remmend this purse.The fabric is a s style poly blend that I am quite sure will both winkle easily and be filled with static cling.The lor is lovely, but the fabric neither feels soft nor looks flowy up close.Not that happy with the jacket.Quality seemed to be there, but can't really mment as it's going right back to Amazon.poor quality fabric, not elastic, but beautiful patternFeel lightweight as well.Edges are relatively sharp and should have been more polished and rounded.All that aside, they do look cute would have been cuter if I did not have to stretch them to fit) and the material feels nice.Quality and design are nice, a bit nylon feeling, but there are buttons on the sleeves that are a nice detail.Really well stitched.Not soft fabric like I thought.The derative pattern that's on the top mes down very low, so a cami is needed so that your under garment won't show.I will not buy this top again and I would suggest you go out and buy a better quality blouse.The top itself is fine but the bra is to big.That being said the design of the hat is ol and nstruction is also good.The skirt is pretty, the top is see through.So I don't wear as often as I would want to.The pictures make these seems very classy and gorgeous, and almost like a real jewel.I would've been perfectly OK with the cheap appearance of the materials had I received the three rings specified, and all of the products worked rrectly/ without default.Looks beautiful in the picture.I have to return it and the robe, which is too bad because I really did like the pattern and the quality otherwise seems fine.Sadly returning them even though the dark grey lens purple marbled frame is very attractive just not on my face.Nice quality ordered x fits like and LNot very supportive in the top.This is not sturdy.The lour is not good its like washable and fades easily.It looked very nice, but it breaks and rips very easy.The material is nice, but this is GIANTCan't Stand the materialThe pockets, the reason I bought this, were too fragile.The earrings are slightly better, although there is still a small defect in one of the flower petals.The top was NOT supportive in the bra area.If you want long great shirt.This is a great quantity for such a good price but there is a reason for that.Every single day the little diamond" falls out and it needs to be replaced.The other problem I have with these bras is the zipper.They have a piece of the soft fabric placed nicely to protect you from the bottom of the zipper and that lays over the top of the zipper as well, which is a nice touch.The lors are great, the fabric is mfortable and no itchy' spots.Simple.It was cute but no where close to fitting me.THE FABRIC WAS NICE AND HEAVY THOUGH.The picture does not show the tiny rope so I feel a bit duped, since this what the Chinese knockoffs all have.I love the different designs...The flexible design is nice...Comfortable, but definitely not much warmer than regular socks.Returned, Not great qualityAll of my previous current robes from Soft Surroundings are inches hit the top of my feet with a little extra to spare.It's very thin probably would serve ok as a Spring Summer robe.I'm fairly certain there uldn't be a whiff of it on the robe but don't want to take the chance.They are not very sturdy.Made well.Great to look at until I put it on.It feels like a straight jacket.Will not be rainproof.Well .. you need the body" to wear this.The top has no support at all.I was going to wear them as added support for when I work out.The chain is heavier, larger, longer and cheaper than it looks in the photos.The dress it's self is very pretty.This top was much baggier in real life than in the picture.The other shoe works well.This is a gorgeous ring but very low quality.The setting does not hold the stone in place well.and the hidden inside zipper came off the track immediately not a fabulous productThe quality is basic and matches the price that was paid.I'm not sure how it is measured but I can't wear it.Cute top, fit well, very mfy, but it got a hole in the armpit the first wear, not quality at allDid not look very good.Not made very well.Looks much better in the picture...Bubbled surface.It is not high quality and under the arms is too loose.Of the I bought, this was the best fitting.The black one is a different fabric than the gray one and doesn't fit nearly as nice.I need to replace the purse and want something more durable.The product quality is greatLooks like a solid piece but there is no explanation on how to exchange bezels.It's ok for what it is and great if you're just lounging around your home in the summer, but this totally fails when it mes to sizing, quality, and style.The style looked pretty good to me but I didn't like the gold necklace thingy hanging from the topit's a nice big sized bag but the white interior and the quality of the stitching make it look very cheap.The at itself is pretty.The lace' edging is more like a soft fringe.very very beautiful but the cut across the shoulders is not proportionate with the cut of the rest of the blouse.Quality is decent, prolly up to par with most similar products.I liked the material and love the pink.they look so much better in the picturesNot what I expected in the grade of the leather.I thought it would be the same lovely tton blend as my other Allegra K purchases, but it is all polyester.USUALLY X IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND THIS SHIRT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE.I resorted to hemming and trimming the sleeves off, and it looks so much betterThe ball was so easily unscrewed that I lost it within a week or wearing it.Makes mfy underwear for bed but cannot be used as a swimsuitI am disappointed it did not fit as it is a beautiful bra.Very sparklyThe earrings are very cute.It does its job and the soft material inside is very mfortble.Very hard to clean without damaging lights or remote.It was scratchy, and I uldn't last longer than one minute in this shirt before wanting to take it off.The material and quality are very nice.I hung the bag up to air out AND sprayed it with fabric refresher.Beautiful dress, very detail, and somewhat heavy.The material is very soft and mfy.this is an expensive watch but my dogs chewed up my original and its hard to find a original replacement and I want a metal band anyway.Perfectnot that cute in person.Item was well made, but obviously oriental sizing.Fabric is very nice but if you don't have the perfect butt, don't bother.They say cashmere in the TITLE of these, but they feel like acrylic and the label is in mandarin.They're soft but if cashmere, % at mostDollar store qualityThe gold plating" looks more like stume jewelry purchased out of a quarter machine.they were inexpensive but I would not buy this product again.I'm sure it's fine for casual wear, but it doesn't feel like a good, breathable fabric for summertime.The earrings themselves are beautiful.It is stretchy, but definitely not something you want to be tight on you.The hoodie, itself, is made from a cheap material and doesn't look very nice, plus there were strings left hanging all over it that I am having to cut off.It looks far more impressive in the picture than it really is.I bought the shirt for a party and was looking for a Chiffon dressy shirt.Material is nice just seems to be designed for a very very petite womanNot the soft fleece material I was hoping for.The belt had potential as it looks decent enough.Did not like the Material it was made out of..The quality and lor are nice though.First and foremost they arrived with a very strong chemical smell.I wanted loose and mfy it is tight and a bit scratchy.It's a beautiful ncept, but the fabric is much too thin, the dye dislors when any form of water touches it.My back pocket ripped my first day wearing them, they look really nice but the size and material are not good.quality is OKFor the price, you can find similar tops made of better quality in Target and Oldnavy.I had it in a safety net bag.I thought it was going to be less shiny.THE COLOR WAS FINE AND THE LACE WAS ATTRACTIVE, BUT THE DESIGN OF THE BODICE, ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO THE STYLE OF THE SHOULDERS WAS NOT APPEALING TO ME.Would have been perfect, but the larger set of studs was missing a jewel.Design is the only positive.Faux fur was going in every directionThe bottom hurts you actually feel the beading..Idk who thought that would be mfortable.Do love the necklace.The quality appears to be fine, but the shoe will not stay on while walking.The space is great, however, the wrist strap mpletely broke in less than a month of owning this.Fabric is decent quality for the price.I placed shirts and slacks in the bag for a business trip.Materials is not soft.Product is not as expected.Wires and battery pack a little bit of a challenge....These ear muffs d o keep ears insulated from the ld, however the inner surface should have been much more padded because ears hurt from the pressure, and the reindeer motif pegs them as a Christmas season item.My opinion is based off of how I feel about them, not off of the quality of the underwear itself.The material is sturdy and the stitching is good.Sorry, but tastes are different.This is just a personal perferanceIt is stunning, though.Beautiful patterned dress, but the neckline is extremely low cut really not wearable.The quality of the blouse is good, and it is as beautiful as the picture.There was nothing wrong with them physically wrong with them The socks look good, fit great, and are very mfortable.That disappointment/frusration aside, it is a soft mfortable fabric.I have to wear a camisole under it because the arm holes are very large but someone with more curves might not need to.It is a nice looking watch, but the leather is very stiff.Comfortable to wear at home and looks cute with a tunic.I own several Mountain Made products and love them.I ordered these with high hopes.... Don't get me wrong, these are beautiful earrings, but I uld not wear them.They would not stay attached.This was equal for both earrings.the outside still looks decent despite having a water stain and a splitting zipper.It's also well made, seems very durable yet soft.It uld be better if it came in black with organic dyes) and if the nose bridge cushioning was thick enough to block all light and get the mask off of the eyes enough so they can breathe.But the quality of the fabric and everything is good.Not happy with item Until I find a better quality safety money belt for my husband, this will do for now.Cool looking at first, but the inseam on the bill is not stitched and falls down often.However, it was a cute ncept and was inexpensive.I don't like quality of this product for the price.Fabric was decent but this definitely was not a turtle neck.Didn't make it a year before the zipper gave up.(Sad trombone) Not best for daily use.Stitching all seems to be holding up well.It does rest well on my back doesn't sit on my tailbone).It has LOTS of lovely pockets.But some canvas and seam spray seal would help that.It's a good fit but I'm a little set back on the fact that the material is very see thru.Be careful with the zipper as well.Giving two stars b/c of the pretty design on the picture.Didn't liked the fabric.I loved the way these earrings looked.Otherwise it's quite soft.The way this hangs is not attractive.Not flexible what so ever, does not bend at all, does not rest well on the neck.Padding is not realistic and shows through clothing.Difficult to tie it so that it looks good.You'd think this is of a higher biuld quality.The fabric gets baggy fast though and is not as mfortable as I was hoping.This dress arrived with the seams not sewn rrectlyMind you I wear a D.The dress isn't long as pictured but good quality.They look great.Some people don't mind polyester but I really am not a fan.If you need a dress for a dance class this might be perfect.Quality I was expecting but not the shape I ordered.It looked more elegant in the picture.Great quality though and if they were bigger I would give them stars.I love that they have the individual fingers and they're super soft.The material was soft and flowing like the picture shows.The material is nice, but the shape of the shirt is not like the photo.I did try it on with the nude lored strap that it came with and it seems quite mfortable and supportive.Love the designs on the fabric but the proportions are off.But if you want to train your waist or wear it working out, buy a more expensive brand.I do not know that any amount of stretching these out will make them mfortable, and I'm super bummed about it.Quality not as expected, but fine for casual wear....These are beautiful, strong metal non-piercing nipple rings.It was perfect for what I was looking for.The straps aren't adjustable, makes it a little difficult to put on and afraid they will snap.It's clingy in the right spots.The material is thin, but that's good in the spring and fall.This blouse is quite long on me I'm '" and I can easily pull it down below my hip) and I prefer that.In sum, I love how cute this blouse is, but it's kind of a disaster in every other respect.the product description is not accurate to understand what you will receive.The fabric seems nice and warm thoughThe lighting was great though Worked great on my infant.It wasn't unusable, but definitely not as supportive as a sport suit should be actually not supportive at all).I wear it when I go to the store or when I don't care how I look.Very very firm.well it was DEFINITELY fitted ) kind of cute, but just too short for work and not the best material for a professional business look.I am ', so it was a perfect length, if only the quality of this was a bit better.Thank goodness I was refunded, otherwise I would have used this for dusting my furniture that's how thin it was.I just wish the top pika dot blouse was longer.It's absolutely beautiful and I loved it.Looks to be well made, but it is short and very tight.This band looks nice, but is not worth it if it's going to fall to pieces.I do like the shirt, I just think that it is way over priced for the quality.The feel is very light, and very synthetic.It was vered in a white powder I had to clean off.To many sharp edges, doesn't open very easily and only has slots.I had on spanx and a waist clincher so I thought it would fit better.I fell in love with this based on the funnel neck look.The material and appearance is nice I guess but doesnt matter if all I can do is admire it there in the underwear drawer.Back of the dress is beautiful the front is not as pictured.Washes well.But the seam that nnects the under layer to the top shows through.I'm picky and it doesn't look right.Style was okay, but overall quality wasn't exactly as expected.Beautiful on the model.Bottom part is VERY SHEER(yes you can see through it) Top part is beautiful, but made too smallAlso, after trying it on the quality was not what I have expected.Plus, there's little-to-no give to the material at all.Because not only are they cute, the bow's unobtrusive and material pretty mfortable.Looked great and was mfortable but broke within a week.The play ground at her school has mulch under the equipment.This at looked great in the picture, but when it arrived, and I tried it on, it wasn't flattering to my frame AT ALL.I love the idea of this suite, but it's too thin, so I gave it to my friend for her and her husband's on their boat.Works well for straight post earrings, but very difficult to use with hook styles.ScratchyColor not as expected and more like polyester than chiffon.Too short and the bottom is loose not good quality nor design- not formingDefinately warm but just doesn;t stay in place.Fabric left over at top after I put it on and there is not enough cup verage at the top.Feels like craft feltThe lor is not true to the picture poorly man lights work wouldn't buy it again or remmend it.But remember that you pay what you get for, so the quality of the shirt is not good.Not good quality ( for the priceJacket selves not neatly put in.I LOVE this brand of pjs for my toddler and i was excited to see they make adult pjs.Guess these will be mfy for maternity PJ'S but that about it.Very fair price, less than satisfactory performance.Humongous.Beautiful in lor, it's going to be nice, but very disapponted in overall quality.I'll make my own to make it work, because it's still pretty and will work for a quick stume, but not overwhelming pleased.The appropriate quality for the price I suppose.This dress has no underwire or anything to help shape the curves.It's not nearly as glamorous as the picture makes it out to be.Needless to say I am spilling out of the cups, the top is adjustable which is a great feature and great material.Looked great but I slept over night and shower and the necklace has gone from gold to mental.Quality of stitching is not great either.For the price it is a very pretty skirt.Bright and almost silk like material.Seemed well built.Not high quality at all.Light weight pajama material.I use it for water aerobics and its life span is short, to months, needs a bit more of polyester to increase its life.Great shirtMaterial is thin but works well for layering.Not the material I was expecting.Dress is adorable, fabric nice, detailing workmanship is fine BUT it arrived with no tags whatsoever.I thought the chain was going to be a little more delicate and it tangles very easily, but other than that i love itVery pretty floral lace design lightweight, soft, and mfortable.The material is made out of chiffon which is lightweight and breathable material works well as a beach ver up or as a regular cardigan to protect your skin from the sun.It looks like it is made of high-quality material and the lace detail is very pretty.Good quality material though.I'll keep it and just have the top altered.Stones too large and ring spins so the back side of the ring is always in front.The fabric is a little thin for my taste but I would expect it to be ol to wear in warmer weather.Nice leather but if you expect to fit your cards in there and be able to get them back out forget it.Well put together.Not really flexible.I liked it because it had the adjustable chain on it.The elastic is all janky and lopsided.It looks like a home-ec project done by a year old.Otherwise its greatVery good material, but the dress old fashion style.Will work great after some fixing.It's a lot softer on the inside than my Squeem.Fabric ok. Not at all as presented in picture.Build quality seems fine to me.They are easy to adjust, and I usually forget I'm wearing them they're so mfortable.Good quality tights for the price.Ok shoe.Still not the highest quality but looks way better than it originally did.However, not as awesome as the picture for the product.But like price like fabricI love this necklace.The top itself is pretty and the material is good, very flowy.The white is bright and ol.The fabric is smooth and flowy, very soft and mfortable.Nothing against the shoe itself the shoes are great but they are NOT advertised rrectly.Definitely do not dry this tee.But decent quality fabric.I order a large and was a bit too loose on me Its a soft material.Not the best made slippers and not sure how well they will wear.The material is not tton and the stripes are more of a lavender it is very loose in the arms.Soft, mfortable, not as nice looking as I expected.I bought them to wear under a safety vest at work.They are light and airy...Its a really cute bikini, but you need a slim body The watch is clean looking- also very mfortable to wearI would only suggest them if they were for a speacial occaison as the design is beautful and the stones are perfect non missing at all on arrival and have stayed on with multiple wear)It is more mfortable than dressy.Paint chips easilyLOTS of material which I guess is to be expected and no problem for me, I'll just alter.Maybe that can be fixed when I lose some weight, not sure.I can't decide how I feel about the style of it overall it certainly looks different on me then the model for whatever reason.Great for a stume but quality ain't soo greatVery soft and mfortable Would've given it stars but it has removable pad liners in it which I'm not a fan of.I love the tassels which give it style.Not as warm as I thought they were going to be but warmer than tton crew socks.It's almost like a Monet because it looks better from far away.I just assumed it would be the same size and quality of all of the other marvel tin signs I have found at my local swap meets.Still a really good product if that is what you wanted out of it.The fabric of the Tee-Shirt is excellent.Color was good, material was fine.The material is not super flexible/stretchy and is kind of scratchy.Hope to get a few wears out of it nsidering it was so expensive.It does look nice when adjusted and it feels mfortable.Sleeve area a little tight but all in all it is good material, mfortable feelingCute design tho.The description doesn't say anything about being a cropped cardigan.So it's pretty to wear but I don't remmend wearing it all the time.Everything sticks to it.It is mfortable and really cuteNONETHELESS; it's absolutely gorgeous And removal is beming easier.I had to custom made my stume.It looks exactly as pictured though, I'm giving this to my toddler to use as a play purse.Still, a very beautiful dress with mfortable material.Really cute, nice material and well made.these are cute and are a fair price.she's , and it's not ideal to wear them for more than an hour or two because they are heavy.Good design but not good materialShinny material, ok nicely cutThey uld have used a better quality elastic.The fabric is polyester, which is clearly marked, but it just didn't feel too great to me.Good quality and arrived on time.They are mfortable, but they're not that great and here's my theory why everyone loves them: Most men are used to the all-tton boxers or briefs you can find at any clothing store.Cotton will absorb moisture, but it doesn't release it well.The pouch is mfortable, but not so much if you're sitting down all day.The main thing that makes these mfortable over mmon underwear) is the material.The fabric is just okayProbably work well for actual dance, etc but not mfy for just sitting around.I bought them to protect bottoms of my feet while moisturizing but they are too tight to wear for long.MUCH better quality.It is a really fun idea, but you have to be super tiny to wear it.Love the dress and material.These are extremely mfortable but stretch out within a short time of wear.Nice feeling, but too too much bling for me..It was a great fit ant I love the design but I only wore it one day and the picture looks like it's cracking already.There is no true arch support.Also the product does shrink some when washed as well.It's not your typical tton blend...The polyester ntent is a bit high for my tastes.The n is that they fall out just as easy so if you do purchase be careful.Great for the price.Not as durable as I would like.The under layer material does not have any give so I had to have a seamstress take it out and actually add material to the side seams underneath just so I uld breath mfortably.Quality of material uld be nicerI was hoping for a better quality product, the padding is not removable.The bra does fit well, if you don't need the padding and can sew then it would work for you.Not a very flattering look, but very mfortable for running errands or around the house.Washes well without fading.If not for that, they'd be perfect.The grips are nice, they give you added support even if you aren't using a yoga mat.Also, the top does slide down because the ribbing does not hold it up long term.nice, my husband is picky, it's fine for an over at on a ol nightAlso, the top/band is too wide for my rib cage so there is wrinkling in the black part that does not look good.Extremely durable just like every other Carhartt product.Quality overall is so-so.The printing on them made them stiff and not very mfortable.Longer than expected and scratches easilyNecklace is very pretty.Hopefully, if I wear it more, it will smooth out some.But for the price, it is a nice looking necklace and I don't regret buying it nor would I want to return it.It is really not sewn well, but it is pretty and fits nice.Materia is not soft but its ok.In white you can see through the bra to removable padding.No real stretch like you would expect from say a sports bra or a crop top.I have sewn for years and found the material to be of good quality.Very Nice ProductCool pouch idea feels mfy upfrontI ended up having to buy a much cuter and better quality suit from Burlington Coat Factory and it was cheaper than this too.Other wise my daughter likes them, they're warm but something needs to be done about the shedding.Would of been nice to have removable cupsIt's no big deal and can be fixed easily, but I would have liked it so much more if it came in perfect ndition.Pretty cuteThey are soft to the touch and so far, wash/dry well.Nice quality though.I love the pattern but it is starting to me unstitched & I have had a little over a month.)The new pants were fine but wish the sizing was more nsistent.The material is not flattering.I haven't washed/dried it yet, still deciding if it's worth the hassle to return and re-order.Fine for the price.Material is okay but not great.Dress arrived, looks and feels of beautiful quality but I remmend ordering up a few sizes.Quite elegant.They are a bit heavy and since my ears are thin, I do not wear but for a few hours.With my rose gold watch, somewhat dressy, they all look nice together.Fitting wasn't a problem since I went by chart now the finishing quality wasn't there for me so will be returning.I did notice great results after nsistently wearing it but after not wearing it for a while, the results fade away.Thought it would be a super cute, pretty stylish top.The shirt is cute and fits fine; but it's not the one pictured.It's still a cute shirt but it's not as lightweight and breathable as I would have liked.The luggage looks nice and stylish however the pieces are not reinforced as normal luggage.it flows nice and is long enough to ver slightly past my active wear pant line.was expecting slightly more of an activewear material and it is a little thinner than I expected, but overall I am happy with my purchase.Nice lor, good price and value though.Comfortable, but too sheerThe problem is on the bust area.Okay so I'm a lover of a good VB product, and of their wristlets.Seems warmlooks good but feels weird..just not too mfortable in this shirt.This is mfortable; soft t-shirt material.Even tho it is mfortable I probably wouldn't purchase this again.After I washed in ld water delicate cycle and hung dry, the material softened and shrunk a bit so now it feels a little less like I'm wearing a blanketQuite thick, but yarn is very soft and the quality of the knit/crochet is goodIt was not the mfortable loose fit I experienced with the Pattern Hip-Hop CapI purchased this pendant to hold pills that I take most days.I am currently on modified bedrest due to severe SPD and sacroiliac joint instability- aka: chronic pelvic pain.It's mfortable enough while standing and walking, meaning it's soft and not invasive.I find that it's very unmfortable while sitting, and because of how low I need support and how high my baby is still it presses right on my bladder.It doesn't stay hot for very long - minutes) but it's nice to be able to keep the heat right where I need it.This is a shoe I will wear with black dress pants or jeans when I need mfort and a little style, but I am not impressed.It looks nice, but it's not mfortable.She really likes the roominess.Cute and mfortable shoes.Not very good quality, but good for everything else.Love the design but was hoping the quality would be better.Fabric pills very easily and isn't the same throughout the sweatshirt.The style is very cute and the customer service is excellent.The pants were very long though, so we had to get them tailored to his length.Kind of wished it was tton.I did not read fabric ntent before purchasing and was somewhat disappointed in the fabric.It was slightly thick and not a real smooth feel.Very large but do work"Because it was so warm outside and I may have been glistening a bit, the product did not remain adhered to my skin.The carrying case is a nice touch, though.ALITTLE TOO SHINEY FOR MY TASTE AND NOT THE BEST QUALITY MATERIAL.cute but tear in the seams when washedI like the fabric it is perfect for hot summer weather.It does not flow to the ground.Not well made really but prettyAll the hardware has to be assembled on your own.Love the design but it's tight on me need a Well made and looks professional.I haven't worn it yet to know if it rides down or not.I'll still wear it but not for intense workouts that require greater movement and therefore greater rubbing and movement in the waist/ribs)The wrist band is not the greatest quality, but and will probably need to be replaced soon, but the person I gave it to absolutely loves it.It was a beautiful phone case and it fit but the design uld peel offBut it feels mfortable.It is still mfy.This one is my least favorite.If it wasn't for the fact that it fits my two year old toddler and is good quality, I would have rated it a .These workout leggings aren't extremely flattering on me.My favorite leggings yoga pants are the ones that have great tummy ntrol so you're not having wardrobe malfunctions while you're at the gym, but these fall short in that category.I appreciate the pockets, but I'm nstantly pulling them back up over my waist to smooth the love handle" bump they create.Those with an athletic body type might find that the waistband on these is perfect.This is a sturdy and attractive chain.I like these ankle stockings.They are silky and smooth but the knit is not as sheer as I would like for them to be, but they work just fineI was looking more calmer/smoother yellow.Soft stretchy material, slightly different lor.I did, however, give to a friend and she liked it a lot.Beautiful dress, however did not fit the need and look we expected.Looks good but the material quality seems just OKThe fabric is incredibly soft and slimming.Hat is nice, a little out of shape from mailing but really nice quality.She thought it looked good, but it was too much for me.It looks great, but its super scratchy.Looks cute BUT it doesn't stick too well...otherwise very ol.I was hoping these insoles would help with my plantar fasciitis and lessen my foot pains.a bit long I'm '") I can wear with higher heels.Look fine, don't know how well they will hold up.Light and mfortable.I give stars because they are totally see-thruI have not worn them for any length of time yet, I only tried them on.I'm not quite sure what I'm bothered about this top but it just didn't look good on me.These tanks are adorable which is the only reason they're getting stars.They'll be good for lounging around the house/working from home/PJ-wear, but definitely too form fitting and too short for me to exercise in until I lose more weight.The material is okayThis is a pretty ring, well made and a beautiful setting, however the ring I received was not sparkly at all, the stones were gray and flat.I realize it's an inexpensive cz ring, just was hoping for a little more sparkle.I would have loved it if it was longer.Otherwise great looking shirt for just running out for one night.These shoes look really great.I cut them off since its summer and sewed the edges.I do not show my legs, they are damaged better to keep them vered.Otherwise, there are mesh briefs available from other sources, but at MUCH higher prices.I think it was gorgeous, and the quality was nice.It was of okay quality and is nice enough for the price,but there are better options out there.I received my socks and everything is as expected.Looks likely to give trouble sooner rather than later.Leather is good and solid.It looks good.Really nicely organized with perfectly sized pockets for mmon purse things.The problem is this bag will significantly wear within a year - it will last longer than a year but it will look pretty beat up.Quality is what you can expect from the priceSexy verup.It's not made very well.The lor is beautiful and the bag roomy, but this is a very soft bag.It's perfect for a child.nice dress but the quality isn't the best.Beautiful shirt but the flower didn't last too long it came off right away but my daughter really loves this shirtAfter i cut the padding out the top fit and looked better.The material is not stretchy at all so it's hard to take on/off to use the restroom.It's cute for the price, though - just not the most mfortable or nvenient to wear.But the ruffles at the back are not evenly sewn.stitches reinforcing the lacing loops.We are unsure if it chiffon lace and loops) will be able to last the upming event.Good quality, I feel very classy in it.Looks awesome had to bend back the oart that was messed up shown in the first picture and carefully bent the top since it squished my ear It did not feel soft, but it was warm and if worn over a long-sleeve shirt or sweater, it probably would work well.Also the leg warmers were way too long.Somewhat form fittingIn fact the only reason i only gave it stars is because the black does easily scratchIf your husband is someone that works a lot with his hands hen get the silver one version of this ring.Thought they were thicker but still goodThey were folded when I bought them, so they are kind of bent.These pants look nice but you get what you pay for.They're cute and super mfortable.I wish they were better quality.I thought the material would be more mfortable and for beach use.It served it's purpose but isn't a wow" ver up....I had a Buttoneer years ago and it was much better made.The plastic pieces are really cheesy tooAren't the most mfy aren't very dark.Good qualityCute but hem does not match up (looks beautiful with alot of my looks and outfits.My husband had lost so much weight that I had to start to get him boys clothes, so these may actually be ok fit wise.Not as pretty in hand.Looks lovely on mePurse is nice but leather is kind of hard.thought it would be softerNot quite as attractive as shown on my mputer, but worth every penny of the very low) amount it st LOL).I wouldn't wear it as jewelry, but as a zipper pull on my purse, it will be fine.BUT it's not fleece at allI love the pattern.They are fun to wear but they are a little see-through so I have to be careful with what I wear underneath.Very soft material.Not really impressed with the fabricThe materials were surprisingly nice for the price but because it fit strangely, the lors were a bit tacky a more peachy lor and the style looked quite prom-ish she had to return it.Overall, the dress look wasn't too great.I love the lor the quality of the garment is meh".Good for light daily use going to school, walking to/from the car, etc.Definitely not water proof or warm enough for long periods of outdoor play.The dress in itself is beautiful well made and looked exactly like pictured.Quality is not that great.. Don't remember how much I paid for it but I wouldn't pay more than centsI love this piece but I can't wear non rusty lor necklaceThe material is great and silky.Material is super soft and hugs every curve of your body.Also this is a shear material.The quality uld be better, but its definitely good mpared to cheap materials.The front of the pin is beautiful.Given it's price, though, it's a good watch to wear during activities when you know it might get beat up.But it is very mfortable for a summer day/night.The only other mplaint I have is there are no pockets, I do love pocketsnice party summer wear.The elastic in the straps is too soft/stretchy to really provide any lift".The pattern was very pretty and the ruching was flattering.On a side note the fabric is not the most flattering if you're trying to ver up some trouble areas.The material is nice and light weight, it seems well made.The top itself is cute as can be and the material is a super soft.Too scratchy.Good quality just runs smallThe quality of the plugs are really nice.It held everything I needed it to hold and was made of a beautiful soft supple black leather.The leather does not feel nearly as soft as the Very Small Wallet, not even close.It did fit well and the lor was accurate, so l ended up keeping it to use to wear around the house.No arch support or traction on the sole but for the price it delivers what is expected.Also the material will show sweat so definitely will not be wearing in the summer.The leather material does not feel cheap at all, nor does the wallet lining and the stitching line is perfect.This nightshirt was a much better quality than I would have expected, for such a low price.It's very well made, very good feel.They seemed like they were good quality, but I had to return them because they did not fit wellGreat service from Red Plume Inc.Great pockets, holds a lot, cute.Beautiful suit thoughGood quality jacket so far.good quality product, only fault was that the zip was a bit stiff and was hard to unzipThe material looks inexpensive.Washed and dried it and bow fits fine.Quality is better than I expected.This outfit is well made although only suitable for the bedroom or a sex club given that the skirt is held together by velcro.The product is great and effective.It's satin shineI wish this dress looked better on me than it does, but overall, the dress is exactly what you should receive for the priceIt is a very long necklace, and I actually ended up hanging it at my desk in my office because I love how whimsical it is.I love it, but I can't wear it anywhere other than my back yard.If you're bustier, you're going to have issues with this vering you up enough/keeping you ntained, so to speak...but I guess that kind of depends on your modesty level?Nice looking aesthetically but quality is only so-so.Quality isn't the best mine got a run on my send use.I love Brighton jewelryit's pretty but does not glowNot the fit or fabric I expected at all, still hanging in the closetPhoto of the charm is much more clear and detailed than the charm itself.Great looking design, but runs too small and dye mes off on your hands.Basically wait til just after you showered, to make your lobes more elastic, use emu oil to make the transition a wee smoother.It will light in dark places.Now, I have a lot of other silver rings that I wear all the time and have no issues.They are always shiny, but these are not.So if you want a pretty date ring, or evening ring or just a sometimes ring, it works but if you are looking to wear it all the time, I wouldn't, just saying.is good but the fiux lether is peeling no good for meWould be great as a summer layer.it is a nice bracelet but way too fragile for an energy fill teenagerIt's pretty and while the material is a little on the cheap side it's still nice enough.LovelyThe faux leather" is very stiff.I would give it five stars if the material were looser.Well built and very nice product.The print is more paisley like, not lace-like but they are attractive.It does seem relatively warm and wind resistant I wouldn't say windproof" and the quality is good.Love the fit but the belt was sewn on backwards and the dress is thin..getting it lined and fixed tonight.I wish the had describe the material as very shinyVery nice lining inside.So that was pretty disappointing since it holds that adjustment piece down and looked better.For walking on the beach and for my age, it is fine.Was okay for prom as it was only worn for about hours and is beautiful, but I've gotten higher quality prom dresses for cheaper.Looks nice the only thing is that when it was packed to ship it was folded in half so it has a crease.so scratchy.My wife likes the purse however, the gun mpartment, which is formed for a gun, has some issues.Perhaps if it were made of a smoother material.I can't figure out if it's a heat mark or the beginnings of a run, like with nylon stockings.The material definitely doesn't hold up long.But the overall effect worksExcellent quality but is American size scale.It uld be air dried, of urse, but that's extra care we don't usually have to do on his shirts.The quality was nice and everything else was fine but I would definitely get a size or two up.I got several of these and they look nice unless they accidentally end up in the dryer, then they are ruined.I find the material not breathable enough for hot weather.They did not work for me, though, because they are designed to rrect over-pronation, so be aware of that.From the pictures, I thought I would be getting something a little more sturdy.Decent, just not solid enough for me.Loving the material and the lor, but the top part was small and not a push up bra.Cute, light and mfy but if this is a maternity skirt I must be a monkey's uncle.Once everything was put together, it was pretty and I received many mpliments.Of urse, now I've work them to work so I can't return them.wish it was a bit thicker and the zipper is a hassle I just leave it zipped to avoid the hassle, but defeats the purpose of having a zipper)looks cheaper than expected, but generally OK to wearLove the shirt.A bit fitted but overall good qualityAlthough I haven't worn it yet, just tried it on.Received many mpliments and loved this as a replacement for my set that's too big- however a small stone fell out, less than a year later.The pink one is of a softer leather and is better nstructed overall.Okay quality for one time use.Pretty cuteThe product was delivered as represented but I do not wear them for this reason.To much fabric up top.I love the fit, look and feel of these socks but many of the rubber dots came off on first use at barre class.Not the same quality.The inside has a lining that I didn't expect.Although the lining uld be nsidered a sign of quality, I didn't appreciate it because I wanted a hat that would let air circulate and keep my head olWell made, but scratches to easy for the money you payThe quality is good, I and ' " and ordered a M and it too short.I was not aware of that because there is no model pictured in this sweater.I'm not saying this isn't a good sweater or that it isn't cute, if you like the / sleeve look and cropped sweaters this is perfect for you.Not loving that lookIt wasn't flattering on me, nor did it end up being my style.Comfortable and nice material.Fabric quality is good but this is not anywhere near being long.I will say though, if you are a smaller bottomed girl, this suit is surprisingly good quality for the price.I own a lot of neoprene wetsuits and swim suits) and this feels about the same, though has much less stretch than my other neoprene products.The straps are a little flimsy, but the suit itself is a nice sturdy material.My son loves the patternsIt really is a good ncept and would be so perfect for running or walking at night or early morning if they would only stay on my shoesVery warm nice fleece only mplaint that I have is and has a weird smell like petroleum or gasoline substance I remmend to wash it first to get rid of the smell after that it was fineVery pretty nice quality.I do have very small ears and not much for the cuff to cling to, but it would be nice to wear nonetheless.Not the highest quality, but it worked well enough for my uses.It felt more like a single breasted at that was off-centered instead.The material is thick and stretchy, lor is just slightly cream.These boots are gorgeous, but are too tight in the toes for my wide feet.I'm pretty sure earrings are supposed to me in pairs of .Other than that quality of actual earring is good.Somewhere between a dress and a top, its cut nice but the material is super see through.this is a vibrant and beautiful bracelet.Very cute pajamas.It's lightweight like a t-shirt so they can wear it in the house or on Spring days outside.I just do not like the material.Not great quality, but adequate in a pinch.I did not realize this was a fake ring so I am returning it, based on what I saw it is good quality, I am just looking for the real thing.Material is stretchy and fitting, wished it was biggerMissing a stone, but a beautiful ring.Very mfortable, but didn't realize the bottom had elastic and balloons out a bit more than I would like.Pros: prompt shipping, soft material, beautiful lace detail.Other than that it looks exactly like the picture.Shape is perfect.The quality of the tux is quite good, especially nsidering the price Globe appears to be well-nstructed, but some glue was visible at top where silver seal is located.Overall, I like it a lot for design and this is a necklace I've wanted for a while.But saying that if you only do cards really and don't have much this wallet is perfect for youThe item description needs to be clearer.Not my favorite, a little to much fabric in the chestI have them held together with electrical tape in different places, and I'm not exactly out running marathons in them, here.I'm determined to wear them all summer because they were so damn expensive but for the price, they really should have held up much better.The dent doesn't inhibit wear, but it isn't very aesthetically appealing much like the design).The jewelry posts are always, ALWAYS too long to wear mfortably.But these are perfectThe top however is very padded so being a C, it definitely gave me some cleavage.The Velcro design is not user-friendly.not as full as I would have liked, but we'll made and you only have to worry about modesty on the top.I decided to keep it since it was so cheap and just wear it in the backyard.The tie seemed well made but was not any longer than my off-the-shelf" standard ties.Its a good item.Looks great but it's heavy due to the canvas.So, better to wear these ones early on, before the puffiness sets in.Also, I find that this type of fabric doesn't stay up very well, and you spend all day hiking them up even if they fit well.They are incredibly soft and mfortable and the mesh panels help keep things in place.It is pretty silver.didn't give me the sparkle like other pieces that I haveI wear a sticky bra in nude/skin tone and I don't have many issues.The back detail is so sexy and flirty.Fairly loose, but pretty soft for an acrylic material.Lesson here is don't trust the photosSoft.Will be wearable after washing, because it smells out of the pkg.I will keep it, because it will still work for my purpose plus I just don't have time for an exchange before I need to use it.Well-made and cute.Neutral rating of .The dress was ok but not as nice as the picture.I love the design and the fabric is mfortable.I'm very busty though.LOVE LOVE LOVE this ring Great qualityHeavy runs big beautifulDescription said: % wool but it is actually % acrylic.Quality was good I think.Band is not very durable.Beautiful but not what I expected.It indicated leather but it was vinyl.Well priced organic undiesFabric, fit and finish are great.Rear pockets are fine, in fact they uld be less deep and still work satisfactorily.Not as cute in personOne is fine and the other has holes.I am guessing a bad a lot but disappointing since the quality had bee fine.No protective qualities at all.Cute, good quality shirt, but arrived with a hole in it.Pretty cute The fleece inside makes them quite warm and great for staying warm in the winter.The fabric pills after washing and they aren't as a stretchy as I would like but otherwise a great pair of leggingsThe shoulder is this off white mesh type material (.Material is very soft and design is pretty on front back totally plain."Cashmere feel" tag right on front of scarf.Lots of mpliments but super huge and leaves a mark on your hand.Costume jewelry only.One in the beige floral lace and another in the navy floral.Some smetic defects around the seams but for the most part they have held up and are quite mfortable.Leggings didn't hold up very well.But with a long camisole underneath it's fineJust have to be careful of the loose wires inside the sweater.fabric isn't very good quality- it is quite rough and itchy.I was expecting a light, soft tton blend.Fabric is light weight so not winter appropriate.These are NOT toddler socks.Other than the size issue the socks are nice and thin.Perfect for summer or dress shoes.Plus the bangs are super long, almost as long as my normal hair.Costume was excellent, but it was missing the scarf and belt, i need it for a play and it was to late to send back for replacement because then I wouldn't get it back in time for a play.Beautiful Material but kind of deceiving.Can't sweat it, for the price thoughThe material was not as expected, but still makes it a fun sexy shirt.The cut of the dress is very cute and flattering and I received different mpliments on the dress the first day I wore it to work.I read another review that said it was light t-shirt material."The material is a little stumey to me but it's cute.Nicely made glasses make it so I can read the radio display and gauges while driving and still have a clear view of the road.Heavy polyester feel and don't buy if you have cats or care about lint.Still, great for winter work outs or as pajama alternatives.Good but not shine just on the photoGood quality just made a little on the small side.First of all the socks are made of a good stretchy material, but for me when I wore them they would not stay secure on my thighs.Otherwise good material.The shirt and tie it self is still nice, but the tie is not the exact same as pictured that's the whole reason for me buying it this is mpletely different, that's why I'm only giving three starsWonderful verage for leather dye.High quality, but the rdovan lor is VERY dark and almost black.The resolene product from Fiebing is excellent and expected this dye to be perfect.It fit as expected and looks/feels good, BUT one of the black balls on the end of the straps came off the FIRST day.It's not leatherI like the looks of the product and the quality.The top is great and so is the material.If the material were nicer and heavier so that it hung closer to my waist, it would be more flattering.I love the material, but it is a little bit longIf the design uld be improved, I'd remmend the following: ) Solid and patterned shirts" not everyone looks good in stripes) ) Softer material for the skirt"After a month of diong miles a week, I still have a hard time clipping itIt looked like great material and that it would work but it was too big so I went back and bought my original one from waist gang society.It's a nice shirt, loved it when I first got it.Great qualityShe loves it and says it's mfortable and warm.She sewed it up herself and it's holding fine now but just be aware that the stitching may be very weak.Not sure why it wasn't stitched.I think it would be a great winter purse.This shirt fits well but when I opened the package it was a huge burst of a vinagar smell.It was overwhelming.They need to have pull tabs' to get the film off... and yes, the plastic needs to be reinforced... it needs to be about times stronger or thicker.And I'd pay twice the price for a better quality product... especially if it was polarized.Obviously a cute bag, but the price of shipping is just too muchGood quality fabric.It felt great everywhere except through the forearm and under arm pits.Always satisfied with Polo Ralph Lauren's quality.Quality was good, soft material and I'm gifting it to a friend.Nice thick sweater i repeat sweater not a dress anyway shape or formWashed okay, but I don't dry anything like this.Yet I love how it looks, and have always gotten mpliments the few times I've worn it.I can only wear it to events no longer than a uple hours or it chafes too much and I need to take it off.The back sets below my bra.I would like to wear it often because it is my LOGO..."LIPS" But I have to wear a long sweater over it just to be mfortable.Feel like stone, but they can't be real jade.They looked good though..I thought it would look a little more expensive.They are well made and good quality but I bought them as I perspire.I wish it was a better quality but the price was right.Very soft and reasonably thick for the bargain.Not great but super cheapquality uld be better, was expecting better from Woolrich, then the sizing, I measured myself and bought this to be a little large, because I like my clothes to allow freedom of movement.Since the price was so good, I just altered it a bit myself.Wonderful shirt, just wish sizing was clearer.Other than that, perfect, super soft and cuteThe wood itself is ok, and the packaging that it came in was in a bag.It was also just wrapped in a styrofoam material as it's only source of protection.I really like the qualityThe glasses themselves seem sturdy and block sun quite well, so I'm pleased in that regard.I've purchase much cheaper dresses in bet quality.Other than that it looked beautiful on her and it did it's jobThe glasses arrived on time and well packaged.However, they are made in China, not Italy as my other pair as I bought these as replacements.Other than that, they look fine, I just hope they will last as long as the original ones.I love the dress it's gorgeous but I was not aware that it came with a build in bra.All in all the earings are very pretty and would have loved to be able to wear themOtherwise my kid absolutely loved them.The item iteself was beautiful and looked well made.The material is good, it's well made.The pin is metal and stays on very well.There is no lining anywhere.It would take strategic movement to ensure the important parts are vered even when it's dry).Love the bathing suit, but there was no elastic in the butt.Though it was a good value, I didn't care for the quality of the material, as I thought it was to thin.OK quality.But for the price i wasn't expecting great quality.Comfy otherwise.Not well made- you get what you pay for...Which was easily altered by a family friend.OVERALL it is a decent dress, my sister loved it and had a great time in it.I'm a little disappointed that the cloth changed- the large one was made out of tton that felt really nice and soft.Also, the fabric isn't great.The crystals aren't lined up right to look very good.Its looks nice but its super obvious its a fake, the diamond is scratchedI love the overall design of the shirt, the lace is heavy duty so fear of ripping is minimal which is a huge plusGood quality .. Pedi M and so I stay The material is great and the length.Expressed hope that the model name on the packaging.The workmanship was very good, but the sizing is not right for curvy figures, just too narrow in the hips.I will say that the set is made really well.It looks exactly like the picture.Would have appreciated a heads up but the photo shows two.This is very well made.Fully lined, lots of detail, nice fabric.Nice top.Light and flowy.they looked beautiful thoIt was made well, the material is thick and strong, and the zipper was sturdy.The fabric is actually very lightweight which is okay with me.Quality is not as good as Shadowline.Zipper does not work as expected, I'm having hard times zipping the purse, purse is nice overallThe item seems to be of quality material and is beautiful, however, this is not a dress but rather a shirt.The warmth will not reach your fingers.What I've found that works are MEN'S HIGHCAMP -FINGER GLOVES with one or two glove liners depending on the temperature.These OR gloves also work well with Seirus Thermax Liner Gloves which have a pocket for a heat packet so that all of the heat is released within the insulation of the glove now that's a smart design).Stylish and mfortable shoes that will last your active child about . months, which is why I rated them as stars.My next purchase will be of a higher quality shoe since my daughter's shoe size has been pretty unchanging for about months.Otherwise for the price its a decent jacket.The quality is excellent with very beautiful patterns.Love this little snitch necklace but, the chain was super short making this more of a choker than a true necklace.Does not feel like soft leather feels like vinyl.The pajamas are ok, but I definitely uld have gotten the quality or better for half the price at Walmart.Way over priced.Nicely made but thicker than I expected.These shades work great...Looks great and feels nice.I did like it and It looks exactly like the picture but it was short on me.I'd love a stronger tapper to the torso lapels but over all a great thread unt.Beautiful, but part of earrings fell out of the settings.It also had a great stretch.Just OK. Not crazy about the material.It cam with a stain, but rather then that it was nice.Good quality and quite warm but the legs are quite long.So the socks are well made, but thin makes sense since I will be wearing them with flip-flops).I absolutely love these, despite being too large in the waist and I had to cut holes in all the button.It looks like plastic but is very spaciousLooks stylish, not really high end" design.Will keep and wear, but not for what was intended.It was a nice little necklace but the lightening bolt makes it top heavy and flips down all the time.Love the print not the qualityAs an orthotic, I think the quality is fair.They offer more support and are more mfortable than other low-st orthotics I've tried.I was disappointed in the quality of this scarf, though the lors are beautiful.I love the design but I can't wear it due to being a little chubbier than what is required.The Scarf is nice and vers my head and neck well.It's made really well.Just wish it was a bit longer and with adjustable straps.It might just be my pronation/supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride.Average of miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill.I LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms.They really give me support and flex needed.I think these glasses are OK, they look good, they have a nice fit, I still gotta try them in the middle of the day when sunlight is heavier.Obviously these are a replica, though the price of the product it is very good.Other than that, very warm and prettythe waist was fine and so was the hips.Cool Jammie pants wash in ld or elseQuality was good though.They look great and are wearable though.But the design is very interesting.A+ design, C for nstruction.The front closure doesn't me nearly together enough for me, but it is pretty.Very sheer and I am not a big fan of the material.It is slimming, but I would have preferred better quality material.Not the same one as in the picture, it's a very cheap quality but still looks nice if accessorized wellOtherwise I have enjoyed wearing when I piece when I want to relax and still look presentable.Looks like real leather but buttons fall of easilyY don't like fabricsThe material isn't the best quality- reminds me of a deluxe Halloween stume.It's not soft Cotten, more like a stretchy tton/polyester blend.Nice bottom nice material but the top had no padding and it's very loseThey are mfortable.They are see-through, nice for around the house as long as you're around people mfortable seeing your package in it's entirety.Very affordable is definitely the saving grace with these.However, even with that being the case, it's still a cute shirt and the fabric is nice and soft.this is a lovely cuff but doesn't hold hair ties like I had hopedDidn't rest on my wrist very well but it might just need to be worn a few times first.They're cute, soft and mfortable except for the fact that, as other reviewers have mentioned, they do slide off in the back when I do more walking in them.Wish it fit a little better But warm and mfortableCloth uld have been of a better quality.This necklace was great at first.I folded some of the material over on itself to create an extra drape so that the top would be less baggy and the bottom would lay better.Good productFabric to heavy for summer wear.These are beautiful earrings but they came to me in pieces, and I can't get the set to stay in.Wish it was a bit thicker, but fine for the price.Don't know at this early date how the plating will hold its shine, but okay for now.I also have the Endor one from Return of the Jedi which does have the stitching on the bill and i feel like it's slightly higher quality.The fabric feels great, the top of the dress fits perfectly.Love the fabric but more of a bodyn dress I have big hips)It needs more tension.They look oler than they feel.She looked beautifulHowever, both the chain and the butterly are lightweight and mfortable.The butterfly sits nicely without nstantly flipping over and the wings are soft, rounded edges, so it is mfortable to wear.Basic chain that you find with most stume pendant necklaces.It is not quite as shiny as I saw online, which I prefer, because it gives it a nicer look.For the price, the detail of the butterfly and the day prime shipping, this was a great buy and I will wear the butterfly often this summer on another chain and on a charm bracelet.For the price, they are very nice, though they need ironing.The fabric is nice, and not see through, which is a plus for white.So, this is a perfect NOT Luxottica brand with good quality for the prices that the glasses should st if there was no monopoly in the market.I like these, they're sturdy and seem to be very good quality.These are nice glasses, if only they can figure out how to work the hinges.The workings are great, materials are nice, but it is kind of bulky with very narrow slots to place multiple cards if you have a lot to carry around.Comfy waist trainer.This dress is very pretty, the lors were nice, and the material is stretchy.It's a beautiful at but the sizes are offNice quality fast shipping, but they are too small.I'm giving stars because it's a gorgeous at, made well.The fabric feels great.Button itself is very nice, but it is only nnected to the pin by spring tension.It's okay for the price, needed a clutch in a pinch for a weeding, did the trick.Beautiful lor and nice texture but too small for me to use as a wrap.Lovely packaging.Definitely not a winter shirtQuality not so good but fits too priceHigher quality fabric would have been better for this look.No like materialBut I will somehow make it work for what I need it for.It is stained.It's great because it has lots of room.There are others that are better quality out there, although it is definitely hard plastic.So, all in all, nsidering the price and the quality, I would purchase again, but with caution.The material is warm and soft so it's perfect for chilly days.Not the best basketball shoe.The material for this jacket seems more rainat like than leather / It fits pretty well though and it seems to be really warm.The netted/mesh part of the dress is see-thru so your bosom/bra and some of your butt cheeks will be seen, so be mindful.This was what I expected for the price.The inside is a little scratchy feeling, but it doesn't bother me.On the up side, it is warm, and looks good as a day time sweater for the fall, or around the office.The reason it is not .* product is that it is extremely mfortable around the crotch area and rides up in that area.very cute nose ringgreat for the price, workwellits an ok shirt for the price but not well tailored.It's pretty and looks nice, but if wearing a wet bathing suit under it, the parts of the suit that touch the material, especially the chest area, show up as spots" on the material until it dries.Cute patterns and nice quality fabric, probably more suitable to a smaller baby -lbs.The leather quality is not as good as my other Dooney bags.The leather on the larger size is quality.The top is perfectMakes me feel secure and sexy.works great, nice texture and stretch.Otherwise, a great shirt.Well, in truth it looks and feels only like polyester.Wish this product was made with % or something of equal quality.It's definitely wearable to the office.Looked nice, but Snags easily so not planning on wearing more than once.Material is soft and ol.Everything seems to be made good.Fashion Jewellery as expected.My daughter loves this..but the metallic fabric rubs off after the first swim, showing the black fabric.The dress was cute and great material for warm weather.Good quality for the price.Just like VS, very soft.I will keep it to use as a longer shirt thoughTsk tsk for lying about product details.Would look really cute as flair on a bagEXCELLENTNice ring, nice finish and looks solid.The ceramic in that sense is homogeneous and even scratches will remain black.also the fabric is heavy and straps are easy to seeThe scrubs are great.Cute top.Like the looks of the shoe; quality seems good.Probably ideal for sun shade working in the garden, but unfashionably broad for social use.Fun to wear and not worry about losing or breaking.Material is not exactly ..luxury, but fairI'll spend more money on higher quality next time.The material is a little unmfortable, and fades after the first wash, but it's still a beautiful shirt.It gets easily dirty so not appropriate for girls who likes to play at the park all the time.I was expecting better qualityLooks good so far.Shoes are fine.They are cute but I was unaware when I bought them that the heel is silver.Did not love these underwear.Just not super mfortable.Thin fabric, but looks nice after ironing.These are nice but they fade quickly and wear down just as fast.I thought this would be more like chiffon material maybe I shouldve read more closely) but it's more of like a stretchy bathing suit material.the wallet is of great quality and very functional.One of the pieces on the bra was off when it arrived so I had to hot glue it together and all of the edges needed to be ironed down.Nice material, but more dotted than expected.Not flattering at this size.These glasses are okay for the price.I'm not sure it's leather.Smells like vinyl or PVC.The material is indeed very thin, but not too see-through, and will be nice and light in the summer.I was hoping it would be a more substantial fabric, but it's a lighter satin-type material.My dress came with a little red belt that will need to be dress-taped to stay put, but for the price this was an okay buy.I liked the ability to get so many different lors and styles for the price, however the quality is definitely lacking.The metal is also very cheap, but I do not have sensitive skin so it works pretty well for me.One feather came off in shipping a send came off during initial handling.This is super mfortable as well.Really not a very mfortable feeling garment.The fabric is not very soft.They're cute shoes, and I wish I uld have made them work.Comfy but my feet get sweaty when working in these crocs due to no ventilation.As a former foot model I think these are very good design for working kitchen or slip resistant environmentsThe material really wrinkles, so haven't ironed it to see how it fits when hanging well.Better quality than expected and mfortable.Would like this better in a racerback so the straps would stay put.The ThinOPTICS are amazing, but this case is thin and will NOT protect your phone.Returning to get the adhesive ThinOPTICS they are amazinglooks better on the picture.It provides less support than stockings.It seem to have flattering fit.It's light but very warm.Now that it's January and the weather is getting oler I have been able to wear it...Very sad that it's fall apart so soon, but for the price it's to be expected...The picture is far better than the product.very cute but not mfortable at all.The fabric is really not great in the end because of the way it holds odors.I'd love to update you on the post-wash quality, but the stench really dampens my enjoyment of these briefs.The ribbon bows on the leggings are not even tied into bows and they don't look all that great.The sawing is done nicely though and I feel like it's a good fabric.Not made very sturdyWith a few alterations i will be able to wear it Love the quality and material.is beautiful, but the fastener leaves a lot to be desired, it falls off, regularly, it needs a magnet closure, or another closure.otherwise, would be amazing.everything fits well warm on the insideCute idea for a bathing suit, however, it is not made with quality fabric.Overall look of the watch is great but whether the internal mechanisms of the watch will last still needs sometime to monitor Too much work with all the strings.Cute and decent quality...I do think it looks cute though, I just think the quality uld be improved.The shirt fits well, but is made of very thin fabric.good qualitySandal is mfortable with good arch support but too wide in the front even with max adjustment.Material is also on the thinner/see through side will be good for summer.Long story short, I would purchase it again if it were cheaper.They're mfortable on the face.I do LOVE the material though, it is very soft.This will now be my knock around outfit because it is so mfortable )I'm giving these shoes stars because they are a nice quality and quite pretty.They have very little elasticity and aren't easily rolled up.The plus side is that quality is there for sure, and shipping is reliable.Lovely picture.I actually really like the lace-up front design and the metallic side zips.It'll be a perfect add-on to a hot clubbing wardrobe, IF it is of the length as shown in the photo.Not ideal for ld winter nights.Light, easy to use.Comfortable but a bit thin.Could see panty lines so I would wear this as lounge wear only.Very thin skimpy but ol for hot weather.I like the materialIt is super warm which I love.The quality isn't that great,But price is reasonable for product.It was stunningIt came in a nice box...I love the size of the stone.I love that it won't ever tarnish or rust.The center stone at the top of the ring is a little loose and I'm hoping it's secure enough to stay and not fall out.The reason for the stars...is....it is beautiful...but when you touch it ..it is so prickly.I put fingernail polish on it to help...and it does..Stones are pretty..Flattering cut, very feminine, though rather long on me at '".Great customer service, thoughThe back is plain zip up not like picture lace up back) The lace is more off white than silver and the sleeves are not right.Pretty top.But I have other bottoms that look good with it so that's okayI thought it would be loose, but it was not.Not exactly the high quality I had expected, I would say it was medium quality.If you think the price is worth a medium quality wallet, then I feel you will be satisfied with this product.The buckles are not lined up so if you close one the other will not stay closed, if it wasn't for that I would buy more of themThe transparent material is stretchable but doesn't stay well in place. stars though, because it is cheap and still offers a little support, and the back lace design is adorable.It's not form fitting.The material is very thin so it needs to be worn with an under shirt as well.Since the ability to make the front pieces meet was a feature I would have preferred, we'll have to see.ating came off quickThey also cut into my thighs, which isn't flattering and is noticeable under jeans.For the price, I think they are still worth a shot, but I think you'd need to mbine some other shapewear with these to get good results.Love Carhartt products for my husband, but these pants weren't what we expected.Nice and warm but they do get those little numbs up after a few washings.Not the best quality but severs its purpose around the house.I'm still getting used to it, i will use it but a will keep looking for an elegant red bag.i still haven't worn them These do not seem as well made as the ones I had before.The top strap is not of as good of material as my old ones.The arch support and cushioned sole, however, are very good.I like the style and material, though.Perfectand good material.The thread is not holding well.It is a very cute purse but not very durableThis piece looks nice in the box, but because of where the chain nnects to the pendant, it doesn't sit flat on the chest.The actual sweater fits fine but the belt that you tie was made for a child and it is not able to be used with this.looks good onExactly what I expected for the price.Definitely not made to wear in below freezing winter weather.Very cute dress, however the fabric was very thin and not of good quality.I don't feel like it has a very professional look to it.This is an awesome looking ring.The back of the octopus's head is smooth and has a cleft".Just bought hair haven't wear it yet but wish it fuller and thicker in texture.They look good on the outside and they are mfortable, bit turn them inside out and you will find they are unraveling right out of the package.Very pretty in person.They were not particularly mfortable without the socks though, so plan on using some kind of padding/insert.Even so, its very pretty, very soft, and works well for what I needed.It's great except that the average makeup brush is too long for the location the bag allows for them.pretty see through not great quality fabric but cute printI love this product, but as a tunic.Wish the straps had some chain.It was ok, didn't like the material.I bought them to walk around in and be mfortable, but they're not, so now they just llect dust in my closet.They're good quality and look nice, though.Really expensive for what it is.Comfortable housedressThe fabric has a great feel for summer.I only wish the slits had been executed better.Still wearable and absolutely worth the price.The chain turned green after a week but the pendent is niceI managed to bend them to make it work but they definitely do not stay on.Not subject to trimming.This is a lovely and sleek bag with all the mpartments I wanted.The send reason is the chains easily tarnish with normal wearing of the necklace, within days of wearing it, the chains were no longer the vibrant gold lor as shown.Though you if you don't mind the tangling and disloration happening, it's a ok piece of jewelry for the price.It's perfect.An inexpensive versatile Halloween stume.Not quite enough verage for my tastes.A well made leather bag but did not meet the beauty of what I have me to expect from a Brahmin handbag.These underwear don't have a pouch for the man parts but keep you ol though the clothes and feel mfortable.Shirt was a bit shorter then I expected or was mfortable with.Comfortable dress, not thrilled with the bottom of it.Love the lor and the size is mfortable.It hasn't broke yet and still entertains him.It's a very pretty top but I felt too much exposure in the breast area on the side shows...but I'd you want super sexy and don't mind it's greatMaterial was a bit less refined than expected very casualGood material and decent delivery speed, but the top is made for large chests.Nice gift but lightweight and not a high quality item.a bit too tight on arms, otherwise good strong fabricI was hoping for better quality.Hat was a little long so as the top sits on your head it looks kinda weird, but I still got mpliments on it and it's still very warm.They would be super cute if they were more durable.they are mfy but the threads are nstantly pulling and need to be cut so not made the best.It's a quality piece of satin but don't expect this to keep you warmOverall, this is a great stume.This would be easily fixable by undoing the stitches and sewing the foam pieces back on to fit the leg better, but it should have been rrect to begin with.Not quite what I expected quality-wise.The key differences between this belt and that one are primarily in the leather and the buckle.The leather on this belt has a very nice soft feel as if it is already broken in.However, the leather is so soft that after just a few days or wearing it I have already noticed that the leather is bunching up around the belt loops.This seam impedes the belt from rolling on smoothly.Plus it is made in the USA which is always nice.The above statements are based on my own personal experiences with the product.Pattern is printed on dress so wasn't sure how it would stand up to wear and laundering.Runs small but for the price, the quality was very nice.Looks homemade.Not exactly the material I thought it was going to be.But watch out because after a uple months my clip for the chain totally fell apart, but besides that, it was a great productMaterial is not that great but for the beach I guess it will do the job.I find little shreds of black pleather in the pockets and the metal rings for the straps are starting to me loose as well.Cute for home use though.Very lightweight but mfySoft flexible material.Warm overall.Quality is ok.It's a thick heavy lace.While the design is very unique, the material is very thin.The material is nice, light, and spring appropriate.The top fits fine but the bottoms dig in at the hips.I'm hoping after wearing them awhile they will get softer, but I won't be able to wear them a whole day for quite some time.A real shame because they are great shoes with that one exception.It definitely pulls you in, but it's not very mfortable to wear for extended periods of time, I only wish I purchased this closer to my delivery rather than several months postpartum.This is well made---soft and zy.Waistband isn't the thick/wide seam I typically love, but when you're wearing these for a stume at this kinda deal, you can't get too picky about little details.it was mfy but large around the bodyJust wish the description and photos accurately represented what I would receive.It's pretty and delicate, but not exactly what I was expecting.Nice, thin, summery material.The band's are very thin, and I have reservations about how well they would hold up under everyday wear.This is something I will only wear on few occasions and would suggest finding it elsewhere if you want higher quality materials.The quality is much better on Leveret brand PJs, so sticking with those.Was a lovely dress for my sister's wedding.Cheap Not What I Expected, But Somewhat Ok For The Price.Fun bright lor perfect for summer .Nice bracelet and sturdyvery mfortable fabric.soft.The butterfly pattern is beautiful and it was just what I was looking for.I had no issues with the fit, but it just did not drape or hang properly.That said, it is still usable, just not as attractive looking as the photos were.The yarn was slightly itchy, but I wore long sleeves beneath, so that made it better.Its cute, the skirt it long but its okThe shoes and Lights look greatFor the price, it can't be beat.I really like this ring because it is the perfect width to go with my engagement ring but one of the diamonds fell out after only weeks so I am fairly disappointed with the quality of it.I have not worn them yet so can't judge how long they would be mfortable.I did notice scratchy seams across the top where the elastic is attached to the shoe so not sure how mfortable they will be without socks so giving three stars because may hurt when I wear them.From what I uld tell was made out of nice material and would've been mfy to wear.not so shiny but it's okayEver Pretty was great about refunding the st of the dress not any of the shipping sts).The quality is above average for todays products but thats not saying a lot.Arrived wrinkly, seems ok quality.It is nice for the price.Looks very nice and is quite mfortable, but came apart at the seams in some areas.Cute looks like the pic but the soles look plastic not sure if that's safe for the snow and ice.These are thick gloves so I think that's why it's not so great for texting.At some extent it does let you text, but not properly, I mainly wanted these to keep my hands warm while I walked my dog in the mornings and at night, so it did the job.great price greatThe watch keeps good time but the step monitoring is quite a bit off on accuracy.Seriously Amazon, why skimp on the setting?These shoes are really nice looking.This is an excellent dress and would remmend it to anyone.It is a very mfortable dress as well, so you can feel relaxed as well as give you a gorgeous feeling all at the same time.The quality is OK.The fabric is light, so I wear it at home.I will have to midify them to be able to wear mfortable, otherwise the wings" are as advertised.I'm only weeks, I'm sure i'll be able to use this in my third trimester, I hopevery mfyIt doesn't give her neck verage like this one would but it's not all over her face and distracting her.Very soft and warm though and good for a chubbier baby on a ld night.Really pretty, feminine sweater, nice and heavy but not too heavy.Not worth the high price charged for themThe band isn't as mfortable as one would think.Still very sexy on, but not very mfortable.The dress seems like a good quality.It's not tight, just seems like a mfy daydress.nice but very bulky turned my current wallets bulk into a giant mass in pocketOverall quality is good.This is great for layering but that was not what I intended for in my purchase.Silin strip on the strap mes off too easily and fast.it is reflecting from the insideEverything is great with this product.Exact replica.Perfect.I can wear it but it's too tight and probably won't beme a favorite.For a T-shirt that sts this much, I expected better.Beautiful case but none of my watches will close.Gorgeous and fabric is great, but just needed to exchange itIt is a really cute suit and seemed well made.This wasn't a huge deal but for the price I would expect them to be sewn better.Also the material feels like well, I'd prefer tton for health purposesMy daughter loved this shirtMake sure to wash and hang dry, because it doesn't hold up well and looks pretty worn after a few washes.The teal is La Clef" and drapes very nicely and is a great length ' the mustard and heather grey are Hello Miz" and are shorter and more narrow.The differentiation of the lor of the stones is not as strong as pictured.I expected this to be a amazing travel pillow.The hands on the beautiful watch face are not clearly delineated.The necklace is pretty.Not as delicate and dainty as I expected.It looks great.Product was late which was not good because I needed it for vacation and I didn't have it.Nice light weight material though, just wish the arms were a bit longer and the neck was a bit wider like pictures.The fit and style is great, the fabric feels nice...I gave this -stars bc of the smooth fabric.Material and stitching is good, but the bottom is a little bit see through and some people may prefer to wear a slip to be safe.Fit was nice and as expected and this shirt is very mfortable.However the strap leaves much to be desired.It is neither mfortable nor is it durable.This bracelet is pretty, but won't suit my needs.It is very beautiful but not so great if you're busty and looking for some verage.I like the ring, it is a really good quality, but it is kind of large and looks weird on my belly button, but my roommate has a larger belly button and it looked good on her.Awesome socks.I do not care for the material and it hugs my body too much.it is not as attractive as it shows.I would love it for work attire, true to its description as thin; perfect for spring/summerOkay nothing spectacular other than pocketsGood product, good quality, but not like top of the line jerseys.The product is exactly the same as seen in the picture.Cute but the fabric is ok. After washing once the fabric is not so good.I didn't want stretch tton but it was my fault but I gave them to my daughter and she loved themThe fabric and style was exactly what I wanted.It feels like something my grandmother would have worn.Quality seems to be good and fits as expected.Son fixed it, this was a gift to grand child, and all seems well.The bottom of the legs have brass zipper closures to enable the bottoms to open for getting the pants on/off, and then to close for a snug fit where its needed at the bottom for bike riding.Excellent design and nstruction for mountain bikingAs mentioned, this IS a very sturdy, good looking bag.I got this for my husband and he loved it BUT it wasn't very functional and uldn't hold his cards so I ended up getting him another more practical one.For what it is though he loved the quirkiness of it because hes a bit of a nerd ) Its a really ol ncept and sleek looking product but not very functional.The top is also very thin will definitely need a cami underneath.But the lor and craftsmanship are good.Material is very light and I am not sure if it will hold up.Plus, I do feel that the front area, from the forehead should be a little more open to make it a better fit.It is made from Halloween stume material.So tent like materials not soft fabric.It is short and multiple pieces.Exactly as pictured.the decals still look great, but the sweatshirt does not.It is a nice necklace and came with two chains.Really really cute at for the price.Love the shirtThe Pros: Comfortable, forming tapered cut, unique design.It seems to be quite durable.Other than that, the hat is well made and is nice looking.The torso was read with silver sparkly things.Cute summer-to-fall night life throw on.Assuming I had a friend w/ this taste to give it to.Guess I'll hang it on my wall as an incentive to lose weight and perhaps fit it sometime in the future.For the price, they're fine.but It made me seems artsy as hell.It was more loose than I expected so it's not flattering, but whatever, it's mfortableI was nstantly tightening it on pants where traditional belts have always been less fussy and largely forgotten.My intended purpose was for casual wear.However, I'd much rather wear a D-ring belt for casual wear or a versatile, traditional belt.These tennis shoes are cute and my daughter says they're mfortable so I'm giving them stars BUT after only months the lights in one shoe no longer work.So far the other headbands appear fine, but we're worried about how long they will last.Its beautiful, but not for big breasted women.These earrings are gorgeous I love them.Beautiful Outfit, but the stitched on bear started ming off after wash...Print on this shirt looks not quality.But the cape made from such a sitff material that it would not go into the shape needed.Cute ring, I wish I uld have worn it.Not actual swim trunks but they are great for splay.They look good at first.It is a solid elastic waistband.I love that they are a thick % tton pant, as I cannot find % tton pants anymore.The zipper works great.Very mfortable and it looks great.Good little bag but strap is tton with leather sewn to one side.It is mfy, but there's not much support.Zero erection ntainment ability.Not enough space for my DD girls.I was hoping for a variety /The material uld be better.was not what i thought it would look it but good enough to keep for a send ringI returned this because I didn't think the quality of the shirt was worth the price.Otherwise, very ol.Needs some alterations.This is definately a unique fashion statement.I think that the wallet should have had some sort of material on both sides to protect cards, other than that it's an ok wallet... it just takes some getting used to.Very thing material.Nothing to do with cashmere.The fabric wasn't too nice.Nice feel.Great material and quality But was small Will return for a bigger sizeDress was see-through.I am weeks and these fall down every few steps.I noticed mine had loose strings by my ankle.Other than that it's a good looking nautical accessory for us beach lovers.But, I didn't realize when I purchased them that they were plastic and I prefer semi precious stones.They are functional and nice looking though.It was well done and the t-shirt was good quality but it was not a maternity shirt.It looks better from the back then the front.Haven't worn it out.just too much dress for me but very well madeNot very mfortable, in my opinion but if you wear them with thick socks they work out.not very well made.Be aware that there is no wrinkle-guard protection in this all-tton shirt.The Dress Is Beautiful, Nice Material And Stretchy.It looks like the picture but isn't a really good quality.Did not like material.Wires were fine, but it is stretchable material.I bought them for my daughter for her cartilage piercings, but they do not work for that.The earrings themselves seem to be made of fine material.This is a really beautiful dress of decent quality and for that reason I give it a three star.Sweet turtle necklace and chain.The item is nice but quality is not.But overall a nice fit and the picture is accurate in lor and form.The tie itself looks lovely and slimmingTied in my favorite eldridge knot, it's stunning and I got many mpliments from my other servers.GREAT productBut that makes sense being as inexpensive as it is.The velcro is strong.Perhaps it met the makers standard of quality?the design is really cuteThey are surprisingly mfortable, easy to walk and dance in.These would work best with a Halloween stume, not for everyday use with cute outfits.The top is a bit big and arrived with a significant crease in one of the cups, that we uld not smooth out by manipulating.nice material.It works very well but I've only had it for a short time and it's already tearing.Great quality only problem is it runs small.This dress would have be amazing but it is a little too thin for me to wear.Very thin material so needs to be much looser to look right.Overall I liked the style.The bill mpartment and the one hidden card mpartment is good.They look nice but are not the best qualityThe material is not as thick as I had thought it would be, but overall very mfortable.Beautiful necklace and good value for the money.The picture is in very good resolution and the backing frame is sturdy and attractive.If the chain was replaced, it would make a good gift for lovers of astronomy or science.Very mfy and soft.I love shirt so much it's so soft and mfortable and stylish, it's such a summary shirt but only it's for winter.But the material is nice, but definitely shear more like tights.I do not like the new fabric they are made with.It's not as pretty in real life.The pictures are much better.Not really a grown-up jewelry.It's OK. To me the fabric or look' is just not as nice as I would like.- My guy doesn't like it at all.Nice, but the tag is on the outside of the shirt mpletely in a random spot.Also the pads are very hard not mfy at allLooks good, not great qualityThe material was as expected.Not what the picture describes but it is good for keeping you warm.It is so loud, a walking billboard of roses.great price...Wallet arrived in a timely manner but the build quality was lacking.It is cute but to big for my tasteI purchased this to use earlier on in my pregnancy with the hopes of extending the use of my non-maternity pants.I gave it stars because it is really cute just wished the stitching had been reinforced more.Others being sold are made in USANot the quality that we thought.I wish it was not on a set chain.Not as deep or stunning as the picture.Nice bouncy material with nice tailoring.clean looking diamonds not yellow and good sparkle.Every foot is different.Not sterling silver... more like silver plated.I do have to say that the material seemed good quality.Still happy with it the price is certainly right.perfectly flat glass in these frames.No nvexity at all.The belt quality is very nice and as expected.My daughter was thrilled with this outfit and so excited to wear itFor the price I expected better quality.I can buy leggings for a lot less that are better made.It is well made but has some flaws when I mpare to others I've owned over the years.Just wish that it was actually a tunic and not a long shirt.beautiful though.Built in bra is not an accurate description It is a shelf bra not really a bra at allThe materials were not that great.Beautiful dressOn the good side the graphic printing was phenomenal.the fabric is kind of thin but for the price it's a good shirt..Good fit, will be used for safety outerwear on nstruction sites.Great price.It is a great jacket for the price.Its good itemIf you're particular amount sock quality, I would avoid these, but if you're indifferent the lors are great and designs are really ol.I had to return them, which was a shame because they were mfy, and looked greatThese are very mfortable but the leg part does not stretch quite enough.Maybe some dried sweat will stiffen up the brim... All in all I would probably try a different brand before I bought this one again, but this one is okay.They definitely look the part, but my goodness they do not breathe at all.Otherwise would be a good shoe.It was made well and the material is what I expected but the sizing is way off.The side lace detail is pretty and very on trend right now.The product seemed to be of good quality.The material is very clingy, meaning that all of your flaws are on full display.Overall, this is a cute shirt and the price is decent, but the material was too clingy and see-through for my liking.Okay quality for price but sleeves where to shortThe foot area fit fine, I felt they needed insoles.The material is soft and the crochet on the back is pretty.I actually wish it was nstructed a little better so I uld actually wear it more.Very stylishThe skirt is well made and really pretty.It is quite shiny though, I feel it made it much fancier than what I was looking for.The material is nice and stretchy and the shirt looks good.The material is okay and it fit well but it's definitely a bathing suit.These are fine for the price.I love this purse and I only have had the purse for over a month.Perfect for no show but slip down off my heel a lotThis is really cute but you only get one so if you want to wear as sandals make sure to order of them.My husband was able to figure out that the handle piece screws into the inside of the purse.Ok but kind of tents out at the chest It looks pretty from a distance and it's really mfortable, but it's shoddily put together with very obvious stitching.Made it work.It's beautiful but I have to get it tailored to fit me.Not my favorite feel.Quality seems good just requires tailoringIt will be a cute ver-up but not the dress I was hoping for.It's a nice scarf especially for the price, but was trying to match a skirt.Looks realistic but not very sturdy.A great buy for the price.Doesn't breath well but it is olThe stitching and material are not high quality.It is worth the price as long as it last through a few months or wear.Fabric is a little thin but its a great undershirt for the priceReally simple product and it looks greatThe suit itself is super cute; the fabric, wonderful.Too clear in the back, needs liningsweater is nice, zipper is not.Super cheap zipper that doesn't work smoothly.Beautiful dress-great material.Otherwise than that it's a great dress.Great quality inn fabricI bought a full slip and it looks wonderfulcute shirt just needs to be made in appropriate sizesLovely gown.They are mfy though and good workout clothes.The charal lor is nice and material is soft.nice qualityThe purses wash and hang dry perfectly.All my other purses from this mpany are fantastic.So far, the smell is still too strong for the purse to be usable.But its ol how it locks.never did get all of the hoops, I tried and finally gave up.This material was different than other palazzo pants I've purchased.Great quality, but tight around the hips.Beautiful design.I love the shirt but if you have a long torso don't buy this shirt.Definitely not a leather smell which I love).Card slots not really nvenient.Excellent quality for it's price.Daughter like it.. but don't seem to be great materialLooks like my Grandpa's PJ top, but it is ol and mfy.Other than the disappointment with the item not being accurately described, they do seem to be made well enough and of a nice weight material.But smoothes out and can't be seen under clothes.Is a nice looking hat to wear at work.She looks great in itThe pendent is very nice, the kitty is freaking adorbs, and it's nstructed well.Be prepared with your own chain.Perfect gift for my Maid of Honor.When I first received the umbrella, I really liked it.I'm not sure how much longer the umbrella will be useful.I think the manufacturer should redesign the seams along the edges to be reinforced for long lasting wear.They look really pretty, wish I uld have worn one.I did manage to wear it to a wedding though and got a lot of mplementsVery reasonable price, ok for a casual shoe.All pieces arrived in great shape without anything broken.The silver added a little bit of bulk and texture while the clear at ensured my fingers would not turn green.The quality of the fabric is not as I expectedIf the light is not shining through them, they are kind of metallic-looking, like the surface is not as clean or clear as I would like.The quality is pretty good sterling silver.More of a crop top than a sweater.It is not the softest material it is more like you would expect in a slightly older baby outfit than most of what you see today.It is not harsh or scratchy on the baby skin but it is not her favorite outfit to wear as it doesn't have the stretch and softness she is usually used to, overall this is a very cute outfit for the price.NOT worth their money for the sand, The send time I wore the green pair the sand burned a hole right throughIndoor use onlyThe winters are very ld and this should add a very mfortable layer around my neck.Great fabric, cut, and feel.The hat itself is of good quality and well built.It's a open weave so be aware of that.It's a cute cardigan, just not very mfortable.If you're a mfort over style kinda person, I wouldn't buy this.This charm is simply ok." I wish I'd held out and paid for the authentic Pandora.Those familiar with the brand name will notice immediately the difference in quality.Nice long length I'm short) I will update if they wear out fast.But the shirts are fine for Saturday projects, camping, or casual days.Quality seems ok.I bought these boots because I love the fringe, but the first pair were somewhat unmfortable to wear and they have not much support.However it is still high quality and nice overallThe material is very strong and can handle the washing machine and the dryer just fine.They looked very nice, but they were supposed to be a pair of clip on rings but were for pierced ears instead.Had to go and buy some adapters to make them work.All in all for the price, I can't mplain, and plan on wearing it as long as it'll stay together.I was expecting a smoother look.The pockets for the cards uld be better, the little liners pulled out easy.Looks goodI actually love the design and the fact that the bra part is sewn in.But the earrings are pretty.Fabric is nice but after wearing them a little while the knees bag.I bought a separate holster and had to rework and restitch it to get it to somewhat fit.nice quality not very stylishThere a little scratchy.Does stuff-down into a pocket well due to its relatively thin material.Also it is thicker material than most out there so it isn't sheer like the ones I have seen.Graphic is not as vibrant as I would like.Jacket is good material.Pretty shirt but in the new clingy" fabric.For those with a perfect figure.The product is excellent.The groove is not deep enough to keep hair ties in place.The bracelet is pretty though, and can be worn as a simple bangle.Otherwise the design is really pretty.Otherwise great bag.These are slippery however I do have silky hair and my caps are always slipping off even the tton ones draw back a little) and even though the lor and appearance is nice, I will return them.nothing great but ok for the priceBut super cute, they had some glitter on it.I might just not like synthetics.The tton is really soft though, and it gotta perfectly acceptably.As others have mentioned the scarf is long and wide but the quality is not very good but the price is a reflection of this.They are soft to the touch and very light.Beautiful and keeping it in my closet as a goal dress.Button accents also look they'll need reinforcing.Made with very delicate scarf material.Very pretty but would not expect to be able to wear it very often.Fits good but it's see through and cheap material.Very cute design.I didn't wear it but it is still a nice top that I know I will get use of..I loved the quality and shoes thoughloved the outfit but the blindfold was see thruThe finish I received is a patina brass lor.It was very cute and the fabric seemed nice.Looks good, should wear well.its good quality.It's very cute but not that well madeIf anything I would give it stars, I only made use of the shirt with high waisted jeans, definitely would buy this a size up.It's priced adequately.The problem was the fabric.The dress is a very high quality gown and was definately worth the .Bought these shades to see how well the classic design would fare on my head before investing in a pair of Ray-Ban Clubmasters.I fell in love with these the moment I took them out of the package.The glasses themselves looked amazing and felt durable, despite the mpletely plastic body maybe even the glass" itself).There is no UV protection whatsoever, so these will do a number on your vision after extended wear.The wrist bracelet feels ok uld not wear /) the necklace is beautiful but just a tad too long and the ankle bracelet was lacking in stones.ComfortableThe undies are well made and soft...not a big fan of ducks or lionsThe materials is tton and not stretchy, so it's not a very flattering fit.This is not a stretchy tank.These are likely the most mfortable pair of pants I've ever put on.Material is good Shipping was greatThe material is great, as is the design.They're lovely to look at... with a magnifying glass.They seem well made.NOT shorts, they are definitely panties"I have a not-so-great photo of my hat, but you see what I mean.This dress us much prettier in the pictured than in person.The material feels heavy as well for a sundress.The blouse itself is very nice...good quality fabric.Nice productThe quality seem great.Also the Art De print looked ol online but I don't love It on in personIt was perfect except for the belt buckle ming undone unexpectedly because it wasn't secure.Nice style.Not the material I expected, but nice shirt to wear with jeansQuality is nice thoughProblems with the way it's put together.I like the soft feel.Felt really good against my penis.Despite odd positions of testicle pouch as well as the legs riding up they seem to feel fine.For the material the fact that this is a two pack, it is really well priced.The box was very lovely and put together.I examined the cage and it was better quality than I expected for the price.I don't expect that all pearls are like mine.It looked a lot like other fresh water pearls I've seen, as it was egg shaped to be expected).Great necklace.Or I am not as endowed as I like to think hahaThe lace is beautiful.Expected a better quality for the high price.Purchased for a wedding and they worked just fine.A few fibers/threads were visible on the seams, and the material is cheap, but for purposes of wearing them just a few times, they worked well.Nice lace, very delicate and soft fabric, just for sexy look.They probably work better for bigger kids/toddlersPackaging and shipping were fineAfter a uple of washes, I managed to get that new-papery feel out of it.I am a little disappointed with the craftsmanship, I do not believe it will hold up for long but I will wear it for as long as it last.I loved the design of this shirt with the cat giving the middle finger when the pocket is pulled down.THey were thicker than I had expected and looked really nice.Nice material but not as dressy as it looks in the picture.Nice but it don't stretch muchVery nice skirt, however zipper did not workproduct did not have silver lining at top.It seems like good quality.It's probably too warm for me to wear in Oct in TX.Couldn't find any thick terry shorts these ones are not nearly as sturdy and well made as the ones I was trying to replace for my husband.That said the materials seemed very durable and well made, I was disappointed that I uldn't wear it since it seemed like a good jacket.This has nice bling on it, is subtle, and is light weight.However the arm holes are baggy at the front, and is not the quality I have found in all the other tops I've bought from Jostar.I would have preferred a more ntained kit since my primary use is when I'm hunting garage sales and stuff tends to float around the car if not nicely ntained.It's mfortable, looks good with other bracelets on my arm....until the hairband falls off the bracelet.The sulcus isn't deep enough to hold the band in place all day as the bracelet slides up and down your arm.I will keep trying to work my way into wearing this longer.I like it .is just not the same fabric .i got a hard different then what it shows on the pictura..but size os good .still like itI love the fabric.Attractive but not mfortable and do not have spring hinges.I was anle to fix it but next time I hope my necklace is a lot stronger...Pretty good quality given the price too.I'm thinking I may need to use lash glue or something to keep it in place the night of the party.I will keep it since I'm running low on time and may embellish it a bit.Its a very light fabric, and it flows nicely.It is simply hemmed there but the same shade as the rest of the ver up.Because of that it doesn't have much dimension and is a little lacking in design.Gappy around the arms doesn't look very goodPleats were not stitched properly.Great looking nice size but after months broke (Thin fabric I ended up having to return due to the size I would have kept them if they fitHad to wear a mpression camisole to smooth out my silhouette.I did not look closely so did not realize they were clip-ons when I bought them.I would not have bought them had I known as clip-ons are prone to falling off getting lost.It's fine for the bachelorette party I got it for but need to work on packaging.I'm '" and the rips are right on my knees which I'm glad for since the pants are a little restricting.I wish they were a bit more stretchy, but I also like how thick they are.The vecro over-extends the Velcro pad if that makes sense?)BUT..the leather and workmanship is outstanding.I would have liked the material softer and have some pliability.No place for cards with personal ingormation.It is lightweight, mfortable, and does not dig into my waist.I had bought this skirt to tie dye in a project with my daughter.When I got them, they looked greatThe white belt still seems intact.Not that long and beautiful in real life.In the picture it looks like a pieces skirt but it is a pieces skirt, but it is still nice.Fabric is a lot cheaper than I thought it would beThe Color bleed on to my clothes but i loved itLove the look tho, has a outdoor appearance but classy.The whole thing would lay better if it were a little less tton and a little more spandex.It's a pretty design, the fabric reminds me of an nightgown.It feels like a nightgownOnly gave stars because st day I used it of the jewels fell out of the side and the zipper for your ncealed carry doesn't want to stay zipped up all the way.The clasp broke send day and had to be sent back but I do love this watch.good and mfortable.Be careful because the lace is more delicate than most.The quality of the product was good.The quality is as expected.The metal is not as shiny as silver, of urse, because it is stainless steel.I love how this sweater looks and the material is a nice quality.I think that these should be cheaper for the qualityComfortable.For the price its a nice top.great material, as all their stuff is, but because of the straps to show the back more it is not very flattering on the front side.But warm.Warm and light, but clumsy and a bit irritating to ear.Not as well nstructed as i thought for the priceNice socks.Good materialMaterial is mfortable but feels like Pajamas not a t-shirt.It is a good quality dress for the price, its just a bit too small.They were good, did the job but when I took them off the lens popped out and I've been unable to get it to stay in place.It's cute the ring is adjustable but the chain is so long... it doesn't look right on.Doesn't look that great.Was not the thickness quality I have bought in the past.It doesn't look as good on me as it does for the model in the picture.Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes.Fabric great, but sleeves a little too long even for / sleeve length.Thank goodness the whole thing is adjustable, but wasn't happy with how it hung on my chest.These leggings are super cute and good quality.Material is great.The material is as specified.I would expect it to mpletely lose its shape or tear in several places if I put it through anything stronger than the EXTREEEEEEEEMELY GENTLE SERIOUSLY YOU SHOULD JUST BE WASHING THIS BY HAND" cycle.Cute, but very fragileFine for the priceSeriously, I lightly pulled on a thread to see if it was at least worth stars, but it smoothly came out.The padding area doesn't give ANY support, my chest was flopping all over the placeBut just like all other reviews, the swimming suit is mfortable and the fabric is soft.The material looks good but the finishings are not so clean.I was expecting a thicker material and has lining inside.This is good for casual wear, not for winter season.fits nice, ordered ivory and it mpletely see through.Quality seems about right plastic, it's what I was expecting).Inside not finished at the quality of the outside.I was very happy with this product upon first getting itThe materials are sturdy and good quality, nothing fancy, basic durable which is what I wantedWell this morning I went to put it on again for day of seasoning.I'm my pictures you can see it's of good quality and looks greatI ordered from here thinking I would get very good quality fabric.I now know that I uld get a much cheaper outfit somewhat like this in a regular department store with much better quality.I love the material and the lor but darn, it just runs too small.Material was goodThe hair look good just don't like the lace.Don't get me wrong the shoe is BEAUTIFULOtherwise fine.softI give three stars, the quality is great so it keeps me extremely interested.Some of which weren't symmetrical.All the others were a love from this mpany and all were very soft and nice, including these.I have found you either need a cute tank underneath, something cute you don;t mind exposing, or a pin of some sort.Quality was what I expected for the price.Really nice and handy, but now on send pair in less than a year as they are not as indestructible as advertised.It was a beautiful dress.It needs a sturdier zipper.Nice if you are nservative.The masks themselves were perfectly fine for price.These shoes were great for my sister in laws wedding, but they have an awful smell that lingers for months even after you air them out.The shoes were fabulous the smell not so much, I would not be purchasing again.I've had better quality with buying the piece tongue rings for like dollars.It feels mfortable on the tongue and it looks pretty nice too.I'm still going to wear it because my tongue is still healing and I wanted to wear a better metal.just received, so deciding if the hard to see hour, minute and send hands will do.FAFADA: use hands' that can be easily seen dark bronze or black)..... a watch with better mechanics and hands would demand a higher price.the design IS good.The price is in line with the material, design, and fit.too much padding, good workmanship.The dress is so cute and very good quality.As for non-skid well, I skidded in them on my wood floor.The material is different than I expected, but decent quality.From the product photos, I expected a looser tton weave.The tag just has an ID number and some Chinese characters, but if I had to guess, I'd say it's more of a poly blend, and a tighter weave.I'm going to use ld water, little detergent, gentle cycle and hang dry as a precaution.The material is not mfortable.This shirt is in dire need of improvement.Not great quality and shipping time was very long.Good quality for sure, but the product runs too large.For the rerd, the plugs are not pretty swirls of lor like stone plugs typically are; the variations in the picture are due to cracks and fissures catching the light.It isn't Pewter.It is BONE lored.Other than it, it is nice and organization is great~This romper is cute but the proportions are off.It's made of good material, but just not for my body type.It's just not great qualityI have only ever bought Carters Foot Jammies, and i thought Gerber would be good to try.Quality nice.Beautiful painted leather and good size for carrying wallet, toiletries, and everyday needs.It's flocked and things catch/ don't slide in or out easily when reaching into the bag.The bag is lovely to look at, but lining doesn't hold up.Not sure they'll last too long being worn every day.It holds every thing I need.Not that I can't see it, but other than that it was nice:) there's a little rubber lining to keep the deep v in place.The fabric is true to the online picture.But the prink is fun and I like that part of it, the fabric has a nice feel and I like that part of the product.But it's a fun" top and I will wear it.The fabric is soft, and the lor is true to the picture.It's a cute top.Still a cute top but not for the price.These kind of glasses looks perfect but when wearing them the glass keeps ming out it takes time to go fixing them.The hearts themselves are nice and rather simple, I bought this as a random gift for my wife, she loves itGetting it on a better chain and it'll be even better.Overall, I'm satisfied with the marled look and I like thinner socks for summer rainstorms, but I did wish they had a stronger elastic band to stay up.Simple jacket.It rides up enough where it can be mistaken for a thong.BUT with Matt lipstickOn it looks good.It is cute, and it will work for what I bought it for.They are mfy and fit nicely with beautiful layering under my shirts.These are very cute socksFor me they don't quite work out how I'd like.They are nice quality socks thoughthe fabric of the dress is not the best quality.They looked good.It is very cute and stylish.I can wear it around the house or as a beach verup.The only reason why I gave it three stars is due to the quality of it.It's imported from china, so it is not a authentic Greek hat.It looks better in person, then in the picture shown.Excellent for the price, delivery great, but very thin material and reflects the priceHorrible beyond horrible and definitely not a Simply Southern shirtThe material has absolutely no give, so if you have a larger chest or butt do not purchase this dress.Wish straps were adjustable.It would offer better support.Pretty light weight, but what I expected for the low st.The design was well done, no fading or weird lors, exactly what it looks like.very mfortable, nice sweater for a hang around the house.Good cheap SUNGLASSESIt worked well on her wrist.See-through and they're not genuine leggings.It looked nice and was very functional I had several cards it has adequate slots) and my phone inside along with some cash, receipts, and change.It's a cheap wallet that looks nice so just go into buying this knowing that fact.Hoping little look better after it's been worn a while.The weathering is done well.Very different fabrics and not sewn very well to nnect the bodice to the body.This is a great product provides good support after a c-section.I am days post surgery and I almost have the velcro maxed out.It is cute and mfy.This purse is beautiful.HAD TO LAYER IT.Not quite sure of level of mpression, but they are very well made.It is very heavy, well made garment, but not for my needs in a hot humid climate.The material is mfy and doesn't show any signs of being endurable.Overall the shirt is good for it's price and everything else seems to be in top shape.Not high quality, but it was the only Mother-Son heart I uld find that fits my wife's Pandora bracelet.Both Vitamin A and Runway Swimware.Great customer service..But on, it doesn't look as sexy as in the photo.The band itself is very smooth and has a good weight to it that makes it feel a lot more expensive than it is.On the flip side, at the end of the week, the k band had noticeable scratches, whereas this ring still looked brand new.Obviously the ring itself is of reasonable quality, so it may just be that whatever chemical is used in the rose gold plating doesn't work with my body chemistry.The one with two bands: this ring bottom) and k rose gold top); the two rings were worn for the exact same amount of time received the one with diamonds for Christmas together.Tungsten carbide for the win right there.I bought other socks and the ones made with a softer material tend to stay up on my thigh better.Good quality for the priceThe fabric is awesome, but just a weird fit for me.i bought pair as gifts) and when i received them all three pair were slightly melted together where the music notes are.i lightly pulled them apart and they separated fine without damaging.i don't know why they were stuck together and if it was because of the heat during the shipping process but it makes me worry about the care" process.Love material and design no problems with product made and price good to purchase.It's cute for the price but wonder if I will wear it that often.I love the thumb-holes and is a different, nice fall look.It seems well-made, otherwise and isn't see through material.It protects but it fogs up easily.The chain broke once I got it but it's good quality.Quite small and not the best quality, but decent price.too loose on a baby to mark it is for - month babyI loved the look and everythingFor the extremely cheap price I was fine with just sewing it to make it better but had it been more expensive I wouldn't remmend.It hides my tummy well, but the material is too light.If it was lined or made from a thicker material, I would give it a -star rating.Nicely designed Beautiful fabric Order one size up I wear mine backwards and this opens the bust area Viola People mplain cause they use poor judgement If you like it buy it It'll look goodI took good care of them and kept them in the case but they still ended up scratching very easily.I loved the look of this shoe but when I tried it on, it was too high to wear mfortably and the weight of it made it kind of clunky" and noisy when you walk.I uld probably adapt to the height, but not the noise.It was a great quality shoe with a unique look, but it won't work for me.The top doesn't ver ANYTHINGNot enough verage for anyone with the slightest bit of a chestGave stars because it is made of good quality material.Other than that the angle of the shoe/heel seems mfortable, and if you get the right size I would imagine they'd work great.Cute very shiny but tangles easilyThe price is very high.If felt pretty and that I stood out in the crowd.If you need to wear full body shape wear underneath then you'll have to have the top of the dress lined.I felt pretty, but I was HOT.The material is not suitable for hot climates or the summer time The train is way too long The sew in cups are cream lored and NOT suitable for people with darker mplexion.It is great for people who are mfortable with the style.Light materialOtherwise, the top is nice.Dress is ok. Kinda small and fabric is kinda thin and doesn't hold its shape up top as well as I'd hope.For the right body this uld be a five star dress and for other types a for quality and price Definitely looks nicer than a - dollar dress It is not itchy it is sheer and lightweight perfect for the spring or summer but too light for the fall maternity wear would have been great for this also Because it flows and has a lot of room and material in the middle And the fabric was soft.But for the price it was expected.I like them for the price but don't expect them to be picture perfect.This is a sturdy fabric bag that has enough room and pockets.The material is mfortable, but also VERY thin see through in the sunlight).Soft and nice but slim cutshortness aside, I really like the material, its soft and mfortable, and waist wise the fit is great.I was satisfied with the quality, lor, fabric, etc.It's good but fabric is thick and heavy.But I will still wear it on a ld NY evening by the fire.Quality of product is very good.Looks and feels identical to a much more expensive version.The lor was perfect and the material is nice.I would've liked a little better padding in the chest area" did I mention lbs?Same as picture and great quality the only reason stars is because it was too small.Otherwise, I love it )There were some surprise glow in the dark balls.She can wear both perfectly.The waist band is fine, but the buckleNice design, not the highest quality.It's sewn adequately, it feels handmade which is fine, I just don't think the material is the best quality.Nice for casual outings, nothing elegantQuality of shirt is fine.I loved the way it looked, my daughter wanted a ankle length dress to wear for a wedding and this was perfect.I have had to put it back together within an hour of the first wear.There are multiple levels of chains, which I personally enjoy that look.The leaves are also very pretty.I liked the necklaces overall, however; I am not sure what the chain/string part is made of but when you shower with it, the water turns black.Excellent design and mfortable to wear, more so for those who cannot wear wrist accesories or feel unmfortable wearing siline bands.The materials are pretty good and seem sturdy enough, plus there are no edges to scratch you with.I will attach to my shoelaces next and I expect that will make it very accurate.Pretty dress but the material wasn't what I was looking for.I'm rating based on fit/material.ComfortableI has hoping for a tton blend/more of a casual look.It works like a charm to lace it.Very soft metal.Good qualityIt's a very pretty umbrella.I find them quite warm..The fabric was looser than that of other Sanuk sandals, making them feel too big.The fabric was nice.The fabric and lace are nice quality.Year one no problem where mfortable but a little cloudy.If I remember right they were very inexpensive We liked the heaviness of the fabric for winter wear.Good quality materialThis is not stretchable but it's okay, very shiny and the heart adds another dimension of beauty and rarity to a standard anklet.It's cute, but the material is not the best.It wasn't the quality as I expectedNice jumpsuit but I would not remmend to any taller women.Its beautiful not what is in the picture but still love itGood quality but the size chart is not accurate.The umbrella was exactly the one we had on mind and wanted.I had to take multiple paper towels with soap and water to remove the film of dust before letting my son touch it.I love the design itself however I'm not loving the material at all.Shirt material is nothing special, fits as expected.Material is soft but the elbow pads do not align with your elbows..wasn't impressed with the qualityDidn't look exactly like I would have wanted, still have to get in altered but prettyFabric is good and quality made.Nicely made, pattern is just too loud for me.Good replicaThe dress is quite loose on me but it still looks fine, I gave it away to my sister tho since she fits it betterthe material is great tho and it looks amazing on her.Seemed to be good quality sewing.The belt does not have any interior structure or support.It is very mfortable but the cut was not what I expected.Real pretty but a little too sheer for meBetter quality then some of the others, but for the price, can't beat it.The detail is gorgeous but I'm just not head over heels in love with this.The fit is good and overall it is a nice ring, although my ring chipped within the first week I had it.The black stainless is nice.The screw backs were cumbersome and took a good deal of twisting to get them secure.The fabric is sheer, the sizing chart is not accurate.I decided to give this product a nstructive criticism.After working with it awhile it can be softened up and shaped nicely.Don't get me wrong, this is a beautiful scarf for a very good price.I will try to make some kind of adjustment because it is too beautiful to just sit in a drawer.Easy repair, if you have the patience.She wore one for less than weeks and it broke.This product was fine after a uple of weeks it didn't stick or hold like it did.The shoes are nice and mfy for my son but I did not get them in time for our vacation in Colorado.These will not fit my son next year and our weather in Houston is too warm to even wear these in winter.The wallets ability to block RFID scanning is questionable as I have many key cards for building access that work without removing them from the wallet.Having said all this, for the price its a good minimalist wallet.looks exactly like the picture but the hanging strings are very unorganized and some were missing beads and the fit seemed a little funkey around my breasts, otherwise very mfySuper soft, good quality silk screen.The verage is good but it certainly doesn't puddle on the floor.Its still not soft but I hope it will do.The lime green bottoms were a little thin and see thru when wet.Well, the price is okay for what it is but the disappointment factor is fairly high; if the seam were right and they were baggy, this would be a bargain.The cups don't extend down low enough so when I tightened the straps the cups were higher than my breasts and when loosened the cups didn't give enough support.It's adorable and great quality but it's Asian sizing so it runs small.I mean, I can get in it, but it isn't super mfortable.It slid on with relative ease but did nothing to smooth out anything.Other than that it was super cute and good materialBeing polyester, despite its very thin wispy nature, it seems to retain heat.It's not as ol as a normal tank top, temperature wise.Like most clothes in this price range and especially of this cloth type, I worry about durability.Hand wash or get a very fine mesh lingerie bag for best results.If you like fleece, its great.I love this bathing suit but... the top has no support or padding at all.The bottom part has good verage and is super cute.Very nice looking in person, a nice silky fabric.I don't like the fabric.It has a polly-rayon-lycria feel to it.Plastic gems but nice.I did not liked the qualityAs a result, I have some ruching in the back, but still very cute and it fits well.Cut short and its made from tee shirt material not of great quality.They are well made but on me they were just too loose for the pool.The lining was soft and classy looking.The material is not very forgiving.I thought it looked like it would be flow-y and mfortable but it is more tight fitting.Pretty rings.But the diamonds are easy to loose and hard to screw in.Its mfortable to use daily.Otherwise, good for the price.i accidently rated this item I haven' received yet, but I received the ties yesterday and it's awesome.I love this as a sun safety product, but it's not strong.BUT, they look great with the stume with the right tweakingThis necklace is not very durable.In fact, it should be handled gently.Very soft, was used as a Max from Where the Wild Things Are Costume and he enjoys wearing it very much.otherwise, held sweat fairly well for the workout I did and received a lot of mpliments on the ol lor and print.Cute dress if you have the right figure for it.I rate stars only because of the quality, I uld spend dollars for something better for sure.Hopefully I will use it for a long time.Pros: Keeps your face warm.It's super zy and my daughter loves it anyway but I just wish I had gotten what I ordered )I have several dresses in this style that I have to pin, which is fine most of the time.Great for the price they did rip easy had to buy moreIt's a spandex silky material.It's a little see through but the top is very cute and it's definitely eye catching.Cute bag, The inside zipper ripped the first day but the bag itself is adorable and well madedone't look as good in person then it does in the picture.it's not itchy and it's mfortable so starsSuper warm but really oversized.She was specifically looking for a top to go with her existing mermaid swimtail.The fabric has a subtle scale print, which is pretty.Overall, my daughter loves it, I was luke-warm about it, the price was reasonable.i received my bracelet about a week back...it looked beautiful and very dainty.The shipping and packaging was very cuteVery good for quick reading in sunlight.That said they are gorgeous and nicely made.Decent hat for the price.I was hoping the lacing would be adjustable, but it isn't.Work out for me nice lookIt was good quality just the size chart is not accurate so be wary of size differencesIt is not so warm as I expected.Not quite what I was expecting but still nice for the priceThe tap shoes are good quality leather, so I'm going to keep them and use shoe stretchers.Otherwise good product.The material is NOT summer casual material.You would get hot and sweaty in this in a heartbeat.Its think and not breathable at all.These are so beautiful.Overall, the shirt is nice, although the decal on the front is definitely made from a material that is not as durable.I've been using a ld wash and air dry without heat and it seems fine.The shirt uld be improved, but equally people need to know how to wash it.So this feels really well made.Padding is really firm.I take them out, and the bra is not very supportive, but if I leave them in, there is plenty of room to slide left and right, and little to keep them in place.I think if the actual material of the bra was more supportive, it would have been much nicer.For a stume piece, this worked well but it can't be tied as tight as it needs to go for smaller people.In reality the wlneck was vering the sequins way more.Maybe with the right top it wouldn't matter, but If a piece can't stand still on it's own I won't keep it in my llection.I painted over the elephant head ONLY with clear nail polish before wearing it So the lor didn't fade BUT it's too short for my piercing.A bit pricey for such a basic dress.I wish both dresses were made with the same fabricThe ones that were made properly work great though, so I'm giving stars.I will be returning it because I don't like that there isn't much movement in the fabric, but that is only a personal preference of mine.Nice hat but had a seam ming apart right out of the package.the material was soft.Material is see-through.I really love this bracelet and what it stands for.I thought I would take the time to give some good feed back on this product.Upon its arrival it is beautiful band the texture of the band is great.I loved that all you had to do was brush the band and it looked like brand new again.This band is designed for a dress watch you will get the best longevity from it.But this is do to how I wore my watch not the durability or quality of the band.The finish wore quickly on the black version I ordered.Cute and stylish bag.Fur is not as Fluffy as others but still a nice boot.It was absolutely beautiful and I got so many mpliments on it.. but the stones fell out.They arrived made of a pper/brass lor I wouldn't remmend if you are looking for surgical steel.They get better with age as the exposed pper patinasThe fabric is a bit shiny for my taste.Really cute pattern and mfortable fit, but see through.Not the material I was hoping for.Was hoping for more of the Stance" brand sock material.I thought it would be a sweater, it was woven jersey fabric, too casual for the office.In any case, the tton shirt is fine but it is nothing more than a variety.The tton isn't soft and thus it doesn't feel great to wear.I bought it for the ol print but I think the mpany uld have spent more on quality tton shirts.Good price and fits newborn babies well, but fabric does not hold up very wellLace area see through online photo of product does not accurately show this.They are so cute but had to give stars due to the quality.The lace which is the cutest part) doesn't have any give, so order acrdingly.They don't have the best arch support so if you have naturally high arches like I do you may want to invest in some good arch supports.These are a little pricey, I've seen less expensive, but they are cute shoes so we'll see how well they wash and wear.The hat was very stylish and very well made, but too small for my head.It's too late to exchange it but it is a beautiful shirt and tie.So if you want loud and in your face gold glittery shoes, then these are for you.Luckily these are all fixable issues by way of sewing but it shouldn't have to be that way It's a very cute little scarf.I washed it and it held up well.It is a very mfortable dress and works well for the office.I needed a fabric for my pants that is soft, as I have sensitive skin.I return these pants because they were too large and fabric was not soft enough for my needs.Quality is good and they seem very warm.Cute- but looked better on the model in the pictureOther than size it has a liner and the trim is not mfortable and not well attached.Very cute nose rings.I think hitting them with a stch brite pad or ceramic bead blaster will give a more subtle finish.Nevertheless, if you are looking for a shiny, high polished clip, these are a good value.I received the shirt yesterday and immediately wanted to try it on, as it did fit as it was supposed to, I was surprised that it was printed on a fruit of the loom shirt.Very short and the quality isn't the best, though its a beautiful dressThis top is soft and mfortable but it is literally a piece of material with two strips of elastic.Can't find a canvas belt with real leatherI had mine tailored before it was shipped.It is stunning and I've had many mpliment on it.Also, if you like the feel and wash of tton this top feels too polyestery and pills after washing.Very beautiful at first glance, but not very sturdyIt's light not heavy at all.but it still looks great if you're just wearing it to hang out with friends, not too much movement or activity.Its what I expected for the price... Not sure how long itll hold up but it is soft and functional enoughit's pricey for the weight of the favric.It looked cute when she tried it on but she hasn't worn it sinceSo, that tells me the fabric isn't high quality or durable.good quality but not the fit I hoped for.But the material it's soft and the llor it's cute.Looks very stylish and fits well but made poorly.The material feels silky.unfortunately the leather" has already worn off in several places.The fabric is pretty good but wish it uld be better.Okay for the price overall.It is very light and I think it would be easy to travel with.Inexpensive and looks it.It is ok for that price and if you just want to wear it at the beach.These stockings are sexy and beautiful but they run big and long.It's good quality though.It's more of an elastic lingerie material.Loved the dress but the material was a no good.Nothing crazy, but a little loose.Cute but not really a good materialSo you have this gorgeous tree and bird and then place your text here"?Purely derativeThe straps won't stay in place, the buckle doesn't close properly.For this price I expected a much better quality.No leather.Other than the above issues, they are definitely bad-ass and I wear them on occasion.An adult can not wear thisOver all not as cute as it looks in the photo or as mfortable.i don't like the materialDoes not go over my knee, but works with my air cast.This looks like a Pajama Top.I feel like it adds lbs.Color is good, don't fade in warm wash and don't shrink.Cute but a lot more see through than expectedNice silky tton, I didn't wear it on a beach but I uld see how it would be absorbent and helpful in that setting.There are no real sleeves to speak of.That being the case, it tends to slide down my shoulders and doesn't do a great job of vering my backside.Also around the chest area is not as well tailored as picture.the pads don't stay in place.Only reason I am giving stars is because it is definitely NOT steel-boned.Foundation is plastic, but still sturdy.Not steel boned.They would be more mfortable.It is more peachy than pink and I am a winter, so it doesn't look that good on me.I'll just wear it around the house on hot days when I want to look okay and be mfortable.Otherwise it was fine and a good value.The material was fine, the loring was nice, the length was as expected, But it is more like a size /.Quality of the material isn't that great, but you get what you pay for.I also got a passport holder from the same manufacturer and its quality seems to be okay.Not as quality as the image shows, be sure to always read dimensions.Attention to detail was needed with this item.They are fine for the price.It certainly gives me an hour glass figure.Kinda small, and wish it was better qualityIt mes well above the knee which doesn't make it very period rrect -) for what I was wanting.The material is lightweight Cute dress but don't know if I will ever wear it.The quality is decent and is exactly as pictured.At standing everything is good, but movement and you got some loose flying gals.I love the fabric it is so smooth and mfortable, really a great weight.The shirt is beatiful but fit a little crocked but it still a great but for the price.The chain broke after a year of nstant use, but the metal was repairable with a little bit of work on it.Please note: I sat the bag outside in fresh air for days straight and the smell is STILL not gone.Very pretty dress, but not as stunning as I had anticipated.Nice silky material and it fit perfectly.I uld have made this myself honestly.the front looks perfect and adorable.The quality is okay but the sleeves are tight so pushing them up isn't really an option.Love this...very mfortable..a tad thin..great as a dress or as a top with leggingsLove the skirt, but the shirt is very sheer and see thru.I unfortunately had to return them because right when I opened them the finger hole was ripped off of the wings but I loved them they were so cute wish they were a little more sturdy Nice design but very thin and not worth putting out side.Ink work on mat is nicely done with no flaking so far after three months of use.This bolo tie is beautiful minus the rd it is on.And the rd is also not leather.I had high hopes for this dress, but sadly it wasn't up to the same quality as the Homeyee dress I ordered at the same time.Worked great the first few times, however now the lights are very dim.I love how the make my butt look and feel.What I wasn't in love with was the bra pads that moved around a lot.But the lace is a lovely pattern.I want expecting a whole lot for the price, but I was expecting a little better...Very pretty dress, but does not give" at all.Shirt is decent quality, lor is true to picture.The crochet on mine is bright white and not off-white like I thought.Material is nice but the way it was packed made it wrinkled.It can get really hot and heavy.It's cute but the sleeves aren't long enoughAs far as if the stones will stay sparkly, only time will tell.It was a good fit but tarnishes easilySee thru but cute.Material is iffyThey're mfortable and fit perfect.The material is gorgeous and vintage looking, but the size XS is huge.I will say shipping was very fast and the shirt is soft.the dress is beautiful though.beautiful dress in the picture not so beautiful on.The assembly and material of this outfit would not be suitable as something I would expect to endure day to day usage.I just wish each piece was a little better made.There are two main aspects to sock suspenders: the elasticity of the strap that goes around your leg, and the strength and ease of use of the clip that attaches to the sock.The elastic strap is tight and well made.Quality is great though.Shipped back quality wasn't that greatBought these to use in place of a bra.They seem like they'd be durable, but I wasn't able to wear them long enough to give an honest review on that aspect.The design of this case is my favorite part.The flip portion of the case does not work very well and you can only put card OR money in.The website says % polyester and % tton, but I feel there is lycra added ..If i didn't have that muffin top and my gut overhang a bit, it would fit nice.It's a material I would expect for a workout shirt and fits tight.It did the trick but wasn't the most nvenient.Capacity is reasonable.Overall for the money it is OK but I isn't going to meet my needs.VERY thin;but on a hot humid day...it will feel GREATI was disappointed in the lace edging, it does not stay up well but wants to roll.This dress is lovely, but there are a few drawbacks to it.The shirt is very nice but the material is very thin.Band adjustment took some muscle and finesse.The fit is great but the material itself is not mfortable mpared to the other Elan Tunics I own.It's more scratchy to be honest but I do luv the lor scheme.I only give stars b/c of the feel of the materialThe stume look so much nicer on the picture.It holds my hair ties perfectly thoughThey're a good lor and decently opaque, but they're not very elastic.If I was taller maybe this wouldn't happen, but I still think they uld be tighter/stretchier, like some higher-quality tights.Good shirt for the price.The product itself is fine.I only got one g plug and the back of the g tunnel broke in half while I was wearing it but these are great they do what they need to.Was not very well made.nice necklace.Good material thoughI'm on the lookout for breezy pants to wear for the summer as I work in the southwest, and I thought this would do the trick.The prints are fun and bright, and I wish they would have fit.Very cute necklace.Fits nicely and it's mfortable, but since there's no tacky strip along the hem, it does roll up some.The material was okay.Material is thick and strong.It does not appear to be the quality fabric she would like so I will find someone else to give it to.Seems to be made well can't beat the price.Very expensive but I love the lorIt looks more better and bright on Amazon.Its not the best quality but its really cute and the price is a plusSuper cute shirt, not the best of quality.I love the ring.the plating wore off the first day I wore it but it didn't turn green so I'm still wearing itVery cute and decent material but i remmend going up a size.Unfortunately, I didn't look through the reviews for this underwear before purchasing because I figured it would be difficult to mess up underwear.The stickiness of the product is good.There are gaps on the sticky lining allowing your skin to breathe which is pretty nice.This bra does the job, but I wouldn't buy another.Material wasn't what what expected, however the item fits cuteDidn't like it quality wasn't what I expected.The material seems sturdy, but as expected, the pockets are not deep and spacious.It's not like I'm going to exercise in it, but still not perfect.Average jacket for a good price.It's not made of the jeans material I am used to, but its lightness is okay for the summer months.I love the loring.But for the price they work Pretty dress for the price runs big on the topLooks almost like it has been folded in the package and exposed to sunlight or bright light.I thought it was just from being folded since it was wrinkled with creases, so I washed it and it doesn't look any better.Really cute, very sexy bikini.I only got pieces and they were only tongue bars, belly bars, eyebrow bars, and lip labret retainers.The shirt itself is a lovely cut and the size was true and it looked to be well made but it is mpletely see through.Its just too sheer to wear to work which is what I bought it for.But the under-wire fits rrectly and it's pretty modest.Water gets through to clothes, its waterproof-not water resistant.Only for mild rain.Otherwise, it's beautiful, but not worth .I loved the bracelet but the engraving was so light you uld barely read it.Its a little large, material isn't heavy, but of urse I live in Texas....you don't want anything heavy in the summer.Good quality, especially for white, but the torso is really short.Shirt is as expected, but printing quality isn't top notch.Quite see throughWill be very cute on head with less volume hair.Prettier in the picture, quality less than I expected in person.The tank top is made of a very soft, delicate fabric.I like it, but it seems more appropriate for sleepwear than outerware, and I had hoped it to also be longer.It great as an undergarment.Not very durable.(Depending on the time of month) C also depending on the time of month haha) The fabric was lovely and true to the pictures.Has a beautiful shimmer to it.It's pretty thin fabric, but in a nice way... like it would dry fast and you wouldn't be all moist for ages.Straps are nice and thick and for those with chests we know is a plus.The foam inserts are very small so you might want to switch them out for larger ones from one of your dresses or other swimtops to avoid that awkward circle outline on the chestal region.My legs are fairly cushiony but the thigh holes seemed just fine.I hate to pass up a shimmer suit with such a mfy neck strap.Too hot layers of fabricThe zipper is not well made so we are not going to mess with it for fear of it braking before the wedding.The lace and look of the dress is beautiful, very soft and fits well if you order it bigger then your usual size.the crochet uld have been stretchy it would have helped.This product is actually good quality, but it is rough on the skin from outside.I love Henley neck shirts.The tton was soft and not scratchy which is another plus, upon receiving it, of urse I had to wash it.This looks beautiful, however very delicate.its a good way to add detail top an outfit.But the shirt itself is a great shirt design and overall quality is decent.Well made but not all of it fit.okay, but not as authentic looking as I antipicatedThe gen in my ring was NOT aquamarine but rather a plain clear diamond.I agree with the other review on here that this dress has some major differences from the photos shown.Cute and inexpensive purse I bought to kick around the last weeks of summer.It's cute but not well made.The thing is that I feel like after a uple washes it starts to stretch and it isn't the same, but the lor is very nice and its very mfortable.I wore the necklace because it worked well with my dress, and the stone part of it in the front is nice, but the gold part on the chain is badly tarnished.It looks bigger in the picture.It's a beautiful dress and it's hard to find beautiful maternity for high end work environment but I it's small and there is absolutely no room for growing belly Unfortunately I ll wear it maybe more weeks than its too tight And, if you plan on wearing inside, as I do, working at a mputer/typing with big zippers on your wrists is not fun.Unexpectedly cuteVery stretchy and mfy.Cute top, and I love the cat detail.Big rim, sturdy, looks a big fancier than just a beach ir gardening hat.A lot heavier material and is warm.Definitely good qualitygood ver up for the priceI'm not impressed with the quality.I bought this for my vacation, it packs wrinklesBe prepared to iron it.the product was fineKeeps my head warm.Otherwise they seem very well made with thick, hefty fabric and reinforced functional pockets, sturdy drawstrings around the ankles, etc.Unfortunately, because of the material I was only able to keep it for months before it started to fall apart.Prettier in pictureHeavier Cotton but Great for the Price.Quality is good, but not great.They are, however, very soft and zy.For the price, the earrings are okay.There was no support up top at all.High chance of having a wardrobe malfunction (I got these for my daughter who has snake bits and does cheer.The bodice is a velvety material and has some stretch and structure to it, but I noticed other reviews mention a zipper.The skirt is cute, a shiny blue material with gold stars, not much else to say about that.The belt would be better with a little stretch to it or some elastic in the back.Head piece: will work just fineThe Velcro fasteners are a little scratchy on my neck, but it's a stume, so I expect a little Velcro here and there.Thankfully, the cape helps to hide some of the imperfections of the bodice.I washed it on ld and inside out.they are nice but very unnfortable for me to wear.good quality but unforunately didn't fitThis is a nice piece but I must say it looks like granny panties.It is a little thin and see through, but other than that I love it.It is polyester and is not as long as picture but I've ended up really liking it it is light weight and zyIt is too tight on top and probably would be too hot, since it is made of jersey.It looks so pretty on the model and perhaps someone else would think this was a great purchase.The picture is a little blury, but I still like them ok and wear them every once in a while.I like that is very breathable.Great customer service.A very nice swim suit, however, it uld use a little more stretch in the fabric.nice material .. would order againWould have wore them all the time, as I love the little bit of sparkle they add.Leather smells even after sitting out for months.The material is not T-shirt or sweater material, it's different but mfyI should have sprung for a more expensive fez.Fits fine, washes well, mfortable.they are cute shoes I bought three different lors they do stretch out quite a bit which I don't like if you don't need to walk far cute shoeStyle is fine, and the material makes it look flattering.Comfy and looks cute.This item does not tuck as well As I imagined.I bought this product last Christmas I spent with my sister but the perse broke the first few weeks she was using it the wallet is still OK I felt embarest for I thought it would have a stronger nstruction.I was surprised the the jewelry was gold and stones, I really needed silver and stones.Not very sharp when cutting thru gauze and doing dressing changes.I got this for my friend and the handcuffs don't look like hand cuffs but the thought it was unted so she liked itTwo of them are piece design and one is one piece design.The position is too high and the fabric is too smooth and it keeps sliding away from my finger tips.I find the padding slightly bigger than the available area.- Waist: as this is a piece design, these is not really waist area, the dress is " wide after the bra cups.Features that I like: Flexible piece design is great if you need a smaller or bigger bottom.It is really mfortable.Actually, it gives great support.It is good for someone want excellent support for their big headlights.Wasn't the material I was expecting.I gave it three stars because it was inexpensive, and I can still wear it at our pool here at home when I'm just hanging out by myself.But good quality.Disposable but only needed for Gasparilla so it served it's purpose.These have very mfortable material.The quality of the vest is good.To light to hangVery good quality, but I had to return because it was too small.But it's a really cute skirt.I love the front looks, not too much in the back...But overall it is kinda unique and my daughter got a lot of mpliments.I do wish that the words and image were of a higher quality, very thinly applied and the t shirt fabric shows through.Note: Be sure you are threading these the rrect wayquality uld be a bit betterThinner material than I expected, but still good.These are mfy but the Dark Heather lor is see through.The wood itself is brilliant.The magnate clasp/attachment is nothing to be desired.The ankle straps helped keep them on my daughter, but they were very floppy on her feet.Other than the printer boo boo which they rrected) it was a great product, fit well and they provided good customer service.(He didn't mind as much as I did that the printing was fuzzy.Good quality material but doesn't quite fit well.The quality is good and it's not a see-through.Alterations can help.I did not really like the quality.It's a beautiful ring I received so many mpliments the lor did change thoughI'm only giving it stars because I like the soft but material and it is a cute dress.The skirt was good quality, came with its needed lining, and true to the lor as depicted.Nice stretch but I'm a little worried about washing.This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my adult daughter who is very petite.Looks so good onPerfect for the priceBut beautiful shirt,Material not the best.I'm hoping to loose weightVery cute loved itIt is warm and shirt is good quality, but would not remmend simply because it peels.Otherwise I like how soft it is and how long the strings are to tie it.The fabric is thick and soft, probably more suited for fall than spring or summer.I uldn't find a tag on the dress that provided the fabric mposition, but I think it might be more polyester than tton.Cosmetically, the jacket is great.The dress is nicely nstructed.Top was nice, thick material so nothing would show through, even on darker skin tone.perfect for what I needThese boots are warm and fuzzy inside.They feel lightweight-great for toddlersI had to bend the latch to get it to work properly, but other than that it seems to work well.But if you're just using them for splay, they work just fine especially for that pricelooks greatThis is a huge shirt.Love the fabricGuess you get what you pay for quality of the fabric wasn't that good but it's good for the price.Great design, material is a little thinner than expected.No room to grow in this .this is really short and unfortunately the lining is a lot shorter but good lor and nice fabricIt work well for cutting it apart an pinning it in my daughters hair, as an hair accessory Doesn't shade the sun, for style and looking ol only.Love the suit, great quality, how ever if you are a D cup or larger top won't ver.This too from the same mpany was a very mfortable fit, a great summer and lazy day dress but the ties tore in just a few washesThis is a really cute nursing bra and fit as expected, but my boobs keep falling out of the cups, which defeats the purpose of wearing a bra.Great material and quality.Stretchy fitted material.If you are looking for a spandex feeling this is great.Not real real binding but holds you together.Good quality but runs small.Absolutely gorgeous.Ok for teen that will outgrow fast..not high quality but goid enough for price paidThe quality of the rhinestones on these earrings are absolutely beautiful.A lot of their jewelry is absolutely gorgeous, I am hesitant to do any further purchases with Ever Faith.it's ok for the price, didn't have the room i needed to put my stuff in.very pretty and good value however too small to work on most tablesFabric is not the best.It's not very flattering on my pear-shaped figure.The shiny material that the cape, skirt, and boot vers are made of don't ship well.Super nice knit but the side seaming is wonky.It doesn't lay smooth.It may get some use this winter.For the price, the gift set appears to be of great quality.It is definitely a handsome set.This probably looks awesome on someone with a slender figure.The sleeves are a bit too puffy for my taste, a bit more than the photo shows.Looks better in the pictures than in actuality.Okay sweater for keeping on the back of your chair at work.I know it is a precious stone, but it looks good.I thought they would have been more mfortable.The posts aren't mounted straight, so getting this thing straight on a uniform is a bit of a trick.It would look good if you had bigger chest or implants otherwise will make you look oddly flat chested no matter what you do with it.The mix of materials give it a great feel.It is very light and if mine weren't too small, I believe it would be very airy as well.Fabric is very stretchy and it is a very cute romper but was short in the legs to where I can where it because my butt will show, very cute with a long cardiganIt's a pretty design though, and it's made of thick stretchy synthetic fabric probably, not ideal for a hot summer).Hip and stylish harem capri pants.Thick thighs beware.and it easy to flip over so the sparks side won't always shown.They're very soft and a thin, light material.I got them to lounge around in at home and they're perfect for that.Doesn't look or feel sturdy.Good for having in a fixed place.It's okay, the weaving uld be better.Love these but they are mpletely see through.Having purchased this gown for a gift, I was willing to pay the price for organic and quality.It is rrect that the gown is very soft as described.I might have kept it anyway since it was so affordable and was very lovely, high quality, but the zipper was broken out of the package.It is also very soft, and the heart is nicely embossed.It is much better quality than similar shirts I have purchased for twice as much.This is an excellent value, and I plan to wear it often out and about running errands and for working out in oler weather.Cute shoes for a good price though.The fabric is good.Looks great but not very durable, one drop and that was the end of that for me...These are fair glassesOur grand daughter truelly loved it but was heart broken on Christmas day when the zipper was broken as recieved.They seem to be great quality, but the sizing is WAY off.The buckle was too mplicated for my husband.These shoes look good in person.If your wearing a catchy fabric over these its going to ride up on this non-smooth material.There is extra padding in the front as well as the back.These aren't to be used as a diaper so they will still make the pants wet but a better than the normal" underwear.Some of the rings already came turned tarnished and the rest were good.But i love the way it feels, it came in on time and i believe a few days early.Cute summer dress.Better as beach ver up.haven't tried it yet but looks nice and true to the picture.The mb is great at holding the veil in your hair.The body of the stume was super stretchy and loose it was mfy but it didn't look as cute as I wanted it too.Nice soft fabric if somewhat thin.Good quality cute style wish it fitI still have some ncerns on the fine details of the at"; a friend of mine is using it; he's smaller than me; we'll see if anything goes wrong.Good for summer and not too expensiveI think it's a great dress, it's just not the cut for my body.Quality is not that great and the pants are super longsOtherwise the style and quality was as expected.thank god for the strapsThese are cute nice and soft and the design is cute.I bought another set of mittens in njunction with this one for a much cheaper price Safety st) and actually liked those much better.Very cute and lightweightThe bag that mes with it is good quality.Shirt is stretchy, mfy, and fitted.looks okay, its very low quality but dose keep your head warm during the ld weather.Was absolutely beautiful otherwiseThe dress quality seems alright and it is mfortable, but I am dissatisfied with the custom made sizing" and now do not have time to have it redone and sent again from China.I didn't realize when I bought this bag, the number of pot leaf tongue rings I was purchasing.I can't lie though, there are a few cute rings amists the marajuana memorabiliaI love my waist trainer for the zip up option but the hooks aren't very sturdy.The two additional hooks at the top are good and the fact that it is still firm when it zips works just fine.Pretty and nicely lined, but little white frays me off easily.a little thinner than expected, but as long as the undergarments are appropriate it's finePretty decent jacket, great for visibility and blocks wind quite well.It's soft, but wrinkles easily.On a positive note the two tops we bought fit wonderfully and on a uple of washes are holding their shape and lor.The tops are very soft and mfortable and while I still find the sleeves a little short on tops it isn't so important to me because they can just be pushed up.The subject matter is very ol.They are ok quality, not great but not wal mart.To big no use for it,Comfortable to be used for house wear.These are not the most mfortable pair of underwear, especially given there price.They are much more mfortable and a little cheaper prices.It's a cute necklace though.It's a great shaped shirt and the fabric hung nicely hiding unsightly lumps and bumps.A little stretch in the fabric and a beautiful, vibrant lor.This belt is ok for the price, but definitely not the best quality.Top is only good as a shelf bra.Cute earring.Still worth the price and I will use them again.The charms are lightweight.Material not as thick as I thought... good thing I went a size up...Would have likes it more if the materials were a bit heavier.Not very happy with this piece.The gloves are very mfortable, but they are not as warm as I thought they would be from the information put forth in the description of the gloves.I use them during snow blowing, I live in the Oregon Cascades where we get a lot of snow that has to be moved.Within an hour my fingers are just as ld as with other gloves that st less than half The quality and lors were as expected based on my previous Vera Bradley purchases.For the price, didn't expect the greatest quality but definitely seems like some alignment of the pattern is off.I LOOKED WONDERFUL IN THIS ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE SNAPS KEPT COMING APART SO I HAD TO USE A SAFETY PIN, WHICH WASN'T A GOOD IDEA BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.We bought a send pair in green to send to daycare for sprinkler play.It's not as structured as a true celine bag, but it still stands on its own.If you're looking for a fake celine bag and refuse to pay over like I do, this bag is a great alternative.It's a bit pricy for its quality.If you can replace the s***ty clasp and chain that nnects it when you buy it since those break, bend, and snap super easily then its definitely worth the price.they feel great on my legs and do help keep you warm I use it on my work bag that I don't care what it looks like.The quality is very nice looking, it feels very sturdy, it was just too big.Pretty mfortable and ol.Cheaper than anything I have personally bought from Forever .This swimsuit is very pretty and it is made out of good material.Too much for me to feel mfortable in it.I love these...unfortunately they easily tear at the big toe.This sweatshirt runs small, but is zy, warm, and soft.Flannel lined.It's beautiful and it recieves lots of mpliments.The straps that crisscross are not integral to the front panels.This would be fine if they didn't get all curled or hang loose.Not too happy about that but I like the boots so i will have the heel fixed.Mesh was very mfortable but no support for lateral movrment.Very loose even more than I wanted) but it is a bathing suit ver up for me, so it is okay.If that is what you are looking for, it is mfortable and attractive.In wearing, the crochet doesn't lay nicely I suppose if you wanted to iron it it might?Fabric is good though.This lace style isn't like an elastic band around your waist or between your legs, it's usually soft stretchy, but stays up perfect.I always buy large bc every brand is different I never want to experience the trauma of inner thigh restriction like little kid elastic band underwearThe design however was excellent aside from one blemish in which one of the gold buttons was not glued properly.The top is not very stretchy.Took forever to get that was pretty much the only drawback but, good product for the price.Otherwise they are real nice sports bras.had sharp edges I had to file down just to be able to wear it.Did not last long before getting rusty looking, but was beautiful while I had it, wore it nearly daily during the summer and really sparkled.For the price it was as expected.The jacket is mfortable and I expect to get some use out of it for the rainy spring season.The quality is fine like a firm felt, just doesn't fit very well.Beautiful lors and good quality tton.I loved the pattern on this suit and was hesitant ordering one offline.Overall I am satisfied especially with the price of the suitThe suit is made very well and I like that the hunter tied.not great quality, but it served it's purpose.I wouldn't feel mfortable going to the beach in this.These are beautiful plugs, but as another reviewer stated, the flares are very large and would be impossible to get in without a blowout if you're a solid g.Dainty design.Pretty roomy, but the quality is good.I was looking for arch support insoles that didn't try to do too much in other areas-- I didn't want a lot of heel cushioning or pads on the ball of the foot.These are pretty mfortable.They're great, until you wash them.Yeah, I'll keep it; it was ...but it feels like a golf umbrella on my head.I had to put it in water and reshape it by putting towels inside.It's still not perfect.Comfortable at first.The problem is the material is like a windbreakerOtherwise, nice shirt for the price.These are actually a very good quality shirt but not for wearing under a dress shirt.Materials was good.I will just have to plan on hanging it to dry.This dress is very nice the lor is exactly what I was expecting and the embroidery is quite good.I was hoping the material would be a little bit nicer, thicker, stronger... something.And for my very sensitive skin, it's just not pleasant to wear.The watch is great my husband loved it but we had to return it because there was a piece on the watch that wasn't made right too short it is where you latch it through the different holes.They are mfortable though.for you can't do much better, cheap breakable and they scratch and scuff easily so you have to take good care of them.They look good and fit well which is important, I would get them if you don't wear them often or near sunglasses for driving as that is what I use them forto make this work, i have to put it on then put a regular bra over top of it.I have to pull it down a few times a night, but it does make low cut shirts and dresses look good.but high quality.The hood is very roomy and mfortable.I often find that hoods are thin and not very useful, but not here.Alright, but scratches easily.Great low priceIt's pretty sturdy, since I uld put it on and take it off without ripping anything.However, I like the design so will keep it for occasions when I don't need warmth.Everything was perfect but I wore it with A white bra and underwear.Not practical for every day.otherwise it appeared mfy and well made.I think it would have been helpful it had rubber trim on the inside to stick to my body.The price was right, but the thickness is something I am not too sure on.The blood is usable but I have definitely used more realistic and better quality products.If this is for child Halloween st gym it will do just fine but any more advanced sci-fi make up you should nsider paying more money for something of higher-qualitySuper cute.... super see through (.The bodice part was a little too clingy for my work environment.It would be better entirely velvet with elastic on the back.I would opt to splurge a bit more on a pair that wicks away sweat better, and is more breathable.This is a great pair for weight lifting and doing minimal body movement.I love this bagVery pretty and dainty looking.right where the canvas lining is.I washed it in warm with like lors and dried on high.It will definitely need to be ironed before I can wear it.Unfortunately it won't do for work, but will be fine for casual wear.Overall the product was fineThe cut of this tank is really not that great nor very flattering.Earring is thicker than I hoped.Nice quality, but uld be an inch or two longer so it will stay tucked inOther than that, this is one cute pair of earrings that I am proud to wear.Will buy a better quality one next time.I have many of these shirts but this is the first time I have bought one and the sleeves are inches longer than all the other shirts I have bought.The picture shows a more quality product but that's not what is received.But eventually it did stretch and soften to a point where it was mfortable.From the pictures I thought the center detail was open lace but its actually iridescent overlay.Where the cups peak and the straps attach felt narrow to me, but overall fit for C was spot on, cups are very sturdy.The product description was spot on.Not appropriate for the all-white wedding I planned to wear it to.It's beautiful and a really soft silky fabric.Nice and soft fabric, modest verage with sufficient stretch and a moderate rise.They get the job done and are a good price for the quality.They are pretty and feel very nice but they wrinkle so much that I can't use them.Great gor the price Not super sturdy, not real silver But nice overallI got lace and diamond check both in size .Both are pretty good fabric and structure for the price and the patterns are more vibrant and quality than I expected.The lace fits perfectly but the diamond check is longer and baggier.So all in all the wristband was pretty,but as far as quality I do not think I would remmend it.I got this ring to wear alone and it's a very pretty ring but it's prongs catch on everything, I thought it was more of a channel setting from the picture but it's not.I love this shirt and my hubby did too if only he uld wear it outside of the house.The belt appears well-made and looks stylish.Cute by only for a newbornFits nice, but the material is so thin you can see through the shirt.The quality of the fabric is nice though.NICE, JUST STRECHES OUT, BUT STILL NICELooks great and quality is good thoughThe cups are molded, as well, so all in all there is great support in the bust of the suit.You can tell its stretched in all the wrong places and it is not flattering.The outfit was ok, but the quality of the material was not what I expected or hoped.The send necklace was fine.It's decent for the price.The shirt fits great though and feels awesome; wasn't too loose or too tight.They were durable and mfortable.The product quality is acceptable.It's a fairly nice looking and warm at.The quality of this product was as I would have expected it to be.Fits great the material is somewhat washed out not a vibrant black a bit dul.The material is also very soft.I love it but my booty cheeks hang out.Totally not made for this Asian booty but gosh, so darn cute.It is made of a silky material think old grandma bathing suit).Not a quarter of an inch to spare, and this material does NOT breath.. As the medium fits- there is no room to wear a shirt under this top..Plus for the price you want to maintain the quality and wear and these for sure skim and touch the ground causing the front to scuff.While the socks seems to be good quality, I found them not enough stretchable.mfortable around the houseVery soft and nice but too small after washing.Product and materials nice.The material is clingy and the overall shape not too flattering for me.I find it is very mfy though.We were able to fix it with needle nose pliers, but quality is what you pay for.The fabric quality was good, although it wasn't cut in line with the plaid pattern, which gave it a slightly off-kilter appearance.This is a beautiful watchThis would be cute, except for that the straps are so short they dig into my shoulders and are not adjustable, so I need to modify them.It fit as expected and I liked the style, but had to return it due to the fabric being scratchy and rough.Looks like a homemade craft.Its a cute top.It has many flaws not sure it was worth the buy.And it is really made by leather.It just ages me when I wear it, unfortunately.AwefulThe top is classy looking but not best quality but expected for price paid.The head piece looks good, but it is extremely hot.Otherwise is good.They are perfect for stume use, but not for everyday wear.Quality isn't the best, but I didn't expect it to be high quality for that price.Glitter will definitely be all over the place, about / size too big so we have to wait for her to be able to wear them.When the shirts arrived they were just fine.The shirts are a little tight in back, but serviceable.In general these are pretty good for the price point.Pro's Stylish, I really like the polarization at the price point.These are nice looking and working shoes for awhile.I love Tesla running shoes, but sadly these are not of the same quality and durability as those are.The material is very unlike the real ivory Ella shirtsThe wallet is soft and good quality however it is not the lor in the picture.I normally love these jammies.Not the quality I was hoping for.Other than that they are made well Also the skirt rides up because the fabric is smooth/slick.Nice necklaceIt's a bit short in the waist, and a little more staticy than expected, but it's still nice.Comfy and a good lor.perfect for lounging around the house.the material is a good value for the price.I don't mind though because it is beautiful.So good glasses but the age range I feel is higher then it should be.The material is ok.love the style, but the first day the clear gems came out.Gown is made well and the fabrichas a nice feel.It's really then material as well.It would be good if it didn't have to ntain anything, but it does.Quality isn't that great either.Nice quality but way too longThe fabric is not very thick.Perfect as a beach ver-up or a weekend top with jeans or shorts.It was inexpensive so I didn't expect high quality, which it wasn't.I love the style, when I wear it all my friends want to know where I bought it and I receive a lot of mplimentsThe quality of the material is a bit on the thin side for a sweat shirt, however, the lors are as bright as the picture.fabric doesn't look as fabulous in real life.Might look better wearing it with high boots better for taller girls.)Great quality and design.These earrings are very pretty.The silverwork and garnet is very lovely but the moonstone, notsomuch.Liked oroductBeautiful dress, but the straps were not nearly long enough to give my armpits some room to themselves.The material seems to be on the higher end and its well made.Super cute, but it has holes all over the seems from sitting down.The fabric is on the thinner side but that can easily be remedied with a slip or camisole.It doesn't wrinkle easily which is a lovely surprise.I just did not feel they were mfortable.But the fabric is mfortable.I have a straight figure, not much in curves.As I mentioned above, I have children, all birthed by me, so I have earned my stripes on my stomach and that excess pooch from pregnancy, something I prefer vering up.With the crisscross of the material and the molded cups inside it did fit well in the chest area.I had bagginess in the crotch area, not attractive at all.Very thin material, great design, runs very smallOtherwise, I love itBut I think it will work for a baby shower gift, just had to add a few more things to the gift.So that was far from ideal.Quality is fair.I love the high neck on this swimsuit and the sewn in soft cups...both were perfect for me because I needed the support and modesty for chasing kids at the pool.The Signature Power Mesh tummy-ntrol lining was nice; however, the leg holes are small and cut into the crease where my leg and hip meet...definitely not the most mfortable feeling.Not quite the quality I have gotten before.It is to wide to roll down the airplane aisle.There is lots of cleavage showing.Suit material was good quality.It's a beautiful and pretty believable ring with clear, well faceted, and radiant stones.I noticed right away that the center stone was gone and, amazingly, found it at the bottom of the olerI brought it home and tried to place it back in it's setting with some of my jewelry tools but I don't know how long it will stay.The pants are a lot looser than I like so I will probably not be wearing them to workout in but lounge in.Quality is actually really nice, bright blue that doesn't bleed, but of urse it does me no good if it doesn't fit.Not the type of material I was expecting.Well made, just not for my body shape.gave it a star because I think maybe a small would look better and the material is good quality and it was mfortable.Pretty but not well made a little clunky.I gave an extra star because the material is mfy, soft, and stretchy.Baby was still able to slide them off in her sleep even with the Velcro closure.I have others that are fine so must have been a rare flaw.But it did me quicker than expected and appears to be of decent quality.The lifesaver is very rigid.Since I ordered this for home dr, the stains and wear/tear are not too objectionable...Love the pendant.That stainless steel and lor is great.nice fabric, well priced.I have taken the top and cups I bought to an alterations person, and I am hoping she will be able to fix it to my satisfaction.The skirt is definitely big, but it is very adjustable, so no problems there.The shorts are a nice addition so you can decide how exposed you want to be.It would be pretty otherwise.Might keep for a time wear on my honeymoon then toss it.Love the glasses, but do not use the bagI think this rset is good quality.Very sturdy.Also the laces are more shoe lace style and not rope style as the picture shows.Overall good quality though.Great value but as a thermal goes is extremely thin material.Quality is what you would expect for the price.Good fabric, but it doesn't fit as expected.It would be great for travel or work, or just when you have a lot to carry.The exterior and interior are perfect Dooney quality.I was really just looking for more of a classic tote.It's totally cute, but beads are plastic.Nice quality and fit.Good looking and very good material, but the buckle release button it's hard to open it to release the belt.But other then that it's a good product.material is nice throughThe material seems fine and I really like the lor.Very sturdy...gives better support to your foot.It is cute I'll give it that.It's tton and pretty soft.Its lor fade after the first wash, and I use baby detergent with gentle circle.Love it..I was soo worried about fitting but it came out soo good..Dont expect too high about cloth quality but its good..It's a cute piece but I didn't like the closure.Again, the material and the lor are nice, it was delivered on time and in good ndition.after re-ordering this specific Mother of the Bride' Hat, it was perfectI thought this dress was beautiful.The sequins look tacky and are only glued on, if you have strong curves.It seemed like a great product, otherwise.Beautiful piece but not what I expected.There were random strains of thread but for the price, it was a great outfit.It's low st and gets the job done/ very mfortable and love to water it.Easy to use.Hoping to get it altered at a reasonable price.It's good quality.Sexy for inside play, not for outside wear.you have to bend the earings to make them stayFinally, I ended up with a beautiful and well fitting dress, but it was a lot of work to make it that way.If you're not good at alterations, think twice about ordering this dressIt's such a beautiful ver, it's a shame that I uldn't wear it.I like the material.Expected these to look nicer, but were not as great as I wanted.top was to small, skirt so cute I had to find another topLooks better in the photo.Is not a choker.A longer necklaceYes, I did this to a different necklace not to long ago.I wish the engraving would have been a little deeper to show off the beautiful design.I haven't yet worn it in rain.Great quality headpiece was bigOther than that, they're very cute sandals.Belt looks okay, but made from a type of rubbery vinyl.The buckle is nice and came with a protective film.Did not know you needed special tool to wear them.They are okay for the price, not what I was expecting.Was not happy with quality of this top.The quality of the materials is the reason this product got only / stars from me.Construction is overall is good.I have to keep my hand nstantly on top of the hat if I don't want it blowing off in the wind.It's a beautiful dress and flattering, but you have to have a lot of time to find your right size.They are super cheap, and can go in the dryer, but the waist isn't very mfortable.The fabric is moisture-wicking but really thick for hot yoga.Cute and my Acer chrome book fits well.The quality of the bag was great and the leather looked genuine.Workmanship was as expected .Eye padding is helpful Cons: .More expensive than it should be, but then again, it is Star Wars" merchandise .The ring is nicely made.I like the way this robe envelops you, over the neck, down to the ankles, and with a lush over spaciousness around the chest and waist.It absorbs water well: you can throw it on after the shower and yet it's ample enough to drink up water so that you don't feel you're in a wet rug.It washed well the first time, and shrinkage seemed to be minimal; there was a lot of lint, but that's probably normal, and I haven't yet noticed the loose threads that other reviewers have noted.A note on st: At , this was just outside my budget, and I bought it only reluctantly; at best, it is worth this price.I pulled them off and it worked fine for first mmunion.its ok but expensiveNeed to be glued better.LOVE IT, my son said it looks like pink and chome I was happy with the true size, details and sturdiness The top did not give the support I needed.But it is cute with a tank underneath.Flattering shape.I mean May/June weather is warm but nothing mpared to the upming months.If you are looking for an exact replica of Chris Pratts vest, this is not it.the power steps may last longer, but they don't work any better.I'm on my feel a LOT and walk a LOTOverall good quality.Not much bra support.Otherwise a nice light layering item.Quality productVery mfortable and cute, just wasn't what I was looking forThe quality isn't the greatest and seems like it should only be priced at about - and not the full .Shirt is really cute and seems well made but I ordered a SIZE and they sent a T.Be careful not to trim too much.The insert should have a line for each size so you can trim accurately and does not The material is as expected for the price you are paying.I wish there was an affordable felt-box style that wasn't going to st me / the price of my actual bag.My daughter loves it anyway and STRETCHES it to get into it.Great packaging..But I I don't like how it smells-strongAbout " longer would of been perfect and it would of made a great tunic.The pros are that the style is cute and a lil unusual, kind of modern and the material while a bit thin is super soft and mfy.It appears to be well made for the inexpensive price point and I've decided to keep for around the house and maybe I'll figure out a way to wear it I haven't thought of yet.It feels great, but the ld seems to stick to it.It didn't warm my legs like I expected.Great quality shoe and lor.Other than that, great product.Ideally, I purchased it for myself but it wasn't a need for it...Love the idea and style but some of the stones were not there and they are hard to keep upright.Definitely cute and worth the price though.It seems to be a decent quality underwear.Other than that, the craftsmanship is good.They are more mfortable for my son because it doesn't cut into his waist.The style is great, but thin, and the quality wasn't so great either.They love and cannot wait to wear when it gets oler.The top section would be better if a zipper or elastic for better form fittingThe white is VERY see through so be prepared.Good quality a bit large but wearableI don't really understand why the circle beads arts centered.Material is nice but it wasn't what i was looking for.They are warm and soft.Overall, it is reasonable quality for the price.LOVE THE COLORS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE THOUUGHIts a solidly made charm.Other than that, it got here quickly and packaging was good.The lor tones are very vibrant, too vibrant for my taste.Simply a very casual piece perhaps best suited for teen and post-teens.Material very nice and soft.It is good quality, but if you have any amount of chest you will be showing more than picture.Also, if you have a rounder behind it exposes more as well.The bag arrived as expected and is great quality.Hat quality is what I expected from Flexfit.Made nice for the price Don't get them wet if you want them to last.Or maybe polish it with clear polish.Soft and warm socks but they don't have enough elastic in them or something and they don't stay up.Quality?- ice only had it for a week.I find them to thick for my shoes.Material is good.These socks are nice because they are light.I have several similar tops that I use to run in without the pockets and they wick away sweat so much better.Combine that with the lined and droopy back pockets are awkward and make my back sweat with minimal physical effort and I'll stick with my other cycling tops.I did not care for the llar otherwise a very nice sweater.The fabric is mfy, but it runs small.This is a nicely made product.smells like fish (This item is VER Y light weight and that makes it difficult to keep the watch with band on top of the light source.works good for a swimsuit ver-up but wouldn't wear it away from the water.It's a nice bracelet, but the hair ties don't stay on it very well.I only need it to last for one use and the rest seems to hold together.It is nice and soft and has a very practical design.This item should be made thinner and the material of better quality.So much potential.Sometimes thinner material sometimes thicher recently shirts came with white ck logo on bottom which was nice tough but I expect nsistencyThe tiara is beautiful but very heavy.Overall quality is OK.So travel cubes isn't what you're really gettingGood but not as much as the pictureIt also is shorter than expected; it stops above the hip and the material of the jacket is eh.I bought a green fabric and replaced the bust with a customized design, and it is still extremely pretty, but it would have been nice if I didn't have to go through this much trouble.It's not as sturdy as the picture appears.The appearance is nice, not stunning while the band looks solid and durable, but lack weight and sound like braze aluminum scraps grassing one another while handling it.Overall the turbillion wheel accented in gold does the gold tachometer bezel around the Quartz very well.The exposed inner-clock-working mechanism is beautiful, along with the exposed rear Quartz.In addition, it's very unmfortable and not really good quality...It wasn't as well made as similar ones I have ordered in the past.Its not screen accurate though.The actual belt is pretty thick and well made.Perfect for a humid southern summer.I bought these with the intent that they would mpliment Ocean Blue Earth World Globe Charm".the fabric has some stretch to it but not much so if you have larger breasts the top fits tighter and more sports bra-ish than lounge-mfortable.The adhesive is just ok.The shirt fabric is thin, and I bought it larger than I needed, the medium fits like a large.Nice fabric and very well made though.Great product but don't see why it's so expensive.I loved it but it ripped first time wearing it -(Cute but it didn't glow.. After week outside in the Texas sonI bought it to wear inside the house when it gets chilly but it's not warm at all.Touch portions are not great.It stayed intact and did it's job, but was wearing out under my heavy use.Nice chain but links are made out of plastic and snap easy but very nice to the eyeConstruction not as durable as one would hope.Holdup Suspenders are for some reason much higher quality then this product.Quality was better than expected, but make sure you check the measurements.This fabric wrinkles very easily, as well.the material is also thicker than expected which is nice since the back is so low I don't have to worry about wearing a bra with it.but it was still beautifulVery pretty top.I love the idea of this product, but you can tell it is inexpensive.I wish the leather was a bit thicker.Its a beautiful purseAside from that it's beautiful.If you don't mind the lor, the price makes this a great little pin.It is well made, and the lor does look baked in as described.It's nice and shiny, and the pin on the back is durable.The quality of the poncho itself is nice.The outfit was exactly like the picture.Fabric is just ok.Quick shipping but the fabric is yellowing in some areas.The fabric is nice and soft tton.The stitching isn't the best.I like it, but the lace is to delicate, the buttons are not good quality.The top was not well made.otherwise great feelGood quality though.It's super cute though and good qualityThe dress is very nice and made of nice material.That being said, the material is nice and I love the lor.;) Besides that, perfect for the Summer.If you're looking for a royal blue necklace with a few rhinestone embedded accents, this works.They otherwise very nice looking shirts:)I love the suit from the front it's great but I have a huge gap in the back where it's not flush I have to get it altered.But the material is good quality.I expected it to look better.Material is good .. Would help if it was a little more stretchy Quality of material was goodI also noticed that they do not stay up for long and need to stretch a lot to get your finger through the hole in the gloves.I had my own expectations so I am disappointed but the gloves are very good as far as quality, but they would have been better for someone with different expectations.Beautifully made.Cute barbells, but first of all these are EXTERNALLY threaded which is not ideal for any piercing.If the seam was not there, the shirt would have hung beautifully.The pattern was beautiful as shown.My fault I didn't read the description very well.I love the fabric and the way it fits everywhere under the breast area.I have not had this issue with the necklace that has the screw-on ver, but it is not nearly as nvenient as the hinged latch ver that this necklace has.Pretty shoes for special occasions.My daughter wore these as a flower girl and they were lovely.Unfortunately many rhinestones fell off during the day and we were left with the sharp prongs that originally held them in place.There is a nice lining under the flowy outer dress.The fabric for these pajamas is wonderfully soft and a nice warm weight.I wanted these to work so badly because they are % tton and would be mfortable and breathable.Good idea and decently executed.The top is a bit weird though, kind of feels like my boobs are on a shelf lol... great support I guess.It's more of a night gown, than a sun dress.Comfy, but short in the crotch like others have said.Overall though the leather is very soft so stars for that.Great Value, Great Quality, need a NEW size chart/nversion chart.Its shiny and not very opaque.Luckily the breast area isn't see through because of the built in bra, but you can see through every other part.It is a beautiful design it just does not fit me.Decent pairs of socks, but definitely have quality befitting their price.Great material and cute design just doesn't fit my needs.Not happy with the Made in China" workmanship.Gems sit too high for the ring I wanted to pair this with.the look is great.Very cute and very high quality but not as mfortable as I had hoped.The material is a ol stretchy fabric and the fit is niceI love the design of shirt but wish it was different material.I love these two necklaces.I washed mine with dishwater soap and that helped somewhat.It's cute but it's a lot darker than the picture shows and it is definitely not an " chain.There's not a hair anywhere, and a faint fragrance is the only hint of genuine leather.Made in China, it's an attractive bag of a nice size.Very cute bag...love the lor, texture and very roomy inside.The bottoms are perfect for me but I can't breathe in the topI love it because it's Star Wars but it's very thin.They worked great with my fins added no extra size to my feet like my booties do) and when walking on the beach or smooth rocks.Mine is narrow and I noticed this a lot which meant I was fidgeting with them more than I would have liked.Very beautiful flower headpiece.She is in th grade but we still made it work and look nicely on her hair...Love the pattern.Fine for lounging or wearing under a skirt.I love the tank top the material is soft and beautiful.Just be cautious if you have longer hairNice material though.I didn't mind the cut and, even though they were a bit long, they are very wearable in a casual or office ntext and mfortable.The quality wasn't quite as good as I was looking for.I believe it would do the job, but is more worried about looks than quality.It does look a little cheaply made but for the price this is amazing.The material is a thick nylon so can be hot if you are wearing in hot weather.It looks tattier than displayed.Now I love these earrings.These hoops are amazing for those adults looking for something small enough to fit in the send or third piercing on their ear.Each of my ears has three piercings.It hugs perfectly so I don't worry about it ripping off.I have very sensitive skin and these yellow gold hoops are perfect.No breakouts from these earrings.I would LOVE to give these earrings a higher review.I would suggest the jeweler of these wonderful earrings reinforce the posts a little better.It's nice and soft.Cute gathers under the bow.Lovely fabric.An artistic friend add sparkles for me and now I have a unique top.However, I like the quality.Love the lour but was expecting it to be a little more leg hugging at the end.had to send it back, didn't like the qualityFabric is beautiful and the pattern and lors are as they appear on the photo.The materials are inexpensive, which is why I say it's a good gift for a young girl.Nice thin t-shirt material but designed for people about feet tall.Nothing needs improvement.It is soft and the lors are lovely though so I do like it.They are nice sunglasses but i wish it would've stayed together.As I needed them for that day only I just used them.I understand they can be washed and worn.However, these heather ones are a different material and a different fit.The material is also not the same as the solid lor leggings.The rest take unique shape stays and I'm better off with the plastic ones that me with the shirts.It doesn't look very much like the picture but it's still really cute and mfy.Very thick sweater material so it's good for winter.Nice belt, but doesn't stretch very much at all.Ring ok looks good not sure about the ating.However, it is still a beautiful rosary.not a great material.They look good, but I received pair of the same partnered sock.But it is beautiful and stays inVery pretty, I placed it on my dinning table.As for the scent you have to stand over it to smell it.I easily sewed it up.The material is nice as well as the lor.When I'm done, they should be very mfortable and more stylish.Oh, they wash and dry really well.Comfy material but a little snugI like the pattern and it vered what needed to be vered.Purchased this outfit for my son to wear to a wedding.It was a little hard to put on since it doesn't have buttons all the way down, but luckily the pants part were buttons and made it easy for diaper changes.Other than that, the material is a good quality and it looks super cuteYou can definitely tit is not % tton.It's ok. Not the greatest quality but ok for the price.It would've been perfect if the cups were made bigger and the straps weren't removable.I remove it and it fit a lot better and more mfortable.Especially for something so inexpensive.Super cute nice fabric.Fits well and is mfy never mind the priceThis skirt is made from a lightweight spandex material.Nice itemI love the shirt design.It is still a cute, beachy top...So don't expect any moisture wicking or anything like that, but it has a nice feel to it and is mfy...until you sweat up a storm and it's sopping wet.Then it hangs a bit heavy on you, and you're not mfortable anymore.Dress is beautiful, came on time as promised.The shirt/quality is nice.The price was good, the packaging was good.I also got my nails done wine red with one white nail; which turned pink also from rubbing against the vest.But I had expected a flowy, relaxed nstruction, deep v, / sleeve skater mini dress...It is nice just have to reinforce it to make it lastComfortable when I wore it new, but I don't think it will stand up over time even though I washed on ld, and skipped the drier.The material seems a little cheap on this, not sure how long it will last for....I feel it is not designed for long term use.The fabric is nice quality and the price was great.Look is great.Its so warm a zyBut the fabric is like thin T-shirt material, fabric that is more suitable for a top rather than a dress.Might be okay as a night gown.They are very light and look goodBuild quality seems to be good too.Cotton not so great.But it's a good quality hat.The magnetic clip does not work well.I wound up giving it to a friend who is a little lighter than meTypical Havianas nothing special about this great for a gym shower sandal.Strings ming out already.The material's good for the price, it is a bit see through but it's bearable.Pleated skirts are in this year so I'm sure you'll find one that matches the shirt.Awesome set to use for stretching.Cute, but needs work.I love maxi dresses and stay in them in the summer but the cut of this dress with the criss cross front just swallowed me.Lovely but it brokeNice designThey help a lot with plantar fasciitis.Great quality justs runs very smallerGarment was well nstructed.Packed it with a laptop, socks, rolled t-shirt and hard-ver paper notebook for recent flights.Knocked a star off because there's no interior support.I inserted a basic plastic bottom from another gym bag to firm this one up.Love the fabric, very soft.Everything else is nice, its not like tton sweats but maybe polyester tton.The button snap doesn't work so great.I like the design just as pictured, and it's well madeI haven't worn them yet because it hasn't quite been ld enough yet, but I know I'll have to wear them with leggings in hopes that it'll stay downthis is a great dress except the pockets really ruin the lines and don't stay put.great fabricThe glass was very clear.Always hoping it looks like the picture but I'm not surprised with the quality at that price I paid,I have another Allegra K dress that I love, so I'll still buy their clothing in the future, this one just wasn't a good fit.However, there is PLENTY of room everywhere else.They're very soft and warm and they washed well.Although the shipping was very fast, the bars were not as durable as I expected.The rudraksha seeds themselves are nice but rather big for the wrist.Besides that they're a wonderful lour and seem well made.Very cute topthis was not the same design I received the dress I got had alot of differences to the one in the pic was not happy about thatIt's pretty good if you don't have flab anywhere.Looks good not extremly mfortable.The bottom arm piece is definitly roomy and to prevent slipping off and for mfort we tapped bubble wrap around his arm.I like more how it looks on the hanger than how it does on me, however I received many mpliments the first time I wore it to work.I lose or leave behind a uple pair of sunglasses per year so will certainly keep these and use them until they too disappear into the sunglass abyss.It was not easy to use.HUGE is how big this one runs....but love how soft mfortable it isBut otherwise this is in a fine ndition, and a somewhat great product, and I am happy with this item.Not made very strong.It is a good quality and fabric used, but the size chart is not rrect.Did not like the quality.Had several strings hanging off and some sequins were loose.Not too much and looked great in the pageant.They are mfy for sleep, but don't unt on them for any substantial support.Bag still usable, upsetting that it isn't better quality.I got these and they look really nice.You know how a nose ring clips on?They are not very soft and while not itchy, are not nearly as mfortable as I had hoped.Went with a uple jar rings and it looked betterLooks better in picture, Challenge to adjust.The heel is quite mfortable SweetI would have given it - stars but I don't love the zipper at the top.I love the side verage and the back is great for tank tops.The design was blurry, but my husband loved the message, so it was still a win.But it definitely was cheaper quality printing.Not very nice quality, too long.The bottoms were great, but they are a bit revealing.Material was breathable but definitely not % tton.Not durable to withstand multiple uses.The outer lace skirt is gorgeous, so I'll just adapt it to my size.The Wonder women custom was great.Well made and the fabric was nice.But the wonder women custom was great and the price was great.It's really cute but more of a top than a dressIf you use only once in a while totally worth it otherwise maybe not durable enough for everyday use.Product is nice though.I wear a belt every day and have never broken a belt or buckle.This is alright, rather thin but great for spring.These are great at keeping your ears warm.It wasn't earth shattering, but it will doThe rubber on the inside of the strap to keep your cards in place is ming off.Overall it's an improvement from the bulky trifold i used to have but the shoddy materials keep it from being high quality' or the last wallet I'll buy.A better quality the quality was very cheapIt fit great everywhere else, lors, material and quality were awesome but I'm ' " and I had all this extra material in the torsoThis garment has no stitching anywhere.Cute item.The material was okay and so was the dress.It worked but the heart opened often so not after long my fiance dropped it without even knowingThe shirt is great quality, however.Good quality leather, fits wellfor the price it's doable, the quality is just okay.Nice desing BUT THE material is regularWearable, but unusual fit and feel.The sweater is so cuteThis is fine for the price.Its not as pretty as in the picture and is not a ring you want to wear to wash your hands.Do you really need the clutter?It's thick and warm and seems to be well made, although I haven't had it long so I don't know how well it will hold up over time.It rides on top of my ears, but doesn't ver them.The adjustable drawstring is just that; a string that runs around the inside.The material is nice, it is well made, just not made to fit on your head.Love this product, but it's not made for tall people.Good price, so I'll wear it around the house.The criss-cross straps aren't adjustable at all and ride up really high on my back.It looked great on him and I was pleasantly surprised when he wanted to wear it out on special occasions.Unfortunately, after a approximately the third wear, it has broken.It's a good sun shadeThe panties that arrived did not match the picture at all.Love the design, but it was too heavy to be held in my hair by just a clip.Better nstruction than most of this 's Go Go style.Beautiful dress but i don't like the way the neck mes out.Still a great splay pieceLatch didn't work well.it's beautiful.Stretchy but not as much as I would like.Waist was fine, but they're definitely ultra low riseLooks really nice as long as you wear with nude underware since the fabric is very light.Didn't like the material but nice cutI want to love this purse but the quality of the craftsmanship is what I feared - average of a cheap knockoff at best.I'll be looking for a replacement with higher quality lining/craftsmanship.I love the camel lor and it is genuine leather although a lower quality leather).Overall, I'm very pleased for the price, the functionality, and the looks of the clutchI prefer the super elastic belly material over these.If you don't like the super elastic polyester material these are for you.Was looking for something modest for outdoor watersports ie kayaking).More like a silky tank with shelf bra.This suit's material is attractive, stretchy and seems good quality.The opening on the bottom worked well to put on fin and then ver it and stayed on well while swimming.I would think something handmade would have better quality.Material Perfect Price Good Color GoodThe paper airplane is cute.Cute but too loose.Also not good for actually protecting your eyes from the sunlight.Cute as a topVery please with the fit and quality of the product.Somewhat short as well, when you sit down you may have some issues.My husband had to sand them to make them mfortable.Fabric is nice but only for size -.I washed and dried it as directed and the design started ming off after the first wash.These shoes were over the top as far as derations but thats perfect for a little girl right?The material and pattern are very nice.I uldn't even zip the top had breast implants).Very cute but very sheer.Oh well it is really cute and it's mfortable.I can see it back myself, but the stitching quality on both sides of the dress is not very strong.Love the pattern and materialBut it looked really good aside from that.I like the style but I don't like the fabric.It's like a shiny spandex.Pretty and sparkly but a bit big....it's too much for everyday wear but would be nice for a special occasion.Its really nice, just a bit short for my likingThey not do very well with vinyl.The shoes are beautiful.If you buy them make sure you find out a way to give them extra supportThe material is a little bit like a nightgown, but with the right jewelry and hair styled, it will dress it up.Once I got the mb to stay in my hair by lots of teasing, the ends of the tiara stuck straight out.Good for mild winters.Soft and mfortable, but far too small.MATERIAL: It feels like a silky t-shirt.QUALITY: Stitching is good and fabric is doubled.The stitching isn't the best quality-I'm sure these are nice capped mittens, but they're not work gloves, and that's what I needed.A little too sheer to wear without flesh lored bras, but so gorgeous.The movement in the layers is perfect.Carving, etc.Not sure whats up with this fabric?The fabric is nothing special cheap quality but I like that the top has elastic instead of snaps to facilitate nursing.This is beautiful but not very useful.Great price on this tooI mainly purchased these socks for the grip bottoms and for that, they are great.Nice chain, looks real.The chain is like a choker on my neckThe dress was made well, however it's not like the picture.It's a cute dress and very affordable.Necklace pendant is nice but the leather chain feel apart.It's not great without a scarf.The material is nice and mfortable, somewhat stretchy.Even if you have a larger chest there is no elastic.It is a bit short, but will still look good with my skirtThis shoe is as mfortable as others that I purchased that were similar.Feel great, sturdy nstruction, hand wash is remmended, these don't go up as high on the leg as depicted so you will only be able to wear these with full length pants or high booties/boots.Material and workmanship is good.Slightly more transparent in certain lighting than I had hoped, but bathing suit or proper undergarment makes it acceptable.Very mfortable, that's why I ordered a send oneA perfect at home dress.not so mfortable to wear all day.It is beautiful but the mounting point to hang the moon from the chain is a little off the balance point to make it even with the little tree piece.Vibrant lors and excellent material even on a hot day.The silk is soft and very nice fit, but it's silk.Decent quality, but after a few weeks I started to notice it degrading a little, glue is peeling from the sides, but other than that it feels and looks professional.They are definitely soft and warm, though.Soft mfy but run big.No belt loops eitherHowever, if you plan to wear this on a date or something, that's fine.Pretty good material that will probably last if it fit me rightFabric was not what I expected.Love the prints, just wish they were made of a stronger fabric that doesn't stretch out and move around when I work out.I was really excited about this product to me in and once it was here, it does not look as great as on the photos(not necessarily a bad thing, but its just my personal feeling).Super sheer and mfyCute but not as impressive as the picture.The material has good quality, but is not so stretchy.Loved the shoes but one piece to strap them on was missing overall I would give it a star.Overall, the price is great but still not enough to keep it.quality of graphics not as good as i'd have likedWill work overall.I love the lor of this top, but it fit just a bit too tight for my taste and was MUCH shorter than I thought it would be.It's well made and very pretty, but not the fit I was hoping for.Not the best fabric however the visual effect is quite nice.It looked nice, but after a few weeks it fell apart.Other than that, great shirt.Nice mfy jogging pants.wish it was more form fittingOne of them won't clip in but, so I can't wear them but they are beautiful.The one that does clip in, stays on fine not problems whatsoever ming off.If you don't mind having wool gloves, they really are very attractive and warmer than the typical fashion glove.they're okay, not the best quality but I love that they fit my month old daughter wellThe quality of the dressLuckily, I know how to sew, so i'll be taking it in a bit to give it a nicer shape.For the price, it's pretty good.If you don't have a budget for the noble llection, this one is a good alternative.Not exactly what I was looking for.I appreciated those straps thats pulls my buns.The top panels don't me down far enough and end well before the bra line.The neckline rides too high, but the dress is loose.It's decent for the price, but certainly not a quality piece.Simple knit dress.But the unevenness is within acceptable limits for my taste, and I'm willing to wear a cami under it, so it works out.Really cute top, but it is a crop top not a full singlet.Very pretty sparkles a lot but I do not think can pass as real but it's very pretty just need to put on better chain one moor attractive.I love the look of these.. but the sequins are not mfortable and there is no layer between you and the sequins.Nice lines and I love the pockets.Had them only about a week and got a scratch already.They showed up on time, price is reasonable, and they're white,(can I say white on Amazon?)It definitely was cute, but I was hoping for at least more than one seed in it.I do like the material and style though.These are not true Genie Bras but are mfortable enough for the price.Also no pockets, which makes it not suitable for casual wearing and running.You can just put in on and chill at home or do some light exercise in it as it get warm really quick.Looks much better in picturesIt was ok quality for a stume.Fiber quality not the best either.I love the print and once I get it on it is very mfortable material.I can stretch without reveling anything.It does not absorb anything.Overall, the dress is beautiful.I would not say it has the usual Columbia quality to it.love the look but the ear piece is not mpletely flush with your ears.very light and cute.But there weren't enough backs for all the earrings.This seems like it would be a good product for people with the right body type.The webbing is not as stout as I would have hoped.And the D-rings are a little too big, which allows for some rotation of the d-rings as you cinch down on the belt.It's really a matter of taste though and the price is goodHigher quality than I expected, but it's too big.If that's what you are looking for, this is a great purchase.This is a great glasses case.The lors are exceptional and vibrant and the case it tough as nails.The material was better then expected.If the dress had been nstructed better, it would be a beautiful dress.The quartz does not look very natural, it has a plastic look and opalescent sheen to it.They are pretty, so I ntinue to use them.The material is soft and mfortable.Over all its nice and mfortable.Beautiful set of jewellery.The product is good but these are not for right sided shirts.This product didn't work for me.Their support was very much appreciated.Good quality, but not made for anyone with thighsHe likes Star Wars, always wants to know what time it is, and loves the feel of rubbery items so this seemed perfect.Product looks durable and seems value for money.It's cute but your body must be in perfect shape the bra part don't hold DD and the side open part is very revealingIts hot and non-breathable material to be wearing on a hot sunny beachfast shipping good packaging.The print is adorable, and the dress was very sturdy and well made, with a lining included, which was awesome.Beautiful shirt but not as long as it shows in the picture.When it arrived the pieces of the necklace with separated from the necklace, I had to glue several pieces back on the necklace, now it looks good.I'm hoping a wash will shrink it up a little... Or when I actually have my baby in the next weeks, my boobs will fill them out better then.I still give it points because the stones are really sparkling in the right evening light and there is minimal prong action.The belt is attractive and arrived in a cute gift box.Shirt is great, but the tread on skirt was ming up when I got it but good for the priceBased on the thinness of the material, I will not re-order.So if that is your preference, this is a good shirt.The material is nice feeling, and lightweight; but snags easy because that is what this type of cloth does.Not as long or sheer as the photo.Cute but not of very good quality.mfortable, but be careful as these will shrink a lot.Pretty but the lace part curls upIt might end up being perfect.I've had other malas not made of elastic, the elastic on this one does make it easier to wrap and wear it as a bracelet.This is just a stume jewelry.perfect for teenage daughterIt made me look very bloated, so I like the dress much better without it.The make and design though is so beautiful.Overall, it felt well everywhere else.Chain is pretty cheap and broke but is still a great buy.Fruit is sturdy as a tank, though.These are great for the price.Cute in the picture; however, not very well made.The pattern doesn't meet up at the seams, but the fabric and stitching has quality.Looks cheap, but ok enough to wear grocery shopping, not for a night on the town with a pair of cute heels.What ever, it is a cute bag.It will hold loose change and such without difficulty.more pliable would help to adjust the tubing.I think they uld use a bit more stretch in the material.But not too modest.It's a beautiful print and material but it's shaped funny.I'm not sure how to make this better... maybe less bulk, maybe more stable?I have one on my desk and plan to buy another for the night stand.This dress is so cuteThe backs are hard to get on and off the posts; perhaps with time they might work easier.Great quality but the size is the proble.This is a cute set but not exactly my taste when I received it.Comfortable right out of the box, We'll see after a hour shift standing in them.Quality deteriorates over time which is a challenging scenario in the online purchases.Quality did not meet my expectationLooks good oknot the nicest finishI've only worn it once.I received this bag and thought it was great until I went to use the main mpartment zipper.Quality seemed ok, but then, I did't use it to try out the wheels/handles, etcOne was perfect but the other one won't openPajama itself is greatMaterial so so.Pretty but did not see the brass ated gold material.a little loose and see-through but the design is prettyVery pretty watch, elegant.It looked like it would have otherwise work well.This shirt is no where as long as it's presented in the picture.It is cute though and seems to be quality fabric.The lace back is cute, just really wish it would have been longer.It's not as shiny as the picture looks.It looks amazing on my gf though.Good necklace for Dr. Who loversAs it was the dead of winter I knew I wanted something long enough to ver my pasty white legs, but flowey and summery enough to stay ol.The dress was a little baggier than I would have liked and the neck chain in the halter turned my neck green.I got these in burgundy yesterday and was really excited to wear them today.I do love the thickness or lack of thickness) and having everything in one place, but I hadn't seen anyone mention this in the reviews.The sweater is well made and very, very soft which is why I bought several.As in jewelry you actually wear with a stume or themed outfit or for a performance etc where there's no close ntact and designed to be a little flashy but not extraordinary.I didn't like the material it isn't very stretchy Very stiff not as mfortable as I'm used to.I was hoping it would be a little loose so she uld wear it longer but oh well what can I do.I loved the fit but didn't care for the material.I didn't keep it because I just didn't like the material.It has a very nice material/quality though.Comfortable to wear and they don't show through my leggings.I felt it vered my backside well.If you are mfortable with that go for it..I wanted to use this after my pregnancy to hold my stomach in and straighten my back for breastfeeding.Might be good for people who want a more shapely waist under clothes or better posture.The sewing on it is pretty nice between the lace and the shirt.Still a good product only mplaint is the sizing.It's a great outfit for the price.They are cute on and mfortable on the skin.Somewhat baggy overall good product.I was very careful when pulling up and down and making sure pad was over incision rrectly.Not as pictures fabric not feathersMaterial is a bit thicker than I expected and thicker than the non-striped ties I bought from the same vendor.The fabric is nice, and it's not as see thru as most of these chiffon" type shirts.The description says it's a loose top... well not quiteThis isn't the style/design for me.I prefer the tie-dyed versions through other sellers.The material is different as well, not the stretchy T-shirt style that I also prefer but a more still and less flowing version.The zipper was not very smooth.Material not as good as Samfe which I got last time, not as thick.Shirt quality was good.UPDATED // I've had the shoes for months now and the point is about bent over and a decent amount of wear and tear.This is a lightweight fashion piece.It kinks up easily and it is long.Collects fuzzies from the scarf I wore with it.This made a great gift but didn't last long.With some adjustment it will be a great watch.I am not one to spend lots of money on purses so it's perfect for me.Easy to bend but my mom loves themFor the price, it's decent quality.Not so sure how true it is that it's real leather, but it feels nice either way.Other than that, so far I'm pretty happy with my purchase, although there uld be a few design changes.Price was greatThey weren't polished smoothly.But the pockets and space are wonderful.It's cute light weight shirt stretchy feelBut it just didn't work under my wedding dress as the hoops were too large.This would work well for a stume or a dress with a very large base, more than a mermaid or trumpet style dress, and where the fabric and layers were thick enough to obscure the metal hoop outlines.But the lace is pretty and the design is unique.These are super stylish sandals but they aren't made well.Not assorted, a exactly the same.Charm is very nice, but the chain broke the day I got it.My thighs really, really like each other and these bloomers were not enough to keep them apart.Beautiful but too small by the bust area.I bought it to keep it on the closets or fit some friend without breast.This looked to be perfect but isn't printed well.They go well with a white t shirt or blouse.And I love the pattern, very different.Great product just wished that I got a little more lift.I was searching days on every clothing site to fine the perfect at.I finally found it, what a beautiful at, it feels heavy in weight, feels like it will keep you warm but.... it runs small.It's worth the fabric, not finished on sides only the ends.Comfortable fit and works like any other pair of sunglasses.Great bag.I am giving it stars because the quality is good, but is is way bigger than it looks in the picture.Some of the loring is off.There isn't anything around the bottom of the top to help keep it in place not ride up.The zipper you have to be gentle with.Not the best printing I have seen on a sweat shirt.It looks a little like lingerie due to the satin material, but I uld not care less how others think of it as long as I love it, and I did.I would have given it a star rating, but I feel like the above would have really made a different feel in mfort and looks if it was tailored a bit.Quality is not that great, but you get what you pay for.Classy and casual looking dress.I feel like anyone taller than ' would have an issue with it riding up in the front.. maybe a sarong or something along those lines would help.The material was okay, for the price it was expected not to be that great.As a set this was too showy for me.The socks look great but material is not as expected when i put them on and they fit large.For bucks..I dunno, I might keep it and see how it fits in a few months, shed some pounds meanwhile, for the summer season.The only problem I had with it was the straps-- they pop off all the time.But it looks great.Not what I was expecting too loose.Material and style is nice.It's a good quality product.Smells mustyWhite PJ buttons on a pretty shirtThe shirt design is perfectAs long as I am careful with it, I can use it.you have to wear this just right our things pop out, our they ride up, really need a big set of balls for them to work properlyThis is a very sturdy top and I'm happy with the level of support it would provide if I kept it but it is slightly too large for me.Material and lour satisfactory.I love the style and quality though.Besides that it's lovely Received Item as described well packed.This belt was OK but not the quality of Merino in form or function.It works and looks ok, but will stick with the ratchet brand leaderOriginal buckle broke, inside piece, but liked the belt width for Jeans; so, bought a replacement.I think it is all right now, but I haven't worn it yet.I give it a because the first one is very mfortable.Whenever I wore these I received a lot of mments for their uniqueness.All in all the pants are a staple to my attire when working out, but I would've liked to see a better sturdier waist string and vinyl print for the lettering if I'm going to be advertising this product.Smells like plastic :I've been on the search for the perfect legging and was hoping these might be it, but they aren't.These leggings are not see through at all, which is great.Overall, these are a good price and will be fine for lounging around the house, but they are not what I was looking for.It is worth the less expensive price.With an , I can put my liners in and be more mfortable.They are mfortable for him though, and a good quality. of in quality.But they looked nice, wish I uld wear themI bought this without realizing it had a gold-finish.I am not a gold or fake-gold fan so I ended up donating this set to Goodwill.They really seem to help prevent him from rolling his ankles, which was the main reason we purchased this particular cleat.When I spend more than for a pair of shoes, I expect them to stay mpletely intact for more than weeksPerfect for a ol summer's day/ warm fall...Needed more support from the top.Dress is more peach then pick.I had to tighten dress to the point of being not able to breath to get my back to not show.Texture of material is really soft and feminine.Otherwise, the at is good quality and fits well.It looks good and everything, just it's strapless.....in the picture it's not.I love the earrings and I love Silver Forest.The hat is good quality, but made for a bigger head.material is cute fits as expected.The leather is really nice and pretty I got the blue purse).I loved this bag, It has plenty of pockets, and was intended to use as a work tote.I can easily fit, my surface pro, filofax planner, large smetic case, and files for work in this bag, but because of the extra weight its too heavy.The ring was not as shiny as the picture, but still a good deal for the price.It was okay that the closure straps were magnetic as this made it nvenient to get in an out of.It was put together very well and looks beautiful.Very light weight material.It worked well for my wedding after it was jazzed up a bit.It's less modern looking than I expected but lightweight like I needed If you like looking like you sleep in your shirt this is perfect.Good replica.It smells like dirt or earthy.Material is sturdy and will last for more than one use so that is a plus.Bottom fits fine, it's the top that needs more fabric.The quality was fine and hoop easily removable, but length is way too short for my dress.Pattern is very beautiful, quality in general.the hardware looks decent.The tton was really soft and the print lasted as well through washes gentle cycle) however, the type of tton made me feel warmer than normal t-shirts when wearing it.These are nice, but they are not substantial at all.My husband loves them for me to wear around the house for just him though.So oodly stretchy that I can only use It as a PJ shirt.Don't get me wrong, cleavage when going out is fine, but not when I'm working days a week in a bankThey are fine in the front and are mfortable the back is a little tight on me but I still like them.The quality seems good though and the red lor is nice.Will be curious about their durability.This worked to wear once, I wore it for a wedding while nursing my month old.Blanket-like.These are too big for my nose and for my daughters..This is a nice shade of lavender, and armhole placement/size good.Although quality not exciting, the low price is great.Nice rd though.Cute dress and loved it at first but after a few washings it's starting to fade in lor.However, I do like the material and I think it was sewn nicely.The product quality is excellent, it would however fit a child, not even a size- adult and I ordered an XL.Very sparkly and full of sequins.As the other review said, there is no seaming.If I had saw this in a boutique or art show I would not have bought it; however, if it had been brighter I would have.Typically this would be great because dresses are usually too short I'm ' but I would've needed to get it hemmed quite a bit just so I uld walk without tripping on myself.If you need to use a neck form frequently, keep looking for something better.It's one leather strap threaded through a loop.We kept the dress and had it altered because we loved it so much.It is for a July outdoor wedding and it seemed to have be oler than other long black dressesFelt pretty masculine to me.Warm and mfy though.left side leather is darker than the right side.For the money I thought it would be made better than it is.The pin brought on the same day I received it.They do hang weird so it'd be nice if the back had a design as well.I bought for my husband although the size was fine, the fabric is not one of the good ones.mfortableBesides skinniness" is not about style, just saving money on material.Looks good right now...still in the package actually... Let you know after I open/wear it...It is overpriced for the quality of material but they all are so there were no surprises here.I love the looks of this belt but it isn't as high quality as I like.Yes it did made a really cute Easter basket.While these are SOFT, I was looking for mpression underwear.These AREN'T mpression.I expected a bit more of a grip on the bottom, they still help on tile floors though.The quality was fine and the package came on time.Having said that.... the style and quality are greatDefinitely not top drawer...starting to look like dollar store items instead of the pretty things I send people to Amazon for when I get mpliments.These shines fit great with one exception.It just wasn't as well made as I had hoped.It works, but in a strong wind it still turns inside out.Nice looking necklace.Luckily we found it and were able to glue it back into place much more securely.Good quality but it came too small.The mask was well made, although it has no back to it.I love the shirt, but the seams came out the first day I wore it.I guess you get what you pay for, but I expected a slightly sturdier quality fabric, and I don't foresee this band lasting all that well.Really I would say this jacket is stume quality.Overall all I'm neither happy nor sad about the purchase just indifferent.Other than the fact that my cape is one sided due to a missing button, which I can easily fix, this dress fit like I hoped it would.Pretty dress liked the pockets the material was not what I expected.otherwise good qualityNot as many little gold balls in one earring as the other.Looks great, thank you.Very cute shirt and nice materialEverything is stretchy.I nsider this stume to be disposable due to both its price and cheap nstruction.Love this product it does makes you swet a lot but by the month one side ripe n I had to say good by.i'm full figured, it wasn't long enough in the torso, dragging the chest down so I returned...otherwise seemed like a decent quality for priceThis dress is very very hip hugging and quite low- it is flattering but the material is so thin so I wasn't able to wear it without a slip underneath.It was no surprise because the price was cheap so I uldn't expect the product to be any different.I loved the braceletI had to super glue it to prevent it from mpletely snapping off.I wish the plastic was of higher-quality.The description says they are in a box and there is a picture of a box.I now have an expensive pair of earrings that I can't wear.Slightly stretchy, which is nice.Fitting wasn't nsistentThis is pretty see through, really only appropriate as a beach verupwith turquoise trim me clip between cups.And it is short, and she uldn't fill out the top well.Free from defects, strap looks sturdy, shoulder pad is nice.This dress looks way better in the picture than in real life.Quality is not a curated with the priceIt was nice quality but I didn't like the style on myself.It was inexpensive but I won't be buying moreLove the look and the sun verage but I've had it for about months and it's already broken at the top.The pendant's stone was out when I received it.It is nice soft material I do like it, but gave stars because it is a little bigIt's a different material than I was expecting.I was able to attach a longer chain in order to wear it.This robe is warm and great for the winter time.However, I do love this robe as it is so soft/warm.I'll just have the hole sewed up no problem as it looks easy to fix.For the price I wish this skirt were a bit higher quality.It's felt like in thickness of material, and not much attention was given to the cut.Cozy, but not flattering.The material feels good and soft, however I haven't washed it yet so I don't know how it holds up.This tank top is not % tton it's /.I have zero nfidence that the zippers will hold up to regular usage.The quality of the product is really nice, especially for the price that it is.Good for everyday wearIt's a cute shirt and the material is ok, it's a silky feeling shirt that is well made.It fit as expected but it hung a little funny on me, I'm thinking it will look better as a layering piece with a cute camisole under it.They do give you a sash thing which just ties around your waist to bring more shape to the shirt, so you can choose to use it or not which gives it some versatility.I like this top because it is long and made of breathable tton lycra.The quality was great and it arrived quickly.Cool shirt but very longI really loved these for about uses but ever since then these have been going downhill.Like other reviewers, the center sticks great, but the edges are no longer sticking.Going to have to look for a better, longer lasting solution but these worked great for the first few uses.I love how soft these pants areA lot of the threads are getting loose, but to be honest I would still order these again they are soooo mfy while still looking tailored"Instead of being a forgiving jersey type material it is a stiff tton and makes it a lot more structured than i was expecting which means not really forgiving in the bust area as it has no stretch.If it had been a softer fabric with a little bit of give it would have been perfectBut it is gorgeous, I can't give it that great of a rating because of the flaws to it.After steam cleaning it, and cutting off loose strings from the dress, it was beautiful thougj, and didn't even need a bra.Gave a nice natural lift to the girlsThe cape is mink fur interwoven to the net mesh below.The item is still a beautiful cape that should keep me warm over an evening gown in the winter time.Super mfyLove the inside they're so soft.And I bought them because they have the elastic at the ankle.Great shirt for the price.It is also very mfortable and soft.There's nothing at all wrong with the quality and was super cute, but the sizing issue needs to be addressed.They'll be good for layering in the winter, just not what I was expecting.I've had this for quite some time and it was really great until the steel boned parts began to me out.Not very good quality at all.My daughter is happy with it after I fixed the hole.Appeared to be well made.I love the ncept of this bra and the material is very nice and soft.For me those arm cell phone bands don't work.I recently found the top and looked at it again, and after being left in the air, the smell went away.Just be realistic.Material is thicker than most sleepwear.Not the best hat I've ever seen.The fabric is shiny and soft, i would remmend hand washing.Get Giro or Shimano they are better in quality.Great shirt design but it didn't meet my expectations at all (We love those rings in spite of the size issue but my man has to keep it on a necklace, not that great.It clips at the bottom, which I thought was kind of odd, but overall I absolutely love itI think it was stored in a damp musty place.They catch easily on a towel or shirtAffordable but great qualityso we bought T as well to give her more room.This is definitely not haute uture.It's very flowy so there's plenty of flexibility for kicks, splits and all other dance moves.Lovely dressBut unfortunately the pins" fall off, I've had a good of them fall off already.The fabric is thin and nice to the touch though.other than that it is good material and a very nice mfy dress.Not as long as the picture.it is a poly fiber and light weight.I thought is the material was too thin and required more special washing instructions than I wanted to give it.But kept them for laterWish it would have fit as I loved the rest of it.They weren't quite what I expected, but they are warm for the winter.Other than that, the fabric and flow and swirl of the skirt was really attractive,The quality was nice, though.I will need to lose some weight and find some smoothing undergarments to really make it work.If you are in good shape and wear smoothing undergarments would be fantastic.The design did not show up very well and it is really plain.I purchased it to wear as a thumb ring but didn't like it but there was not defects in the ring.It didn't rest on my head properly.I was very pleased with the adhesiveness however, this is not a good product for full C cup women.The cup vered just above my nipple I guess i should've gotten a D cup.Shoes did not fit well however there was excellent customer serviceNot exactly what I expected given the picture.Quality wise, it IS ming from china.Good dress for the priceI love the pouch design and fabric.It was a good buy, but didn't last even a week.This little tton gown is made very narrow, so wouldn't be too mfortable for sleeping.I will use for house work or little daytime household chores in the hot weather.It just does not look as good as the photo.Decent socks.I use this at home and it is very mfy and cute.If it were more mfortable material, I would have bought it in every lor.Material was silky and light....style was great...just a bit smaller than I would prefer, but still a keeperThe Silver Tone Baby Feet Dangle is made specifically for a pregnant woman's belly ring hole.At first, when I received it, I was thrilled to give it to my year-old-daughter who is about weeks pregnant.She was so happy to see the cute little feet.Very good product, I remmend this, but is betiful.They are underwearWhen I got it I had to stuff towels in it to regain shapeThis is quite dainty.not real mfortable, but that's not what these are made for....Short waisted, not much rear verage.Nice heavy fabric.Although, they did show up when they said they would and were of decent quality.quality is good but sizing is off a little.Did not look as great on as the model.They are good quality, but they run big.It is ok but definitely looks better in the picture.Material is good but too much string for a petit guy.I have ." hip measure and had to take about off the waist and " off the back strap to keep the strings in my pants.came in on time but some of the jewels weren't on the bows so i had to glue them on myselfThey look and feel good while standing).The person who makes these should smooth out the clay.Up close they show too many finger prints.It doesn't take much to smooth out clay.I WAS EXPECTING A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY FROM DRAKE.Not the material it was expected to be.For the price the quality uld be better.Not very high-quality and the gauge is way too long.Good novelty gift.Not impressed with size or quality.Quite unmfortable around the neck area where it ties) for prolonged wear I wore mine for almost hours but other than that, it fit as expected.Looks better pictured.Nice set but the necklace was of a cheaper quality than expected.The belt that came with it is some kind of faux leather that had a strong chemical smell to it, so I tossed it.This suit, though cute and well-nstructed, seems to have been designed with a pear shape in mind.(For reference, my measurements are --, bra size DD) Thankfully, the return was processed very quickly and I had my money back the day after I sent it off using their free return label.Really ol looking watch, but broke after a week of wearing it.It does have removable straps which is nice for tanning.Way too long, but very mfy.I didn't recall what I thought of the quality of material because it didn't fit.Production description did not match the item received.It is definitely not as flowy as in pictures.Giving it a on the quality for the pants.This affordable two piece dress looks really expensive.But that's ok with a few alterations it will look greatThese do seem to be better than the regular backs that me with most earrings, but not the security that I was looking for.Not great quality but equal to the price.The heart is barely heart shaped and crooked, but still cute and I will wear it.The lace is pretty.Although the workmanship wasn't great see photos).The sequins are quite bling-y, and I decided it was too gaudy for my wedding.Pretty, but doesn't feel sturdy.Nice gloves but a little itchy so I'm not sure how mfortable they'd be if worn for a longer period of time.The material is very thin, and the sleeves were very tight, though for the most part the fit was okay.The lor is wonderful, the material is soft...The designs are cute and will give you a laugh.don't know how they wash, but I don t think there will be a problem, the material feels ok. For the price Its worth it.It's a great shirt for under a cardigan but not so much for going out in.I like that it's soft and I do wear it under other things.I love the design and fabric.The leather is soft which is nice and I like multiple pockets but because its so floppy it's hard to reach into any of them.Other than that, it would have been perfect.Very elegant.However, after a uple of weeks I wore it, one of the structure bone steel came out.This dress is adorableIt is made well, with nice materials, just runs small to the size. stars just for soft feel material.looks good over all and is what i wanted.It looks like it would withstand a few wears.i cut the bow tags off and still love the thick headband for the winter.Stones are shiny.I'm dissapointed because it isn't made from natural leather.Although its great at protecting my child's ear from infections because its gold plated and sterling silver which was my top priority I wanted the earrings to last.As a mother its hard taking on and off earrings daily for bath time, having a earring that would not tarnish and last for at least months would of be worth it.Overall the product is okay I do love the screw back on for safety.If you have the time to take the earrings off for bathing it will last longer and be worth your money.Very mfortable, stretchy and a good length, not too short.It mes down to my shins, also I thought it was a tton dress, but it has a stretchy polyester feel to it.Otherwise, good productwas not flowy as picture suggestsgood material though.These purses are beautiful.Polyester type material and the lors are beautiful but too small for me.I am tempted to give them a just because they are came in delightfully packaged.can't figure out how to wear it.Otherwise, adorable pajamas and very mfortable for my year old.Other than that, the quality is fine.Hopefully it still fits this Winter.shirt and design are great/as expected but shirt is definitely not XL.But otherwise nice for the priceIf the grip was a bit stronger then these would be five starsThis is a well made shirt but there was just too much material for me.As a dress it was great, so if that's what you're getting it for you may like it.Nice fabric, decent nstruction, nice level of detail and style.Just be aware that this thing is vered in glitter and it will get everywhere when you open it and will get on your clothes, in the car if you wear it on your way to the race or event).Workmanship on the shirt is not the best in the world, but will do.It does not look as elegant as the picture, it appears to be ribbon stringed through some stones.It would be better if there were elastic cuffs to keep the wind out but otherwise a good at..This shirt is more like a night shirt as it is super mfy, but it was so long.Looks like the pictures but definitely not made of t-shirt material.The product was made quite well, except the bra cups inside were placed rather high- closer to my llar bone than where they would need to be.Nice but really ran small, I wear a woman ordered this item in sz x it fit perfect no wiggle roomI'm giving it stars because the quality is ok for the price, even though the little elastic threads started showing after one wear.I will definitely need a support bra when I wear this.Otherwise perfectThe glitter looks neat on it.The lors were real pretty, especially with the sparkles on the outer layer.Not sure these are the original Lokai beads..I have one from the Lokai mpany and there's definitely a difference--but for the price it's a good knockoff.The material felt amazing.It was good quality however it was not the right size.I handwash it.It's a OK qualityI bought a size months for a month old thinking he uld wear it this summer.The dress is mfortable and the quality is ok.It is good that the pad inserts are removable as they seem to run small.I found it mfortable and non-binding, but would not purchase again because of the band.Something very lightweight.The material was zy but it pulled very easily.Pour qualityWhile I love the material of the bottom half saying the bra/cup area is the top there's a few things I didn't find amazing.Pretty sure the string problem can be fixed with proper sewing.It's nice material but isn't as flattering as I hoped.These gloves are not as warm as I had hoped.Fun good shirt, great for the anti social, material is soft and mfortableI wish it vered my forehead more but it certainly keeps me nice and warm on the shipping dockThis one is more mfortable.Cute and fit my daughter well but not really impressed with the quality.The fabric isn't very soft.I bought them a size up in hopes that she uld wear them next Christmas too but I'm not sure now.Beautiful and soft lace.Nice printing and fit.:-( The other shirts are great.The Mermaid image is not as clear as I hoped it would be.The product came quickly.If there is any give in the fabric, the garment should be a nice weight for summer.excellent productI wish the outside skorts were a little bit heavier fabric.very pretty, fabric is soft but fits small.A little scratchy....not soft like I had expected.But, it is warm and mfortable.The gold trim is a little shiner than I would have liked but it's very nice for the price.Used a white crayon on the zipper to make it easier to move.* The fabric is not breathable and not the most flexible spandex.Feels like polyester/rayon.Frog closures and satin trim are nice.Washes easily; did not put in the dryer.Comfortable to use.keep it because it was good quality. has sticky edge but overall ok for the price.Despite that flaw, the shirt is very soft and was mfortable.The cut is very blunt though, between the shorter front and longer back.Might look good with a skirt underneath with leggings.there are a uple of areas that are not perfect sewn.Beautiful, light weight shirt.The description on amazon says its about % tton and % lyocell which i prefer).The lyocell mix will reduce the shrinkage and reduce wrinkling.I am very happy with the shirt otherwise and love the mfortable fit.For the price it's fine.but I'll make them work.It gets a crease in it if you sit or wear it for more then about hours.Its great for right after you have a baby but I only wore it for about days.The bodice is perfect.Cute pattern, arrived as promised, however, nsidering the price there should be an option of regular or tall for men and women.It looks good, fabric is a bit shiny.Too expensive,wrinkles at first hour of wearing.I washed them and they were fine.Material is scratchy and crunchy.Lots of fun but the wires are a mess inside the sweater.Scratchy material but good for athletic mpression applications.If you want a soft feel order Saxx Fiesta or pro Elite underwear because they are very soft inside.If you are not sensitive to that, then they are warm and mfortable.Material is good for warm weathers.The shirt looks longer on here.The necklace is as shown in the picture however the picture portrays the necklace to be better quality then it is in real life.I say go for a better quality product even though this price is a good price.They are not stretchy spandex like I expected.It definitely doesn't look as elegant as the picture shows.Aside from that, made very well.Quality not the best, but was expected for the price.The fabric on the inside is very soft and mfortable.If it laid flat it would be great but as it is I really can't use it.I've trusted Woolrich for durability and lasting quality...Coon Rain Coat, CLOVE not so impressed.It is lightweight for spring summer use.Cheery plaid liner.Nice pockets.Love the socks and patterns.Wish they were a bit longer... After washing I gave them to my wifeThe design of this bathing suit is beautiful.Nice frame for the price.Modern look.The nstruction is adequate.The shoe held up for about - months.This is a nice item- but cheaper made than it looked but I guess matched the price.I was looking for a lightweight set of tights for lounging/sleeping during the summer and maybe outdoor wear under clothes in the winter.They seem to be well-nstructed and of good quality and are very mfortable.The bottoms fit great, I have no worries/issues with the bikini bottoms.. however the top was the major issue.It's well made inside/out and exactly how I pictured.Not bad, elastic is a little unmfortable after a day of wear but it is breathable and very soft.Would have preferred bigger crystal and less chain.It's fine, expensive for just heavy card stock and a clip.I wasn't happy with the way it fit or the quality of the garmentComfortable, looks good with leggingsAnd the material is very nice and thick.It was GORGEOUS .. For the first minutes.I would love it if the material was not scratchy and unmfortable.There are a billion tee shirts on Amazon aloneThe fabric is nice tough.Love Vionic and the support they give in a sandalLove the shape and style of this but it's a little too short it's totally polyesterCould of been made better for hat price Great backpack but stitching gave way on one strap within weeks of purchase.It keeps me warm, not the best fit, but it will do.I love the texture but its a little too roomy for me.It was very sheer, thin material(expect for the price) and fit a little more loose that I had expected but I still like it.The quality is not the best and the price was not worth it.They are mfortable and they move with you and don't bunch up in the private area.It is really pretty and the lace is soft.I like the soft fabric against my skin.I don't wear it often but the design is ol so I kept it.Would have been better and maybe more vibrant on a tton shirt.fabric not good qualityIt feels secure and is not too bulky.However, the silin sleeve is too loose which drags on the hard shell case whenever you need to use the phone.It's not linen more like a heavy tton.AttractivePurchased dress while I was in my send trimester.Otherwise it looked ok quality.Great jumper, i love the design but the quality of the jumper is a little too light for my liking.Thought this gown would be heavier than it is and it's not well made.The material wasn't the same as I expectedThis tops fits fine, I just don't care for the material which is not so good for summer wear.This dress had the potential to be cute if I had wanted to take it in for major alterations.I'm not sure what type material it is.I thought maybe it just needed a good cleaning; but it looked exactly the same afterwards.They are very loose, and I would say easily made for an or above.It looks like a stume jewelry.for the price it did it's job for a few months, and sometimes that's all you need to get started.Thanks for the low price.Got for myself an my husband an the words on the bracelet its self faded so it just looks like a plain bracelet but good quality over all.The front pouch is a bit snug, and the waistband/drawstring gets all twisted up inside the fabric easily, but the fit and style is good enough for the price.The top does look lovely nonetheless.The legs should have more elasticity with some softness this would have made it excellent I originally bought these for better support wearing my casual shoes Clarks/superstars).It is a nice wallet, not expensive but very practical, however, it is not mint green.Really cute laying on the bedI am giving these three stars because they are so different from the original Cheeks of which I had four pairTook a bit of time but I think I got it to where I can wear it with out any problems.They are mfortable in the foot but will not stay up on my calf.This dresses is so pretty and I wish it would fit me I was so up set when it didn't I wanted to wear it to church this Sunday (.It also has significant breast pads, which make you look molded and in place, which can be good or bad for you.The pads don't provide support, just a nice appearance of support.I don't think this one will last long, and with the looseness of the top, i am a bit ncerned about getting wet.It's perfect and great looking, every kind of cards would be save using of this RFID Wallet.Quality fabric; very soft, slight strech, not sheer at all.Will have to take it back ( Again, great quality.Glass was nice, so overall ok.Cute but large, these TOMS are unique and have been mplimented often.Still a lovely top though.I love the lor but the material is a little stiff, even after washing a uple times with fabric softener.It's great to wear with leggings but I wish the pockets were lower.Not mfortable to put hands in.With a pencil skirt it is adorable.It will be good once its stretched outOther then that, it's a very good productSome are more mfortable than others.This pair are one of the least mfortable that I own.Aggressive arch support.It fits good but the back stings broke off and now I can't wear ittoo hot to wear for extended timenot as expected in materialNice curtain but the st for quality didn't measure up.Cheaper material than it looks in the picture but okay otherwise.It's cute, but it feels cheaper than I would like.Jersey type material but mfortable and fits just right.I burn easily and bought this scarf to keep the sun off my arms and chest.Not so good: this shawl gets quite warm if there is no wind or if your standing still.Definitely designed for very flat chested people.Skirt is very short made with very soft fabric; great for bedroom play but NOT for a Halloween or stume party--unless it's one of those" partiesI cut a small slice and used a brown ribbon Once you fix the issues this is the key piece to mplete a Han Solo look.I love the material silky and mfortable.The stume quality is not as good as expected.The fabric has a good tton-polyester feel and is quite stretchy and feels soft against the skin.It's an ok bathing suit but flawed.Its ok. Its not very stylish, but it keeps your head warm.The material is not the plush look or feel that I expected for the before" on sale price.I use it outside for extra vering on my legs(like a blanket) in the ld..It is mildly warming for to degree weather in my humble opinion.I needed this for a vacation in July but was not able to wear.Pretty but not awesome qualityThese are very cute slippers.I have bought these early for a gift for my great niece.looked perfect with my wedding dress.Weren't too expensive so I guess you get what you pay for.Love the tie clip but the bar won't stay on my llar.Its okay, simple, quality fair, can't mplain the price was good.Not the fine quality I desire.I love this ring.It rubbed off in about a month's time, Otherwise it is a nice ring.It's beautifulBut it's great for the thick girls This ring was so beautiful and I really loved it.First off, this is a top quality, very warm at, good for ld temps and snowy weather.A bit pricey for what it is but its very nice, only downside is it can pull woven ties.Less than two months old and the strap broke epic fail Otherwise good bagnot super supportive.Back is really cute, but not really functional.I love everything about it with the exception of the underlay.But the quality is nice.the material is not as good as I expected it to be?But it is very soft and will be a great pajama shirt.Fabric is good and graphic design is greatThe material is very mfy for my yr old.I always have a hair tie on my wrist, and it just ruins my bracelet game, so when I found out about these I was stoked.I bought this kind and the kind that has more of an indentation/groove cut" into the bracelet itself.Good QualityThe quality is fabulous, BUT it's much more green then in the photo.While I do think it would appeal to a gamer, there's just not enough surface area for mfort.Looks like it won't hold up to repeated washes HOWEVER the shirt quality is top notch.This dress was too clingy and didn't have enough of an A line to suit my needs.Very spacious.Also not my favorite fabric choice but all in all happy with it.Totally awesome picture, but the fabric is super floppy.Not good for travel, you'll need mpression support that also includes your feet otherwise your feet will swell up when you're flying.Otherwise a solid fit.But good quality though.Picture is decent but not really high resolution".Chain and overall pendant is sturdy.It shows a beautiful bow at the top and when you tie the straps, it just doesn't look like this.waiting to receive, pretty in picturevery thing fabric might be ok for summer.not in any way better than Carters, just more expensive.I do wish it was more form fitting.First I want to say the fabric is soft and lovely but the fit is somewhat tight on the white shirt exactly like the pink one I purchased and the pink fits perfectly.After a workout, they are stretched out and not so cute lol but they work.He wears it for extra warmth on those lder nights and mornings.they broke really fast but worked great and looked sexy as well.The Velcro area isn't very large so there isn't a lot of flexibility in size.My wife is loving this bathing outfit the product was well package looket great the fabrics are nice I am fully in acceptance with itI give stars because it uld help protect softer stones like rubies or emeralds.Useless to keep dirt out of my diamond engagement ring which was the reason I ordered in the first place.Not every mfortable I would assume.I bought this necklace to go with a dress i had ordered and it was beautiful.Don't know if it's real leather.The only reason I kept it is it can be a clutch without the need to transfer all my stuff and has lots of space.Fits great, but cheap material.The lor is stunning.Look great but be prepared, screws me out rather easy.The quality of the product, outside if the lor, is very high.These are an inexpensive option, just understand the reason for this, for the price I guess they are okay, I for one would rather pay another for a higher quality product.Looks nice, but pricey for the quality.It is mfortable to wear with the exception of the zipper.The zipper isn't the best quality therefore I am only giving this product a star because of the zipper for now.New garment is perfectthe chain is actually really nice; probably higher quality than the rest of the necklace.Strings everywhere.Functional, soft, warm but minimal fashion.But the finger loops.It's just for around the house when you need something not too tight or expensive.Not high quality and can gape at front because they shorted the material at the button holes.The material is soft and its cute, but no way its a x.Was expecting better quality for the priceTop is a nice material, but it is thin.The bottoms are a bit see thu-ish so I didn't get in the water, but as beach mbing I felt mfy in it.fabric quality is not good.I don't know this for certain but the feel of them make me think this.Expected same quality as found in StlandThe straps are adjustable and it looks great over bandeaus.For two pairs for the price a bit pricey don't stay on my / month baby's hands and the material of the printed area is not soft for baby w/ eczemaLooks better on d model Dress is a little cheaper lookingThey are mfortable but if you are wanting them to work out or last you a long time, save your money.Looks different.I love the way this fits and feels, its super mfy and looks how it is pictured.Taking time out of my day to sew something that should have came in tact /Skirt is nicely made but not as described.Not sure how warm this at will be being it is now summer.The loring of the patterns on the sleeves is ol.Definitely wish that these were more mfortable.Good material I love itI bought the gold tone weeks ago and loved it immediately.I guess I am mpararing this one with the gold tone; also antique in nature but very well done not brassy.Cool gift...the leather is soft, the snap is strong.Not what i expected but it is good quality and they came on timefine for the gym.Couldn't get the wax to adhere.After trying it on, I realized it wasn't my style, I don't like that the back over layer has a cut all the way up it.it wasn't bottle of blood it was some cheaper brand but it worked okI looks a lot bigger in the picture than it does in person but for the money it is quite niceThe sleeves were very unmfortable though, much too tight, for me it's not worth it to keep the dress with this issue.Seems like high quality though.I had to pin them to my bra straps to stay up under my shirt.Though, it is still a beautiful atBeautiful dress but the cut out for the arm too big which mpromises the overall fit.Looks great and feels substantial since it has some weight to it.I order a sliver and I receive a gold..It's very cute but I'm so upset because now I have to go fine a sliver because the gold doesn't go with my outfit and my iPhone s uldn't fit .I am not sure how sturdy it is.The inner material is plasticity but seems easy to clean.It isn't a bad bag besides that but bare in mind the zippers are not well done.The stones are set so high from the post.The sleeves are not relaxed.The quality is fair.Think fabricThese do not fit over glasses.Good length thoughGreat quality, but the balt tie isn't balt.For a wedding, so it just won't work.I love the wallet and the quality of the leather.I love how the bracelet looks although I am sad to say it came with one crack all the way through, I would remmend some sort of safety wrap so others don't have this happen as well.It's mfortable but zy like it looks in the picture.I do liked the tooled leather.Not a very stretchy material, in fact, no matter how much downy I put on this it won't be soft.The price is too high for the quality.They're mfortable.** While the pictured hat is certainly a decent product without holes just several loose strands it is not what I received.A pretty cut.But fabric is nice.The material feels good, and I anticipate these lasting me for a while on work sites.Looks nice, don't put too much in it, keep it for a special event.The straps don't hold up for daily use.I did not find the material attractive, so I returned it.My daughter loves this sweatshirt, thin but nice and lorfulOverall I'm pretty much satisfied with this bathing suite.However the top has no padding so therefore it gives you no support but it can easily be fixed by putting padding in the top.But in the end I'm still able to wear the bathing suite after I fixed the problems.They were inexpensive so that is a plus, especially for something that I was only going to have her wear maybe one time.The Backpack needs improvementI really appreciated the side-bags, which made it easy to acess day-to-day items.Perfectly serviceable, but not a favorite.Not as well made as I expected.The bracket was beautiful but don't look the same as it was on the picture.Regular maternity pants are much more mfortable and versatileIt has a real vintage looks to it it is impressiveIt was mfortable, and I felt like a supreme bad ass while shopping for groceries.However, one of the straps popped out of its home there are six thin straps so the bracelet didn't look too ol with a strap hanging apart from its strap family, nor did my supremeness last.I used jewelry glue to mend the strap to its home, and so far the glue has performed well, maybe even better than the bracelet.It is a beautiful watch but the picture on the band is fading.Adorable though and just as pictured.Too bulky for me, but wonderful customer serviceThe quality of nstruction is good for the price.These are mfortable but they are SO heavy.Pretty OK product for the price I paid.Easy to reattach the strap by hand but doesn't add to the quality feel of the product.I can still wear it to work out but I like the longer flow of it original before I washed/dried it.Top part fits great, material is mfortable.The price is fair for the quality.Other reviews are rrect, there is no beading on this dress only the sequins.Would have liked the fabric to be just a little thicker, but otherwise a good purchase.Very soft though, and if fitted babies properly, would be adorable and warmThe little ball at the end where you insert into the nose was sorta weird and a little painful at first, bt they worked well.This is a very casual jacket, but it is very soft and quite mfortable.The quality is below par.Lots of hanging thread and over sewing.It's not exactly high quality but I didn't expect a lot for the price. stars are for craftsmanship and the suede" PU being so much better than the high polished" plastic stuff.And of urse the low st.These were extremely affordable and gave me the options I was looking for.Well made and thick oz quality material.This shirt is definitely rugged and made for the outdoors.Styling does not stand out but those that know the Filson brand will regnize the subtle lines of this shirt.Nice chain, again too short and wants to fall off my neck.Pretty top but not for me.I bought it to wear with tanks for easy nursing a newborn.Good quality but not exact lor as picture and smell funny.Material was poor, jewel was cheap however the fit is ok.I like the feel of the material, it's thick and soft, but these were not the typical side snap onesies I had expected.This is no different than a regular onesie that needs to be pulled down or over.The material isn't what I expected, I should have read better.Silky mes to mind I hope it isn't to hot for the beach.HAs to have special handling for washing.i hope to have more deal with you with other item and more quality.Beautiful and nicely made, but is it real leather all around?This was very nice and quality was good but looked like something my grandmother would wear.Worked great but I only have worn it twice and it already has a hole in it.It's time seems to drift a little quickly, even for a cheaper watch, but my main criticism is that the crystal scratched super easy.Love the top, but it is a VERY clingy material.Not a flattering fit at all.The material is beautiful and the lors are bright.But they were delivered quickly and keep my fingers warmThe hat is adorable and well made, but is way to big for a newborn.The pocket has extra material that uld have been done cleaner.I found the grips was not as sturdy as expected and it pulls easily on rough surfacesI had some what of a time getting the dress but after getting it all I heard was how beautiful it is.You have to be careful very careful with it because some of the rhinestone were very loose and some fell off.It was advertised as a inch plush and it was only inches.The deration on the dangling portion is obviously a sticker with a glossy finish on it, and is actually not as detailed up close as one would like.Beautiful belt though, very well made.Very nice for the price, but mine came smelling really funky.The quality was average and although using care putting them on it easily ran.It was fine at first but then my mom washed it not knowing that it had to be handwashed because there was no tags on it.The wallet overall feels very cheap...I will be giving this away as a game prize, so it will work just fine for my purposes; however it is very over-priced.The fit was perfect and the sticky stuff lasted all night might I mention I wasn't sweating so who knows otherwise this uld have gotten stars IF it hadn't ripped after only one night of wearing it As such, I can't tell you how long the stickyness lasts nor if it stays strong through a night of dancing because I only got to use it once -they do include the glasses, nice touch, the material for the top piece is well, inexpensive, as the price is.this might be perfect.Pants are somewhat too wide Top is fine.The material is beautiful, but it was too large for me.Just my taste....It is thick fleece and very soft.Kept my nose and neck warm.Perfect for a childIt is a beautiful and flattering dressI'm giving these starts because they are good leggings, just not what I wanted them for.They are not wicking at all, so the sweat pools up.Not a hundred dollar belt so don't expect hundred dollar quality.Says made in the USA with imported materials.Its fine for the price.Other than that, it's a nice shirt for any occasion where a little baring of the mid section is in order.Word of caution it exposes a lot of cheek, but if you don't mind then go for it.Send this dress is probably not great for people with short torsos.The dress is not held by the belt, it is just a fashion accessory.It's a flowy dress, but with white undies, you will see every mark.SoftThis bag is really cute, and all the pockets are great.The fabric feels amazing, snug and soft, but there is just not enough room for me.Good chain, link strong.Nice design, but I didn't like the quality of the leather.Loved material and pattern.It's very mfortable.The rings are super cute, I can't wait to wear them.It arrived without flaws and is beautifulPerfect, they adjust automatically with the spring out hinges.Beautiful dress . the straps were a bit long and didn't really ver me very well . some double sided tape is needed and the dress is really short .They do a decent job reducing glare.Uniformish at a spa.Otherwise they are fairly soft and mfy.Not high quality but will do.The workmanship was great.Was not happy with the applique being on the breast.I think the metal of the little ring is too week for this application.The vail is beautiful but for sure not cathedral length like in the title.It is a " veil but it is made very wellOtherwise, the beads themselves are nice.Happy with the fit, as always full seat verage, rise stops about " shy of my belly button, the vered elastic is mfortable and stays in place).It's a beautiful jacket, otherwise.I love how soft it isExpected better quality.Good product, but nstantly leaving fizz" on my shirts.I work outdoors on Long Island, NY and need a face mask on the really chilly days.It appeared to be well-nstructed and of a good quality fleece.Love it but one of the rds came out of the clasp after a few months, so now I'm going to have to see if I can fix it without breaking it more.It's fixable, but a design flaw that didn't have different body shapes in mind.I had hesitations after reading reviews online about the quality of ROMWE's clothing.Just don't expect anything super high qualityit look a very long time to deliver and its not as loose as it is in the picture.with that said, its still very mfortable and cute.the fabric is very good quality.It is very cute and mfortable but after less than a week of wear the ating is already beginning to peel and metal underneath paint on the turtle is beginning to show.It was swimming on my month old and she is over the th percentile for height.One side didn't stick very well.Wish the glue would work well the next few times too.Not happy with the quality of the productQuality splay, just be sure to remember it's very small.The tag says it's Belle Pogue and apparently Belle Pogue doesn't care about quality.I'll have to stitch it to keep it in place.Wasn't expecting it to be so thin and almost see through..other than that,it is nice..It sells for cheap and worth it for the price.However the fabric and xolr of dress beautiful.Wish that the material hadn't been so see thru Fabric felt good but wrinkled.The leather is cheap though but for the price, it's niceGood quality, pretty.They work great for stumes but the fingers did start ming unsewn within a uple hours of wearing.Good in a pinch for the price.It is pretty for perhaps Spring but not the red I was wanting.But the at is nice my daughter said it is really warm.Nice overallVery nice but plastic is thin.I thought it would be softer.My biggest beef with this shirt is the silly shoulder thing they did, which does not look nice as in the photo here.Some more elastic would definitely help these spots, as I feel that these bits of the jacket should feel more snug than they do.It's a beautiful dress, super flowymfortable useBut I don't think it's worth using it to try and stay in regular pants throughout pregnancy the mfort level of actual maternity pants is just so much higher.Great quality and lor, just wish it came in a larger size.They are nice and soft though.As for the material and style it is great.Beautiful necklace, Shipping was very fast.Packaging was very thoughtful.Not very flattering but may look better on someone less curvaceous.They do the job, and they're good quality but it's not what I wanted.The purse feels like leather to.Love it just be careful with the shield, it easily scratchesIt's cute and my daughter loves it, but she will on be able to wear it for a few months.I love the rubbery feel of the material and the lor, but not sure what I'm going to use it for.too shinyThe lace is not as soft and gentle as I thought it would be.It's a nice blouse, other than the lace is Not as soft as I felt it should/would be the blouse is soft and fits well.It was super cute and well made.text print quality is not good, but its pretty mfortable to wear.it's just solid fabric in the backThese rings are very well made and I like the style.Quality is okay for price.I liked the lor but the material was too thin.Nice look, seems sturdy.Its really soft and the design is ol.It looks lovely but it's too small and the lightweight fabric would show every single extra pound and bulge.It's more of an oval.My sister didn't get the memo of Wonder woman" socks and bought them for me.I look amazingThe dress looks great and I love how they feel.Very pretty, and they work alright for their purpose so far.Though, do be careful with them and use lots of extra lubricant s if you're rough with them they WILL breakThese are nice and great detail for the price.Only because the supper was defective had to get a new one out in all really spent more than u should have for this outfit.Unfortunately it has a small rip in it and I'm devastated because I received it the evening before my trip out of the untry.ExcellentThese outfits were absolutely adorable.The gold fades away to a silver lor and you can see the glue where it's put together.Feels more like a Medium.Great quality material, screen printed design.Jewelry cleaner does not help.The graphics are good qualityGreat quality but they all fit slightly different.I love it but I don't like the materialVery nice and mfortableI bought this hoping it would be a really good doormat quality wise.Should have metal rings for neck strapShirt fits fine again similar to the picture but not the sameThe only mplaints I had was that the zipper got stuck zipping it up and I was scared that I was going to damage the zipper and I wouldn't be able to wear at the event.The other thing that was more important to me was the quality of the sheer material.Some of the rhinestones were gone when they arrived.Really nice quality at.Quality was good lor was good.Not very happy with this product the cane is a lovely cane arrived on time but without the time piece not sure what went wrong but I'm not too happy as this was a present for my dadI really, really like the watch a lot however the quality of the band is a little to be desired.After a few adjustments and limited time, I just cut them into stockings.Get too big after a uple of hours wear but the material feels so niceIt's a nice ver just turned out.It was great for the first few months of use.The plastic tunnels break so easily, but the tapers seem to be holding up well.Cute, I wish the soles were more substantial.These crocs are really zy It seems homemade not professionally made shirt.However the finish is nice and smooth and will use them as our wedding bands.The dress is nice just like it was described in the picture.basic but mfortableNot my favorite star wars necklace.Good as props for photos, but not for daily wear.The finish is not the usual soft, tton fleece.It has a slick" feeling to the finish.The design is fine and as pictured.Very cute, but will be interesting to see how the fabric performs over time and washings.The quality of fabric and craft are good.I like the fir of the Ease In To Comfort Fit" Capri better.I thought it was a wrap dress but it's sewn shut with an elastic waist that you then put the tie belt over, and it's too bunchy on me and hits too high on my waist to look good.It's also solidly made.Not pristine but totally fine.Worn it probably a dozen times and the gold is starting to me off.I finally threw it away a few months ago after it sat in my closet with hopes that I would get around to fixing it/gain some weight.Looks good.Still material used.Other than that, great quality and fast delivery.It is not as mfortable as I would like.Spend more dollars at motherhood and get better verageOtherwise it looks pretty well made.It doesn't look too fake and the quality is great for the price.Great for the price, but a little itchy when worn for longer than an hour workday.Simple light tton t-shirt weight nightgown.The quality is good, although they run small.Cute design and mfortable.nice fit nice lour the lettering has cracks in themThese are really pretty and the top fits fine; however, the bottoms are long enough for a basketball player.I feel like these rings always want to slide off my fingers.Dress advertised as high quality.For a jacket I like wiggle room so I never buy jackets perfectly fitted.Cute but not mfy.It is a deeper purple than the picture and I thought the material was tton, but the description states that is is a chiffon material.Earrings are pretty well made.It is very mfortable.Decent quality for the price paid.I got the tan studded one.Some of the stitching is a little sloppy, tho it seems fairly sturdy.nice for a cheap necklaceCute design.I'm " tall for reference.I'm giving stars because this is beautiful and so inexpensive mpared to others like it.Good shoe to wear around the house for the youngins.I should probably pay more attention to what I'm buying but the price was great.Otherwise a nice product and as described.The material is thick and clingy, and it rides up quite easily.The lors were nice though, and the shirts didn't shrink or fade in the wash. Maybe ordering up a size will help offset how clingy these shirts are.Comfortable Too big but fine with layers on.Cute knock off accessory.As far as keeping the sun out your face and off your neck, it's greatI'm in the towing business so this ring was the obvious choice.I thought it would stand up to rigorous activity.Surprisingly the rip has not spread, I still wear it, just a little looser.nice earrings.Good, basic pinneyIts Ok. Not very sturdy arch support.A lot better than anything your average shoe mes with.Cut big but very mfortablebut it was a great buy for the price and was fairly easy to adjust the veil by removing and reapplying with hot glueNot as polished, and not as clean sculpt/casting....It's not what i was expecting, but the fabric was high quality tton and the design was still really nice.The quality is decent but not outstanding the stitching is well done but the fabric is fairly thin and will definitely require a jacket in the fall and winter months.Overall I thought it was pretty ) although I am not a fan of the material or the way it looks in the end since it looks a little different from the picture.I love the lor of these underwear and my son thinks they are ol.The skirt is beautiful, the material seems to be of great quality, but, the lor on some of the stripes are faded.It's not good showing off your legs because your socks are too short.Material is urse not a soft blend.This is a very bohemian wrap.It's not sewn very well and it's definitely synthetic.Great travel bag for.Nice shoe, but the design is rather odd in that the tongue of the shoe won't stay in place.It's not easy to see on the pictures but it's a problem.Quality is fineThese leggings are a nice quality but they are not made for a thicker girl.So beautiful.Looks better on the website than it does in person.I uld get the same look at a cheaper price in TJ Maxx or some other clothing disunt storeComfortable I am so disappointed that I don't fit into them because they are so soft and I think they would be so mfortable.I wish the fabric had more...something.Decent cut, but diamond better whiteI bought this once the wire came loose the mpany was nice enough to replace it no hassles.This needs to be handled with way too much care; which I realized given the structure.While it's beautiful, a few of the beads" were already chipping after the first wearGreat look, but somewhat thinner material than I would like.The tie doesn't stay kept for long, my child easily mes out them.I love the texture and the authentic look but I don't like how the tongue easily mes out of the tie, which makes it hard for my baby to keep them on and walk.It's great for the price.I love how it did protect the glass through.I love this bracelet bought it for a Halloween stume but uldn't wait to wear it again.Love these but zipper will not stay zippedI expected an expandable brim.The look great.For the price, it's great.But don't like the shower curtain material.Not soft on the skinNice pattern, llar is somewhat askew, material is thin.If I lived on a island, I'd have no mplaints.Comfy but not for tall people.Not the quality I thought it would beIt's a cute bag but it's not super well made.did not like the qualityMy daughter thinks this is a tab bit short and the material is a bit shiny.Otherwise, a super cute skirt a fraction of the price of the real deal.Not that great of quality wore one time but then just tossed not good qualityStill smells after also airing it out since the day it arrived.I loved the feel very mfy.The design is nice and quality is what I paid for.Plus the item had an odor that was not pleasant.The price was greatIt works better on longer wavelengths, and as a nsequence, reflections off of things - off of water - off of asphalt - off of leaves appear to be blue.The material is quite thin and requires layering to be decent.I received this product today and it's really very cute and seems to be relatively sturdy nsidering the low price.If you have wide feet this my not work for you but seems to be good quality.It feels really nice and the fabric is decent.Feels like paraxhute material but soft.Very heavy but looks well made.Nicely wrapped.was ok not quite the quality I expected but worked well on my bald head during chemo in the winter months.I absolutely love them but the first time I put them on the crotch ripped.My now wife is a woman that loves presentation and thoughtfulness.She loved the ring box as well the ring.She loved how the LED light makes the ring gleam and glisten.This is better than the cheap original ring box the ring came with.It's a simple touch, it mpliments well.It wasn't too hot because I've bought from this seller before and it didn't me off that pair, and I heated the water to the same temperature.This ring is beautiful, and for that price you uldn't ask for anything better but over a little bit of time the little gems on the side start popping out which is unfortunate cause like I said the ring is beautiful.It is a high quality shirt but expect to wait a long time to get it.Cute glasses.Cute just wish it wasn't itchyI never used dryer, but I did use the washer on gentle.Smells like real leather.The leg warmers are nice and me neatly packaged.Workmanship is just okay.They are the most accurate to the pictures.The buckle is much lighter than anticipated.I no longer have this product it's really basic and I found out I needed and wanted more from my tracker.Fabric is a bit more casual looking then I expected, and a little on the thin side, but, with the proper undergarments it would be fine.The material is good for the price.The lors are beautiful and the cut is curvy so it's mfortable.Not very vibrant.nice glasses, but not at all like the picture.Kind of disappointed with that because I love mesh detail.Great for a beach ver up.It is far less impressive than expected (I am wondering if the bar is hypoallergic but what holds the gems in place isn't.Great for keeping the sun off your head.Would have been stars but hat is not that durable.I know it isn't that expensive, but I still expected a little longer life.First impressions can matter greatly when you're in sales.Way to small Fabric ok your average swim wear fabric I am a C and uld not zip up over my chest Love the pattern and style Just wished it would have fiti feel so delicate and fairy like in it but i can't wear it outside.- months is a REALLY wide range.Like the fabric.These socks fit me and the design is awesomeWhen cleaning my ears with alhol it strips the smooth ating and turns them white.The stones are gorgeous, and the lor ideal.It looks like the - field jacket with a few improvements that make it more functional, mainly it doesn't soak up water like a sponge and inner pockets.Very cute shoe.Not exactly what I expected, low quality material andIt felt hot against my skin.They were well made, however.I looked wonderful on the model.Metal so thin I was able to bend it back into shape with tweezers.so i cut the straps and made a regular bikini lol good quality of material.However, I am losing weight so they are fitting better.Not the best quality, but a great prop nonethelessThis is thin tton but it is good for the warm monthsNice qualityNot great stitching on the seamsMaterial is more like that of a table cloth, not a very flattering fitLooks cute and I like the material.I wouldn't wear it on its on because it makes you look bottom heavy... definitely would wear a long cardigan to minimize that.Beautiful earrings for the st, however the back peg broke off after only a month of use.Would have been stars if they fit.Great priceMaterial was substantial and lors were vivid.It also is a deeper plunge in the front than I am mfortable with wearing.It is a great shirt but thinner than expectedThis product would get a better review from me if the lor was represented better and the sizing was accurate.It would look good as a short dress if you dare, or with leggings to be more nservative.Not great quality and smaller fit than expected.Thin and not as well made as other Burts bees sleepers that I have purchasedThe quality is good though.The quality of the neclsce is not very good.While the rings were good quality, they were much too big for my nose.But the memory foam is very mfortableI loved this shirt when it came it was very nice fabric too.The material feels like a soft towel.Could of been made with better material but good enough.Overall good buy for the price )I need something that's going to be mfortable and suck my love handles inNice print but didn't like material was thicker than expected.It is more performance hoodie with a shinny finish % polyester not tton blend that is why it is getting stars not happy with the fabricBut, overall, I thought that this ring was adorable and fun to wear.Good value, silk is thin, jersey-type weave rather than satin, a little short in the body but not a lot.Was on time leather goodLooks exactly like pictures.Trim is not great.Don't think too highly of their quality.Lovely material, the dress is beautiful.not very strong material, but they are very stretchy, and pretty cute.The other portions were great.Liked the hat, just needed protection from the sun which it did) and needed the heat kept away.The material was not that nice.If you do, have excess belly skin this will not hide fat) and want mpression this product is perfect.But, the lor is very pretty and the material is nice and soft.This really would make a great maternity top.If my shape were more proportional, I think I would buy several more of these in bright lors.Not as good of quality as I had hoped but ok for the price.Great looking boot.Not a lot of support for mfort.When I wear it it always move around and doesn't stay in placeI had to give my daughter a wrapped picture of the item for Christmas, which I was not happy with.Nice and soft but doesn't stay on head I need to wear lighter hat under.A perfect nightgown.It is a baggy, thin tee shirt, longer in the back and mfy.It's so wide on me that I ordered an elastic waist belt to help cinch it in.priceyAs other reviewers noted the veil is not as long as it is in the picture.Absolutely beautifulItem is good quality, i can use it for the future, but just not for what i wanted.This is a cute Halloween tee.The fabric is a little thin but I can layer the shirt with another light weight tee.Functionality wise the light tint does its job and they feel mfortable.Must be altered but looks good, Heavier fabricVery cute and mfy.I got this dress but it was TOO Large, I love the style and material so I am saving it for when I get pregnant I uld wear it -)My son loved the design but uldn't find a good fit.She hasn't worn itOther than that, it appears to be good quality.These underwear are nice, but the package I received does not have the same prints as what is pictured above.Do not remmend, even for the price.The quality, however, is not that great as expected of the price I paid.It is sheer but I'm fine with that.Really cute and flattering silhouette.Light and mfortablethey are okay.. no stretch.They are more of a spring fashion glove as opposed to a warm winter glove.Well made vest, but is very trim in its cut.Too much money for the material of this top.The stone popped out even thou I uld fix it....other stones have also came out I'd say this is a perfect bracelet for a stume but not a life time piece.It's OK alittle expensive for what I got.Loved this bag, but the zippers aren't very sturdy,For the price, it's a decent smoother" but definitely not slimmingNothing is tearing, other than being too short for me, they are excellent.Not sure if it will ver that well if you are into wearing tighter tops/shirts. stars becuz I had to give the skirt away to my taller and skinnier sister as an early birthday gift.Got the shirt in white thinking it may be office appropriate.Mine had a honey brown/natural leather appearance as advertised.It is also reasonably mfortable for the price and with a good fit and finish.It's ok would have been nice if it came with the same amount of needles as piercingsGood for third trimester.Too much material before thatThese socks will look great if you don't look too closely.I love the lours and the material.Everything but that is great I just really can't wear them because they pinch off circulation on my thigh'sIt was soft, although I thought it might be fuzzier.The bust, waist and length are awesome, stretchy soft material I'm really happy with that portion.I did receive this for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.When I got them, they're the texture of tights.Maybe if I got some garters, they'd look alright on me.Just good for knee socks.The two stars that were not added was because of the material of fabric was usedIt's a very light weight and soft materialitchy, but cute.While they may be slightly oler, I have yet to get any blisters in the Belega's and I found them to be more mfortable in general.The shorts are adorable and I love them.Cute shoes, very light and easy to clean.One broke right away, but the other is still in good shape.The waist I ordered is a little large but some of the reviews suggested that the shorts shrunk a bit so after washing should be fine.This dress was very pretty and made from a nice, soft, flowy, material.Good quality but not true to size.I think these socks are great, but I received two pairs of the little cherub ones not my favorite) and did not receive a pair with Starry Night.Good socks, good price, but the packs may me messed up.It's very fitted and feels like Lycra.Otherwise, great product.not very good quality and good looking.But it's cute and zy.There is no flexibility in the fabricThe lace applique on this is beautiful, but the netted material it's sewn to is very scratchy, and I don't think it will last more than a few wears.It was purchased to be worn to a wedding, so we are keeping it, but we don't remmend if you're looking for something to last.I love the leather cap The reason why give it a three-star because it has too many folding creases on the Cap Not as soft as I'd like, The Arms Are A Bit To Short FOR ME To Use Comfortably with the thumb holes.Decent dress for the priceLitttle on the short side, but it would be a cute shirt.I am just not accustomed to it, but these are beautiful..Not the best made item I have ever ordered, but my husband likes it, for his ins and a uple bills in the little pocket.Not great quality fabric but satisfactory for the price.The necklace is gorgeous, however, not pleased with the way the earrings set on my ear.Fits good but quality is what you pay I guess.Luckily after wearing them for a bit I was able to stretch them a bit and are now wearable.I will have alterations done.These were a good quality but ran small.The fit was fine but the quality left something to be desired. stars for quality, but the fit is way off.The quality is great nice thick wool, the skirt is lined, and the style is very flattering, so if you can order it a uple of sizes up, I would remmend this skirt. stars for quality.looks great help up for months but began to fade.not exactly what I expected doesn't block glare in day time no better than regular sunglassesThe leather is high quality, but I don't believe the wallet to be a well-designed.I suppose this would look good on other people but not on me.I have three binders.The material is great, but the sizing is way off.There is no give in the fabric, so if it doesn't fit loosely, it's not mfortable.If the fabric was a different material, I would love itBut the neck is higher up which is fine, I uld dress it up or down this way and it looks alright.The mpass does not work at all.The only issue I have is I can tell the studs aren't sterling silver, I can tell because of the way it interacts with my piercing.It is more shiny.Third, the stitches look like a basting stitch, not a permanent stitch...I hope it holds.It may work for you and the price is good for what it is; just wasn't what I was looking for.Fits nice, but is like towel qualityOther tall women should just purchase knowing that alterations will need to be made.Good quality, but super snug with very little give.It was cute but was not flattering for my shape.very thin fabric not good quality.This just isn't good quality.Not a high quality item, but they can pass well enough.I can't stand feeling my earlobes being dragged down and I'm not sure I'll be able to wear them.Having said that it is mfortable and I love the high neckline.Love this dres...very pretty as seen online.Comfortable to work in.Great for working in the hot weatherAs I expected the shirts did a great job keeping me oler than tton t-shirts did.Really cute and super fun to wear.The finger holes don't work though.Cheaper alterative than Iheartraves but you must realize it will also be a cheaper made product.If going by quality alone I would have given it a for sure.It's still usable and cute, I just wish it would stay together a little better.I'm not sure how long they'll hold up either, since they're just plastic.The material was not as I expected.It seemed well made though.Seems like good quality but was loose in certain places for me.Looks sexy, but not mfortable to be on for more than a few mins.Very cute otherwiseThe straps outer stitching is what isn't very mfortable as the rest of the material is very stretchy.There are very very form fitting.I was expecting it to be just a little loose.If you are already perfectly fit and want a skin tight shirt and have the nfidence for that, than they would probably be great.Not the same pattern shown nor the same material.I have had it for months now and it looks practically the same as when I first got it.Nice style but I'm not a fan of the materialBut other than that it looks great on and supports just right before bed.The metal IS shiny and pinkish and the lored crystals ARE pretty.Very pretty, and simple, but I did have issue with a set breaking that had never been worn.Overall, the set worked out perfectly.Not a huge fan of the chain, but over-all the necklace is really cute.The chain has darkened over time.Everything was great about this stume--except the chest portion.Good shoe for the price.Would be better if it were priced around Would have gave it stars if not for chain.It is a silky shiny material that will be nice for the summer but I'm not sure how it will wash.The charm broke off, but still a beautywas ok but not quite the quality i expectedNice and soft fur.pretty but just didn't have the high end look I was I was seeking.Hey, I only wear stockings rarely, and I'm sure the stripes will be fun for some odd occasion, so I can set a low bar for mfort quality on these.It was a nice material and the model like very much, but I received an M size...I feel as though they are good for casual around the house use but I wouldn't wear them with a tight shirt outside the home as the support just isn't what I need.It's OK Quality It is VERY pink, with gold undertones, and would look great on someone with a ol skin tone.The material Carhartt has started using is rougher and stiff, probably more durable but the old kind was soft and more mfortable.I will dress them up with jewelry and hair accessories.Overall quality well, just more bummed about cup padding and support.Cute style thoughBut I love that the design is A-symmetrical.Expensive for what it is.Would prefer slightly heavier material.Package was torn and damaged but boots intact and snug when first put on but have actually stretched and been good so farGreat price, but not worth the quality.They work to keep the piercing from closing when not able to have jewelry in, but on darker skin tones it does not blend very well.She loves the necklace and the assortment of charms is perfect.I wish they had put a spring ring on to make it easier to change the charms.But the necklace is cute.I love how simple it is and that it isn't too obviously a cat.I was disappointed because the lor was perfect.I am a woman with curves.Too bad, it looked so good in the pictures.Loved them otherwise.My nipples fill the space, which looks fine, but does not allow me to clean them well.Beads don't stay in place they go all over the bracelet.But nicely made otherwiseThis sweater is very cuteI gave it to a teenager and he liked it.Great price but not what I was hoping forProduct is fine but very slow shipping.Warm and zy but the fit is off.It was very mfortable and I got lots of mpliments.good quality and works well but not worth the price I'm ' " so not a good choice for taller ladies.Quick fast shipping beautiful ring so many mplement however, lost a diamond on top, only used about Times.The Earrings themselves I love.I need to be more familiar with overseas sizing when looking at these dresses.One of the jewels had fallen out of the bracket on one of the earrings.Nice and warm.The ears are good quality and the llar fits around my neck thank goodness for velcro).Top is see-thru and does not stay in place very well.These are soft and I like them but they don't hold their shape they stretch out easyLoved it, but it turned brass very quickly; but for the price that was paid that was expectedSeemy to be really good quality especially for the price,however not happy with the size of emI love the shirtreally loved the lor and they were very soft.They're just not mfortable.It's mfortable and will be wearing it a lot this summer.Nice case, although the watch molds" which you use to clasp your watches around are too large and made of a solid material.The lor is deep and bright, and the wristlet looks rather high quality.Beautiful bag Other than the sizing being off these sports bras were pretty mfy had good support.I love the design so I will still where them.I love oversized purses and this one fits the bill.then the zipper on one of the inside pockets where I HAD been storing those items since the back zipper busted broke as well, and I uldn't get to those items without having to cut a hole in the pocket itself.I gave it stars, it's a great piece but prepare to spend a little on alterations.Does not have enough material for a thicker muscular thigh.FIT: The material is thin and mfortable but if you usually buy palazzo pants because the excess material of a palazzo flatters your body type, be advised these pants are form fitting on a curvy body.There is a fair amount of material from the knee down, but no flattering flow from the knee up.The size was spot on and they're tight enough that they don't fall down but they're soft enough that they are really mfortable.Fabric isn't super thick, took forever to arrive, but it fits.Just not zy mfy.I think it still looks good, thoughI bought this as a last minutes piece for my mad hatter splay outfit, so I didn't have time to alter it as I needed to, but I made it work.Quick shipping though, packaging was adequate.Poufy-ier than I was expecting but good qualitySuper cute ring but it has a divot in the mood ring part and it was supposed to me with a mood ring chart, which it didn't.Feel very flat footed.thought it would look a little better than it does.I ordered this along with some Alki'i skirts and the fabric of those skirts was a much better quality.That being said, I still wear these pants a lot, and they are very mfortable.Other than that the hat itself is nice and warm.Pros: The quality is better than I expected at this price point ).It felt mfortable, sewn well.It looks nice but.....time to stick to the brands I know and love.So elegant and pretty.Perfect for my style.uld of been a little more mfortableNot very good material.Unfortunately, her first one broke after several days of wearing it, the reason for the stars.It is very nice looking stume jewelry, though.Beautiful dress.... Just a little bit snug but material good.... even though a little thin.The material is soft to touch and expands to suit your body.i thought the sweater was thicker LOL, but my daughter still loves itIt's very mfortable but the material is very thin.It is soft though and i love the length of the sleeves, falls barely past my wrists with nice big cuffs.This is a good product.not the best materialit's a beautiful dress, but on my '" frame, it drags on the floor.My favorite belt finally needed to be replaced and I looked everywhere for what I now know is called a plaque" design.This belt is just that is of decent quality.LOVE the look of this item.I was very surprised for the price when I received it because it was just so beautiful.Otherwise, ok frame for the price.The quality just isn't the same.These leggings are warm and nice imitation of jeans.Really nice my girl loves it but not so great packaging.Very cute, though otherwise.The white is more of an ivory and doesn't work well if you need a white.Other than that they are a mfortable, soft fabric.it's very tight fitting--i did keep it and it is nice quality.Undistinguished, regular quality and presentation, but it's a cute design.Wasn't quite the quality I had hoped for.Too sparklyOverall, it's a great bag for fitting things like a tablet, planner, books, etc, so I would say the size is its best feature.Otherwise this is a stylish shoe to wear with jeans or a nice dress.Good price but not the best qualityVery well made but not for big chested girls.The jewels are not sewn on very well and there are holes in the tulle.A little more golden than the photo ..Quality was excellent for rhe price but at ft , the medium didn't fit.I love the quality of the leggings.Super excited to wear themThe light worked great but the top light fell out right away and haven't been able to get it to stay in place since.Material and style was great.It is very pretty just wish it wasn't so boxy.TO MUCH MATIRIAL ON TOPFor the price, this bag definitely looks more expensive than it is.The fabric is nice and soft.product was not what i expected, different from the picture viewedNice quality and I'm sorry it didn't fit and I had to return it.I'll still wear it and it's great for the price.So if you are looking for a dress star clear of this product.I love the detail in the back but the arm area and the space in the back between the straps is slightly droopy.The good news for me is that I made it work with the top I wanted it under and it looks great, the back of my other top vered up the drooping.Ugh.. Its made ok, but the lace was not laced up and is very hard to lace it up since the material is so soft..Very warm I absolutely loved them until a hole formed in the Seam of the pants only have had them a month and a halfThe quality and price is fine.It's not a great cut for a tee.Nice tie though.ok qualityOverall if it were a better fit i would keep it only cause it wasn't through prime.... i will stick to my lindy bop dresses.I wish they printed this on a better sized shirt.Not padded as much as I'd hoped but they do work okay.the belt is little bet wide and softthe panties are cute and fit fineI'm sure the patches alone were worth the st of the at.I would have gave it stars but the smell of formaldehyde is so strong that I had to purchase an odor eater kit haven't received it yet, but I sure hope it will take that funky smell out.Beautiful dressIt's tton, so I'm not sure what the other people received.The material is great...very sturdy...great vibrant lours I wish they looked a bit less blingy."Good for short term wear but a little sharp for regular wear.Very mfy runs small and fabric not as nice as expected.For me this is one piece to wear when going out.but have a litter big break but still okayCute shirt.smaller than expected.But this charm is making it really sad, because I wanted the tie fighter on my wrist.light weight fabric, well nstructed.I love how this looks on me, but not mfortable.Affordable interchangeable straps.Looks pretty good and sturdy.I gave them stars because the materials and stitching seemed legit and the price was right.This vest is beautiful and very well made, however it runs very large.But mfortable and wash well.I think the gold is too much in the light, it looks awesome under dim light.The material is great and it's adorable just runs very smallIt seems to be good quality with nice seams and zipper...and the lor is good though.I don't blkame Amazon.But there's not enough cup of support in the top.Nice topIt looks so much better in the picture than it does in person.While they certainly are soft and mfortable, after only one wash I was getting a lot of pilling" on the waist band.Given the high st, I had hoped that they would be more durable.For a secret pal gift it is ok. price was good,so wasn't expecting an expensive piece of jewlery.The elbows are not sewn on well And first one ordered was suede and loved and send one was plastic leather type (Very cute and I love this necklace.I love the feel and pattern of the fabric but this dress isn't cut well enough to fit a pregnant body I'm at months).Doesn't look very good with wrinkles.It's mfortable but basically it's a shirt.Material wise it's almost the same as a tton shirt so if your just lounging around it's not bad but if your swimming where waves uld pull" anything I wouldn't remmend the suitSoft and mfy though.Super cute but very low rise.Lovely material and design, but very small.After a week of use and clasp adjustment, they seem to be staying in place as needed.It's mfortableIt has extra fabric there for rouching effect but it doesn't lay quite right.The polarization wasn't that great, and they didn't last more than a uple months plastic part of frame broke at one of the bridge screws but at this price point none of this was unexpected.It's really mfortable though.It isn't the warmest of hoodies, but should be fine for fall and early winter in the northeast.Not much room for the package.It's made of felt.Looks better in the pictureFor the price I paid, these fit great and are very mfortable.It gives a good look and is decent for the price.The dress is beautiful and full if you add a pettiat underneath like we did I do not have the flattest stomach after having two children so unless I wear something to hide it, my curves' show.A bit revealing n a bit big but beautifulNot that high qualityI really wanted a big blue purse and I thought this was it; I wasn't sold on the price but I thought it was well made so I purchased it.This tag is not ming off easily and I've now created two small holes in my brand new cap.Lovely but to noisyAll that being said, I really love the print and I get so many mpliments on it.This was a cute idea, awesome quality, the black n white pattern is not what I expected, way prettier online then in life.These sunglasses are cute, but they are not exactly as pictured.The ankle elastic is too loose, and so the cuff rides up to below my knee while sleeping in ld weather.I have since bought black lace and sewed " all along the bottom in the hopes of being able to wear it.Great Design.Fits nice but very cheap material.I always thought bodyn dresses were a much thicker material.Very pretty but the beads to do stay in place.It doesn't go with the cute light and airy lace in the back at all.Buy your regular size, this is loose and hangs off me, but I put a belt on it and it looks good that way, though I wanted to wear it loose.The blouse I got was virtually the same in every detail except the fabric ntent--chiffon instead of poly/tton blend.I can wear the chiffon, and it's quite pretty, but I would much prefer a tton blend.Mesh fabric and style are nice, but pouch is too small for me and that fabric does not give enough to mpensate.This belly wrap worked great for the first week.It gave great support and I did noticed my belly shrinking within the first week.I'm not especially curvy, but i do have some curves.Material is nice, but the cut of the torso is short.They are pretty and I received mpliments on them.Super ol and good quality.No tag and not as flowy as the pictureThe dress looks great though.The belt is cute and the material feels durable.The bow is stiff fabric but that just helps it look need and tidy.Would be fine if the quality was a little better.The fabric is really soft and are mfortable except for the waist band.I'm not a small woman, in fact the first at i ordered in a X because i wanted a mfortable fit with some room for thicker sweaters or layers and i thought that X would give me that.On the plus side, It does seem kind of warm and if you uld solve the size mystery seems like it would be a really mfortable weekend at.So if roominess takes priority over style then this at will definitely give you the room.it's okay for play but seems expensive for what it is.But for the very cheap price, I guess it's a good dealNice plugs, especially for the price.I really like my TYR trunks, but at - a pair, they're a bit on the pricey side to essentially be used as underwear, so I decided to try some cheaper options.The stitching seemed fine at first, but I'm getting stray threads here and there, and I know I'll be at them with a needle and thread soon.They are very light light and do not stay in your ear.I love the ld shoulder cut and this one is well placed.But the knit is nice, it is attractive, and it is affordable.That might be suitable for a a growing boy but not for a mature man who doesn't want to hang out.I loved the look of this but I'd you have a fuller behind on you this won't work out to well.The material just isn't stretchy enough.Watch is beautifulI was expecting for this credit card wallet to be better quality then it was.Nice case, glasses are not real sold.Nice feeling materialI do love love these earrings and get a lot of mplimentsCute shoes.Will work for a while but I thought Champion made a much better quality shoe than was done so with this pair.Very mfortable but the slipper stretches out which make them big.This ring is very sparkly and pretty, but the stones stick up too high for my liking.Nice soft braThe material was thinner on the top then on the bottom but I think a petite figure would love everything about the dress.Overall not flattering.It's nice qualitySuper cute socks.Great designs.Completely see thru.It looks great with this crop top.I have not worn this by itself.But it does look good with nothing over it.Beautiful necklace.Not exactly as it is pictured.I received a milk cholate and Carmel in the fabric not dark cholate and creamAnd yes, it's noticeable.Thankfully, I sew so I'm just going to remove the lining and put it back in rrectly.Otherwise, this skirt is beautiful.love it but I wasn't excepting it to be sheer material.great stylebad quality, it is so I don't expect it would look like a leather jacket.Overall it was good for the price.I honestly live the at and despite the rips I have no issues.Good bottom verage which is appreciated as that is hard to find nowadays.Not natural looking.Adhesive begins to show.It's pretty and I'm excited to wear it.In order to ensure that quality is guaranteed.skirt is a little too long and the skirt is too flared too much fabric) which makes it heavier when wet, but it fits well.The quality overall is OK for the price Feels like a nice jacket.It would still be mfy to sleep in.Specifically the movement of the purse.It was too flexible for me.I was finally able to get it out, but it took some doing and I don't feel that I should have to work to get stains out of something I bought new.I would remmend getting this, especially for the price, just know that you may have to put some effort into getting it ready to wear.Packaging was easy to get into as it was just an envelopeIt can't even be worn when it arrives because you have to spend forever ironing out the folds they make, reshaping the crushed flower and re shaping the hat to fit properly.Besides that, it is a really nice bathing suit, feels well made and it has support cups in the bust.The cut is nice, flattering as pictured.I find rompers are often not flattering and look sort of boxy but this one is really nice.Ring that holds pendant to the chain arrived open.They are listed on Amazon as Baban .-.mm Watchmakers Tools Quality Set Screwdrivers Including spare heads" They DO NOT me with any spare heads.Nice quality and looked like it would be mfortable.I liked the look and feel of material, but since it was kind of all at the arm holes.Other than that, I have received many mpliments on the dress and it fits well and is stretchy fabric.The style look nice but the material I don't like.It's not as ol as the photos show.Fabric is okay.Not for small people in shape, decent material but better for women who need to find and tuck away stuff but mfortableVery mfortable and thick, but useless without treads at this point in his life.The material was not what I thought it was.They are thick and will be hot for gigs in Arizona.This stume cannot be worn it can only be kept on the baby's bottom and the baby must be expected to stay absolutely stationary.It's also very thin so it will be nice in the summer, but the white linen is fairly translucent.I purchased a Large hoping for a little give as I am and just don't have time to sacrifice mfort for style.It did have a chemical smell, but I'm sure it just needs to be washed.I like it overall though It's fairly soft and mfortable Fabric is good too.The only problem: the clips won't stayBikini tops are always a struggle for me but I gave this a shot anyway ordered the XL.Overall, it's fine.It is sleepwear after all.But they look really good and are good to protect your hands from the elements.Overall the quality was exceptional for the price received before estimated delivery.Nice dress, great price, its a little simple, but for the price really a good bargain.Item came as described, however leather material on outside was not durable enough and is starting to wear after a few weeks of use.Love the blouse's look.They're perfect for an evening gown.It was not easy taking it out of the plastic package.Looks lovely, but sticks up off of the finger about a mile.The fabric is attractive and the top appears well-nstructed but I will have to return the top due to the fit.Not enough room for my equipment.And it's real leatherCheap look material but nice for the pricematerial is a little cheap but as long as your not pulling hard where the seems are, it will be fine// I have to amend my review a bit.. the shirt was a good quality and looked awesome..It's very pretty, I love the flowers.Took out the lace and now it looks much betterThe grip on the elastic is nice.Feels very secure.The leather braided band had more of a sheen than I expected, and my stones were a little loose, so I'm not sure how long it will last.The short chain was already attached, and I loved it.Attention to detail was not a priority based on my purchase and overall impression.The derative seams along the outside of the legs were perfect.If you order these, be sure to check the stitching to make sure it is intact.I love the shirt, but I can't wear it.I purchased this at the beginning of my pregnancy weeks) in anticipation of my clothes not being able to fit.At weeks, a little earlier than I expected, I was no longer able to button my pants, and it was at this time that I decided to bust out the Bellaband that I had waited to wearMaternity pants are much more worth it, just save yourself the trouble and go get them and enjoy your growing bellyMaterial quality feels decent for the price.The shirt itself is decent quality, I'd say middle of the pack, not super soft, but not sand paper.very skimpy bottomsI don't think these are worth more than , but I did buy different lors in the % tton fabric.This is a good quality workout shirt.For one thing, there are two different flower patterns being modeled in the product's photos, so I was curious to see which one I would actually get.Nice product for the price.I'd advise the maker to use a denser fabric, and sew a hem on the top material to give better support).It's really not worth price tag, but its' design is great.Just make it with denser material, and hem the several yards of material you used for the top, and you'll have a much better suit.Fabric llects lint and hair very easy.But it is very mfortable.I am able to make this shirt work, but it was definitely off.We will see how well this holds up to washings and wear.They do seem well made, but the main reason I bought them was for the mfort waist.When I opened the package the chain immediately broke and then I had to get a new chain so the chain is not very resistant although this necklace is really stylish.A lot more flowy" than expected.Good necklace.Heavy earringsThe only thing I dislike is the side pockets will not stay fastenedBeautiful, was shorter than I thought though I am ' and only fell to my waist, but overall nice for the priceAfter I find a day to cut off the extra length on the straps and sew it together, I will be happy with the top.Nice quality hatI wish it had more mpartments though.These look a lot more faded than I expected, so that's fine if that's what you're going for.They are very well made.Fairly made.Perfect Mexi/Hawaii dress.This is more necklace than expected.Bery dramatic piece but not a lot of sparkle.Overall craftsmanship uld have been a little better.It was well made and the fabric was nice, just wish there was a zipper in the back as well as the lacing.I got a pair of Margaret Emer pants through Stitch Fix but wasn't willing to pay the to purchase, so I found these as an alternative.If you want something thicket and better quality, I would look elsewhere.Beautiful material and very pretty.Very cut and fairly mfortable.It doesn't have a lot of stretch to it, but it is mfortable.The heart has faded though after several washes.Overall an okay but, but due to the fading I would not buy again.Otherwise, it is fine.The detail is really well done, so much so I actually though the little shirt had lace sewn on the front to make it stand out.Clear nail polish worksThe quality of the fabric is nice but definitely better on the shirt than the pants.You'll definitely need a slip to wear underneath.Quality Is Fine.Looks Richer In Pic.looks fine from far away but close up the details are all messy and some of them were messed up and then you can see where they fixed it but not very wellJust make sure to wash them on the gentle cycle and hang dry if you want the lace to stay put.This is lightweight and the lor was great--but I found it to be tight and the material very clingy.and once to a wedding, and they hung on very mfortably.I think I will get a few more wears out of these but they're not terrifically durable.I thought this was engraved and it is not.It looks like a mattress designBut it's a nice sweater so I am giving it away to a taller friend.These slippers are super mfortable at first...like walking on clouds.After washing them, they mated on the inside making them no better than socks.I brushed out the wool on the inside and that helped nsiderably but this defect takes away from their awesomeness.You can see through them easily.washed in ld water tumble dry/ shrunk to large size, they were x..in grey/ white shrunk to x.. good thing I didn't use hot It is a smidge wide in the arms but she said it is very soft and mfy.Fabric is rough against the neck, not mfortableI already soak and wash it in hot water to see if it would be less staining.Is a lot better than just plain underware.The glasses were great but the iPhone case does not protect your phone at allThese aren't the same fabric as before but I think that they will fit better eventually too.the rest of the shirt is mfortableNot the highest quality made product.bought it as a gift for a friend, that friend really enjoyed the detail and loves to wear the ear rings.I purchased this as a shirt clip, you know; you have a shirt that's rather larger in the back and you want a more fitted look..Yes this product is stretchy and uld look great on some bodies.It is mfortable, stretch and not see through at all tho.It is cute, but it looks inexpensive.Th leather/material is not soft to touch,.But besides: it's a real leather, and plenti of pockets.It was less than when I purchased it, so what exactly was I expecting the quality to beWould've been great if it weren't to loose.Not mfortable item.Pretty good brushI love the fit, the lor, the light weight fabric perfect for spring the way they roll up and stay up for walking through the surf, and, of urse, the mfort.This was not the case with the bootcut indigo Pajamajeans that I ordered previously.LOVED these, but they mpletely unraveled and bound my laundry into one huge knot once I washed them.If the band were more adjustable I would have kept itI can add a piece of elastic to make it more mfortable.Otherwise it is a lovely skirtGreat idea, too delicate and keep breaking.Doesn't feel great and is hard to work with.The fabric was a lovely lor, and it was very soft.quality just okayI really love the look of this necklace.It's really quite large and the goldtone is really vivid, which absolutely works for me.This however is a great looking necklace really big, shiny and bold love it...It looks like a clear cubic zirnia at first and I also needed to examine it closely to make out the fact that it was a Cladagh ring.cute with a sweater over it.I had a bamboo one with my first pregnancy which was very soft.I'm hopeful it will work as well as my bamboo one.It was exactly what I was looking for, and I uldn't zip it.Jacket looks great and quality feels good.My wife doesnt like the fabric, she says it fits okay..They are inexpensive, and you do get what you pay for.Like it was a good st for the quality and quantityThe white washes nicely but the lacy linings my daughter finds itchy and they've started to unravel after just a few wears and washes.Fabric was beautiful.Tool box was excellent with their refund.It works for what I want but I'm not really happy with the quality of the silver" finish.Batteries last long enough for at least hours.After that everything was greatIt is very pretty and for the price it is hard to beat.I have a llection of really cheep and really expensive rsets.At this is a very inexpensive rset.The steel boned wires are not very sturdy and it is only one layer of material.Doesn't look the best on me but oh well.Otherwise they are great.The back pack is ol looking and different than what's out there, but the dimensions of the little pocket aren't mpatible with the space needed for the zipper to close.Simple fabric.Well, it definitely looks better in the picture.I'm not thrilled with the quality of the tee as it's pilling getting little fabric balls) across the front after a few washes and wears.Looks nicer in photo.The fabric of this sweater is very soft and the design is cute.It is a beautiful set and the lor is fantastic but all the stones fell out.These looked nice and I would've kept them had my favorite one not been missing the pin upon arrival.But cute bag.The cups are a little small and have no support but over all the lace is nice for the price.Good quality, cheap price, very cute, runs very small, and does NOT fit you if you're tall ladiesOverall it will work but I'm going to have to make a few alterations and hope for the best.cross is nice, but beads are rough and chain is junky.Once I cleaned it all up I glued it back together and it's not perfect, but it's about the quality I expected for ..Looks beautiful, fabric is beautiful and flowy but so disappointed the XL fits more like a medium.The lor and material is great.Its a nice lor and fits as expected but the fabric is very stiff and itchy.They have been overall good until a buckle broke just recently.Other than that they're nice, the material is a lot more substantial than I expected, definitely more jeans like then I expected.They are mfortable but it still feels like you're wearing jeans not leggings.They do the job ... Quality wise, not great ..Really like the material and quality of this dress.Great product otherwise, they just need to be sewn together with stronger thread.Not so mfy, but good for the price-Great priceOk .. Nice for sleeping in can be thin .The olness doesn't outweigh the inability to wear them.To reduce the st they must have done this, believe or not its cheaper to put pleats on the entire shirt than just till the waist line.Is not softer enough, it feels like dog hair just the strands are soft.I thought it was silk screened....great shipping fit her very mfortable just needs a heads up on washing directions ..she is sad because she loved it so much....bless xxIt's well made, otherwise.The designs are goodI really liked it, but needed tools to put it back together after it broke after only a few hours of wear.I would like this necklace so much better if the eyes showed up better.It's cute on top if your pair is perky, but the back side is VERY short and shows a bit of median shadow".It's nothing too major I can't live with though and I'm excited to wear it outThe bottoms are perfect.Leaves neat tan lines.It would have been ok if the white trim allowed some stretch like the rest of the dress.This is not tton but a thin see through tton spandex material feels very close to what a bathing suit is made of).This uld be a cute top for someone on the very slim side that understands that an undershirt would be needed to wear this.In my opinion they are for children not an adult.Cap made good,looks good embroidery looks nice but did have a crease above bill due to shippingVery nice wallet leather is very soft.- The fabric is heavy.I like rayon, but this feels off.I've tailored it, but it's and annoyance to have to do that.I think this is very pretty, and I'll have a lot of nfidence wearing this after I finish tailoring it.It is beautiful thoughFits great, bit quality is on the low sideAs others have said, the card slots are a bit large for credit cards, so they tend to float around and risk falling out, but otherwise, this worked out pretty nicely.The quality isn't amazing, but that makes sense given the price.It's a very beautiful nightgown but I would remmend going up one size.I received this product at a disunt in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.Comfortable dress.Fabric is softNice qualitythey look good on and feel nice as well.Cute for those lazy days that I don't want to touch my hair.I bought it with the intention of sleeping in it; however, it's a little too large for my head so by the end of the night, it's resting on my pillow and not on my head.Its beautifully made for the price.POSTS WERE NOT LONG ENOUGH.I don't feel it's proportioned well.I have a super high arch so the arch support isn't as good as i expected it.Add more arch support and I'll give a higher rating.The sizing for these gloves are not the best, the pair I purchased claim they're good for years through .but the waist band is not supportive and they do not stay up well.I am thinking of doing some reinforcing and alterations on them.Everyone loved the stume, but it was too expensive.I didn't get a chance to wear the jacket in a hardre rainstorm but in a little must it kept me dry.I don't think it would keep me dry for more then a uple minutes In a storm.There are a few youtube vids on how to make this better.I fixed it in about minutes and minimum sewing and it looks % better.I love sleeping beauty but the images are out of focusNot sold on it yet- has a odor" so hopefully in time it will go away- I love the lor so for the price it works.The waist strap in the back doesn't stay very well.Getting out of my fabric chair at work makes it loosen.I over mpensated the clip position to make sure it doesn't me undone.Spend a little more and get something that has fabric that will look great all day long.The fabric is a little polyester like but it's thickness is nice.Was looking forward to this tote, bought in the stone lor.The t-shirts are beautiful, but they are making them too long in length.Very warm.Reasonably priced.Works well with thick shirts clips did not slip.These earrings do not set into my ears but stand out a little which I do not care for.poorly made, but if you have sewing knowledge it's easy to fix, runs small, but still a good shirtI would remmend wearing a slip under it since it's so sheer.The stockings stretched ok, but there is no way that they would stay up.All in all, they are ok for light novelty wear.But not all-night stume quality.Its breathable.The bows fell off within a week but they are cute with or without them.The shirt is really cute and made well but your sizing is not at all nsistent.Comfortable, but a bit too tight.The padding is very thick.With some very tall heels it just grazed the floor.Very nice material.This would totally have stars if the garment had been nstructed rrectly.The design, however is gorgeous and very flattering.I wish I would have paid more attention to the length of the box.It is too short to hold my , , and inch necklaces.It is very cute, accurately represented, and has very detailed features, just not for me.But it is a gorgeous shirt.Quality is so-soBeautiful dress, though the torso was a long fit and the clasp at the top of the neck was hanging barely by a string.Not loving the texture.I'm sure it will be perfect for what I need it for.Purple orchid is not what I was looking for.The quality is fine, it's just a matter of personal preference that I wish they were a bit longer.Would be nice for a lder halloween, this year was warm and he got hot.Material is great and looks wonderful but I'm a little bustier and the zipper in my he back didn't lie smoothly.The shirt's sound meter isn't very powerful.I plan to wear it with another bottom because the top is really nice, mfortable and originalOtherwise, pretty.I purchased the foot loop variety.While they worked, they were unmfortable likely because they uldn't be adjusted any longer than possible.If you are under feet I'd remmend these for sure because they do work as advertised.If you are over, maybe the foot loop variety isn't the best option.It looks noticeably cheaper next to my Pandora charms.However, it's not a cheap bag and for the price I expected it to be good-as-new for quite some time.pretty and softElegantWish I uld get this in good quality.the item looks better in the picture than in realitycheap quality I mean totally expected) but a great layering tee to wear with cardigans and kimonos.The image isn't as sharp and the ntrast of the image isn't as high as the product preview.cheaper metal, the stainless steel has a very youthful appeal, I think I will give to my year old daughterThey are good enough to wear around the house or to a causal outing but not let's say out on a date if you are trying to impress.You're forced to wear the sleeves folded or scrunched, which doesn't stay well with this flexible, manipulable material.It is really mfy so it's actually worth it for me to just fix it up and go from there.Material and make is solid, I think.It is not so beautiful like the picture, I'm not happy about it.They don't offer as much smoothing/slimming/support as other options so they weren't as flattering on me personally.the material is easily strawed out.Easy to use and attractive.great productWill blow off in a mild wind.Bummed when something ordered online isn't a decent quality.I SO wish someone would make this kind of tunic in a heavier weight, better quality material.As well because of it's synthetic fabric or rather loose knit yarn fabric, it is HOT.Looks great but the fit is off do to the materialI was only able to wear it for two days after that the hooks for some reason were bent and I was not able to fix them.this top was so cute for my daughter.However, the cups are very good, nice push up effect and nice fabric.NOT for me but made a great holiday present.Very nice, stylish, mfortable.Cons- The feathers do not lay in a totally pleasing fashion.The hat is sturdy.Not the best quality but worth the moneyI doubt I'll buy another dress made by this mpany.Worth the very low st though.The shirts are cute and mfortable.With how much this dress has st me, I don't think it is worth it.Adorable jewelry set.Beads flew everywhere.It looks great, but the material is not what I expectedI can tell already that this is the kind of quality that is going to force you to buy a new backpack every year.If you are looking for a few months of fun this is a nice option.Made well and I'm sure it would work in other bags.Works well if there is no wind.It is a good quality.But not the best gloves I've purchasedI loved how the glasses looked.I'm sure the product is great when they me intact.The hat was good but I remmend the trucker hat style of it because it seems like a better materialIt looks nice but wish it had some tton in it for breathablity.It is spandex and it hugs I think it is really nice, but I did find it also a bit sheer for my liking.I bought it as a fun joke for next Christmas - now I wonder if its been worn and not washed.She loved the watch at first sight.Buy for the look as that is all you wear it for Would like it to be thicker to use as a at.Sharp looking on.The fabric is on the thinner side but very soft; as plus size - clothing quality is important to keep Smooth and keep all together.There is NO support holding those puppies in though.And the side tie is aesthetic, not functional.Comfortable without being too big or too restricting.First thing I noticed was it wasn't as heavy as the waist cincher I bought a year ago,also it has less bones,the fabric is thinner.Still looks well made though.instead of having two screws to keep the batteries securely inside of it, it only has one.Pieces are little and hard to put together since you have to create the look" yourself.Not Comfortable at all.Otherwise a nice slideI loved these earrings as the style they are perfect for me, but I was hoping that they wouldn't tarnish.I am giving this ring stars because while this ring is SUPER cute and stays in place so well, the opal in my ring fell out after a week of wearing it.Nice but decal is a little foggyIt is mfortable and modest.Not too sure of this one great material and well made but the fit is off.I'm a A, and the bra padding itself is removable and surprisingly really nice.For me, the bust is a little big, but the material is mfortable/stretchy and it doesn't really matter.The material is mfortable and is a beautiful lor.Quality was ok.I still use it, it looks OKMy son loves these years old) but by the end of the day they are very stretched out due to the material type.They are soft mfortable but definitely lose their shape the longer they're worn.These sets are mfortable I use them for around the house and pjs for now.The material is ok for outdoor in spring and fall but not winter to thin.Not crazy about this particular necklace.BOO NICE MATERIAL THOUGH AND LOVED THE WHEELS GAVE IT TO SOMEONE WITH A SMALLER TREE.Would have liked the sweaters to last a bit longer.She said it was mfortable and you uld wear it all day.The jumpsuit is made with a different material than I expected but it still fits me okay.After months the stone will fall out on its own.Very nicely made although totally sheer.The neckline is not modest and if you need any verage over there I would not remmend this dress.Form is off, but overall the design of the hat is nice.Had to return, looked great but not enough support.The seem like they would be better in the front or set up differently.Nice to wear around for fun or ol evening wear not good to sleep inMaterial is nice but I don't like the snaps.It is a nice design.This top came quickly and in good ndition.I'm not as skinny as the girl in the picture and I have a large chest so I feel like I'm on the fence of it looking good.The beads are red and green only the adornments are lovely but never so lively as the picture.Wife loved the top.The earrings are very pretty.Anyway I gave it stars because it is well made and a very pretty rset.It is of decent quality but they did not picture the rear of the suit and now i know why; it is a Brazilian cut.This soft and lovely scarf arrived sans the mentioned key-ring."That said, this is a beautiful scarf and well worth the excessively long wait.And once stretched over your rings, it does not hug your finger.mmmmOther than that, the material was in perfect bathing suit material, I received lots of mpliments, and lor and image provided was true.It was not the same material as expected.Good material but it was HUGE on me.Not sure why it's so hard to find an American flag one-piece so it's good enough for me to keep and just wear in my backyard or friends.It's elegant but the fabric is too lightOk, not the best out there, but you get a good quality for the price.This little tote is a very nice lor, but looks alot cheaper than the photo shown, but then again, the item was only about ., so it's fair.The shoulder straps are too large and the quality is not greatThe ziper pulls me off easily thoughTop is very cute, but it's sheer, you definitely have to have an undershirt.This set is lovely and of great quality.Nice and thin for spring ming up too.The sleeves are nice and long though and they have thumb holes; which I didn't know before purchase and was pleasently suprised aboutI didn't realize it when I purchased but I think it's a cute addition.I like the fabric and I think I would like the look of them if they fit rrectly.You aren't supposed to wear them until your incision heals and then it's remmended to wear them every day for months for maximum benefitThe magnetic clasp is not as easy to nnect if you don't get it just right.Material is questionable, but it will do just fine for the beach over my swim suit/ just because my best friend loved the idea of the necklace.Plus they are not particularly attractive.Love these glasses, these are my send pair.Cute designed racerback work-out top, but... the material is heavy and not nducive to warmer weather climates.I would use it for hours straight so maybe that was the problem but I liked how fast it was shipped and the packaging it came in.wish it had mpartments and pockets.Nice hats but nowhere near as slouchy as advertisedLooks nice in the picture but it's much cheaper looking in real life.I have not inserted the studs into a piercing yet, but they arrived timely and look fashionable.I'm a fan of bolder jewelry and this is pretty dainty.Decent for the price.Its lace on top with a satin like fabric underneath.Stretchy soft fabric.Product is pretty and indeed silver, however fragile as well.Great summer bagNot as sturdy as I hopedThe dress appears to be well made and the fabric has a nice weight to it.I'm '" and measure " from shoulder to floor so this doesn't work, even if I'm not wearing heels.Mine is more gold than rose gold, but still a pretty ring.The material is very light weight but surprisingly does not ball up like I thought it would.The picture does the blouse more justice, the blouse was nice but quality wasn't great.Very mfortable material...These pajama jeans are super mfortable.As for the style, while they uld certainly pass for jeans if you decide to wear them out of the house, they aren't what I nsider stylish, and the fabric is not attractive.At that price, I had hoped they'd be really cute, AND mfortable.I am grateful I am good at working on stains.I did not receive the micro fiber bags for the sunglasses.Not super impressed with this item.The quality is great but the waist band is huge.The wallet is good quality and design, but it is too big in my opinion.Cute dress but not worth roughly in my opinion.Great quality, that's just not something I'd usually spend for a casual dress.it is very beautiful thoughThe outfit is super cute and mfy.The design, however, is just perfect and very flattering on.It was cute while it lasted, but it was not great quality.Great gift, just watch the pricing.It was very cute and a great price.It's a nice shirt, but too loose for me.It isn't as figure flattering as I expected, but it was better than a plain Tee when I wanted to just relax.The material is what I expected for the price.If you want a dress that looks exactly like the one in the photo, try a splay website, where items are more expensive but are much more realistic and made better.But they're definitely not waterproof.Maybe the pocket liners but that's it.Still an overall ol design.Very beautiful necklace butt unfortunately it fell apart at the clasp.Good fake but still fake.Other than that great value for the price.Otherwise a good product.Not as sturdy as I would like.This is certain for fashion, and no extended wear.The material is good quality and soft.I had to have it altered, looks much better now.Doesn't need a pettiat, but looks much fuller with one.Other than that, it seems to be of good quality.This is a really cute skirt and shirt set.Overall, I'm not terribly impressed by the quality but my son likes them.After some bending and adjustments I got the stems just right.They look pretty ol on, but they are heavy.Loved the design, Good quality.Love the jacket for the price I paid.I do wish the jacket was made with a thicker lining.Cute dress and awesome material thoughA little too floppy especially when it gets wet, but the tie is great.Good for the price but already a little worn since washing a few timesThe velcro uld be stronger, however, which is why I am only giving it stars.I doubt I will use this as often as I planned, but it will go with many other piecespour quality, see throughSuper softOnly mplaint is the ends are not rounded and were a bit sharp.I think it may be a little off center.But overall I'd say I'm happy with it for the price.It's doing the trick for the outfit I need but I needed to belt it with a sparkly black sash) to make it truly work.It runs large, fabric is ok, is a see thru, more like to be mfortable at home in a hot summerThe fabric was not what was expected, Too much like PJ fleece material.NO where near as elegant as it looksThis cardigan was not nearly as long as I thought it would be, but decent little cardigan for the price.The quality overall I'd rate /.Looked great.Beautiful dress but too long for meThis would be great if it weren't for the center strap.Feel of fabricShirt came on time and seemed to be good quality.It's like a formaldehyde scent and I don't know how to get rid of it but for aesthetics same it's an okay buyAs for a non iron shirt, it still needs to be ironed.Good product.The actual shirt is very cute and mfortable although it is a bit low cut for me.Good quality, good for the price.Honestly these are shiny and very slick.For the print I wish they were more if a soft or flannel like fabric.Could be stitched better.Comfortable and fairly breathable.I dropped it once and it did crack pretty easy but it still functions and looks good.This shirt is super soft and appears to be made of good quality material.Overall this is a great tank; perfect for the summerThe lor of the bag looks prettier in the picture the bag took time to be deliveredThe brush quality and quality of the Polish is low.I would remmend spending a little more for quality polish and brushes.Leggings not included, leg warmers not included.It was beautiful, simple, perfect.. till it broke after only the send time wearing it.Nice ring but it has layers in order to have the wire in there and it's already seperating.Would buy the same dress in a different fabric, but hopefully it's more accurate to the photo.i don't like the fact that the back is not all lace but its ok for the priceThis bag overall seems well made, but as noted by other reviewers the shinyness of the bag was just to much for my tastes.The shirt itself is thick material.It looks a lot cheaper in person than the pictures online but I still like the strappy back.The fabric is so soft and thin.Once on it is ok but I was expecting better quality.Not real jewelry; it was plastic.It's ok, doesn't look quite as nice in person as on lineI wish the edges had a binding.The sleeves are made of a mesh material with glitter so I don't think it is as mfortable as some of her other pj's.Great Customer's service.They were very helpful, though and offered to repay me for any alterations I needed.Comfortable flowy material for all shapes and sizes.My husband has several Cutter and Buck shirts so I was expecting a higher quality of tton knit.Otherwise if that's what your looking for the shirt is nice material and nice style.Its pretty but the fabric is a little cheesy...A uple of them weren't able to have the balls on them cause they were stripped overall there nice I got about marijuana ones )It is bone white.It has both a solid headband and an elastic band to secure the hat.If you're crafty and can attach mbs to the ends of the headband, that would probably help to hold it in place.It was well made.I live in Chicago so I need a sturdy, warm hat and this one is just ok.The reason for the stars is the straps.Stone came out the first week.Fabric is heavy and thick.The quality of this is not very high.Very cute designs though.Otherwise the scarf is well-made, and will still look great with some outfits.I bought this after having a baby and it is both unflattering and not the most mfortable.The quality is fine, nothing spectacular.If you are looking for a gown, you'll probably be better off spending more for better quality.I don't find it sharp on the edges, also stated in other reviews.I accept the limits of how much it can hold and the limited space.Going in to the purchase I already accepted as fact that it would be an effective blocker and had a limited amount of holding space, but the selling point from me was it's sleek and ol design.They are okay.. but get stringy and aren't the best quality.these belts are so so quality, low price so don't expect much.This is the cheap knock off to the very popular Zara cat ear hat from a few seasons ago.Its a good quality very warm hoodie and I loved the teal blue lour.The fleecy lining is really nice and is on the arms toootherwise it is really cute and good quality.Love this necklace, wear it daily and get mpliments on how nice I smell : DID NOT COME WITH BAG OR FELT PADS -bracelet and the earrings are a lighter shading.Looks better in pictures than it does in real life.Doesn't retain its elasticity as well as i would like but it looks nice and was as expected when I received it Otherwise, I'm sure those who don't squat as much will love this.Otherwise then that beautifully shirt.The backings don't stay onGreener when I'm the shadows, brighter blue in the light.Not what I expected for the priceReally cute idea, and the pictures are beautiful.It IS true to the pictures but is honestly a little lack luster in person.Anyway the ncept is adorable, it's just not as beautiful on.I wasn't very impressed with the quality of the print.Definitely worth the price and the quality is great, just be careful what print you order.Great style.nice, but detail makes little unclear what it really is- which is a volleyballIts really cute but ripped at the top with only wearing it - times.simple fabricVery cute socks.Product was flawless when I received it..Soft Leather means thin leather.Feels like vinyl.The shirt is made well.The material is strong.These are perfect in terms of height, but I'm not a fan of the material.They are mfortable though, and after several washes, the elastic is still doing its job and keeping the pants up.Love the hat, nice looking, good quality, but still can't decide if I like how it fits/looks when on.Looks a bit different in real life.I wouldn't feel mfortable wearing this dress to a nice event I think I would feel too cheap, even if the fit was stellar which it was not...).I liked the back the straps looked pretty but the straps were a bit too spacious on me, so they ended up draping a bit.The dress does not flare out as in the photo.It was more of a straight line with a subtle flare.My rating was based only on the quality of the gown.I don't have a problem with the quality or fit of the hat... but I do have a problem with the lor of the advertised hat.Meh-- the print up by the waist band looks totally fake, fine easily vered by a long shirt.I absolutely love the opal stone, and the stainless steel was a big deal for me since I am allergic to most jewelry.Great shoes, easy to put on and take off, sole mpletely tore away from shoe after months of a year old wearing them.I love the style and it is a good quality shirt.The quality of it also doesn't feel very nice, but the fish itself is very cute.Well made and love the lor super thin for the price.Nice lor and pretty fabric but it is HUGE- it looks like a MOOMOO ( not at all flattering, Not sure how it looks so cute on the model?This dress has a lot of potential if it was made a bit different.The bottom part is nice and sexy, although you can't really see the leg as much as shown on the photo.If you loose sunglasses on a daily basis like I do, these are perfect for you.The less expensive item was much better.I will have to layer more than what I anticipated.Fabric is a tad scratchy and stiff,hopefully after a wash it will be better.It's nice pattern/material.Tassels were to long so I had to trim them.Nice skirt.More white than ivory.Thought it would be tton like the pic.Feels silky so am keeping it for a dressier look but still wish it were tton for more casual wear.I liked this bunting back because it seems soft and zy.The fabric is a little scratchy and not very lacy.They are really hard to bend which may or may not be good for you.Good support, but not the right suit for me.They are pretty and stylish.Product not as pictured, but nice regardless.The chain is a gaudy yellow gold and I can't mment on the quality as I gave it away and replaced it with a longer more delicate gold chain, but the pendant is nice size and quality.They look lovely and came fast, just uldn't fit them.. Review update: I just recently lost some weight, so know I can fit them and let me say there adorableI wanted more of a leggings fitted but denim material.Really nice fabric, great lors.I think I'll use it for walks after dark, and for riding my bike to work.Nice looking shirt but not the best qualityLoved the style, but only in the picture.Is inexpensive and looks it.The chain faded quickly so if you purchase this make sure to get a different chain for it.ManageableIt is beautiful though.But it is definitely made with hot glueThe quality is just ok; I don't think it would last a lot of wears for multiple seasons, but for infrequent wear, it would probably be great.In addition, the llars all get very limp and puckered after several washings...something even a good ironing won't mpletely remedy.It doesn't matter if you rub a freshly cut lemon wedge into the spots that usually even keeps ink from setting into white shirtsWorth the price though and well made.The quality was not bad, but a little bit tight under the arms for me which makes it not as mfortable as I expected.It does not seem very durable, hoping it will last for a uple of Halloweens.For the price, it's as expected.Material is pretty though.It is very pretty, but super see through in bright light.Leaves fluffy lint on everything it touches.I absolutely love the quality and fit of this jacket.Lace pockets are adorable.It's unmfortable and gets hot make u sweat.it's like a polythene bag.not nice productIt was cream.I felt that there wasn't adequate mpression.The shirt is very nicely made and looks good.It must have been designed for Asian people.The length is great, skirt flair is lovely for hiding those hips, and the fabric has a nice amount of stretch to it.I do like the mesh- lets my boys breathe.Inexpensive but looked great.Perfect for what I neededThe romper was cute... And nicely made..No breast pads.I was expecting a more sturdy material and not fishnet, but the purpose was for it to be aesthetically pleasing and for my husbands excitement.In that aspect, it definitely excelled.They still look good and have held together well but I just wish that the gold loring had stayed.Not a single trace of it is gold but I still love it and wear it almost every day.The train is long and beautiful.For other uses, they are fine.This top is a cute pink but the material looks and feels like a nightie.It is mfortable against the skin but I am not sure if i will be able to wear it out since it's see-through as well.These fit great right out of the dryer and are so cute and super mfortableI like the look, but I wasn't expecting too much of Romwe quality, since I have purchased from this seller before.NOt a very good quality, it looks prettier on the website.Great quality hat the fur is great and warm.The material seems thick and of decent quality.Not mfortable for american men.This sweatshirt came on time and looks great, great quality.Was hoping it'd be looser fitting like shown, but it's fairly tight.Still mfortable though.The material is okay, but nothing fancy.Nice item for the money.It's a good product but I didn't use it nearly as much as I expected.It stays in place well when you're standing since it has those grip strips.The material is good, but the sewing is bad, many stiches are loose not aligned wellOK, this is a very flattering cut, fit as expected and has a sexy low cut.Cute ncept though.Great shirt.Since my baby gas sensitive skin, I have to wash all of my clothes before I let him near me.They have great customer service.Was hoping it would be more flowing, more fabric.it okay, material not as soft as expected.perfect to keep you hair dry between the stores and your car.These alligator pajamas are pretty adorable, but the lor faded after a uple washes.Pretty top, if it will stay putFabric is nice and lightweight, but doesn't breathe.the dress is beautiful and wonderfully made but the fabric is unforgiving and the fit is a little small.There's not much give in the crotch and the mesh is not made for ample ntainment.Once the crotch was gone it made it a lot more mfortable.Oh something else I would like to add is that the material is nice and soft but you will see your panties, and another thing I like is the lor.On the other hand, it was made well.Great laces.Better than quality than the original.It's better to just get an expensive ring resized, but for the cheaper rings, this is okay.Arrived in good ndition for the price but the shoe was too big for my baby's feet.Cute and affordable.Perfect I love itReally gorgeous fabric and a lovely style.In the photo it looks as if there's more fabric for a fuller cut.I'll wear it but I won't be buying from any of these vendors again.Still a good purchase but would have really raved about this hat if the proportions were better crafted.It was made well but it just didn't work for me.I take this bag everywhere and it is fashionable and very functionalThe skirt is nice and long though, which I enjoyTangles very easy would only buy if you're extermly carefulThey are the best and the teal lenses make the tennis ball stand out.The dress had some hanging strings and the neckline was cut deeper than I expected, but other than that it's perfect and not tight at all.It drapes nicely.Nice hoodie, but the one shipped to me was Pine, not charal.I'm a huge Loungefly fan and love Star Wars so I HAD to have this bag.I love the bag, but I'm just a little disappointed with the quality of the printing.Loved the top.The bottom is see through....NOT GOOD for wearing anywhere except a nude beach.I'm giving three stars because the frames were perfect and exactly what I was looking for BUT the glasses are too wide so they keep slipping off of my face.Short in the arms but overall very warmUsed for MN winter this year and my head was nice and toasty.Works pretty well but the hinge is weak and breaks after a few months of use.The quality of the shirt is fine.I can't describe the exact smell it reminds me of as it probably would not let it post.I had an inexpensive purse not long ago with the same odor, got rid of it due to not being able tolerate it.Very bright lights, and granddaughter loves them.Nice to wear under clothes for a smooth look.Really expensive for a pair of long socks.Pants quality was satisfactory, size was not.Perfect to go under a sweater vest for my daughter.The item is as pictured but a lot thicker than I would have guessed, It sits about at least) times higher than a normal snap charm.There was also not a lot of stretch in the belly area and it up not being able to wear itThe shirt fabric was as adequate, as expected.Next time I will opt to purchase the items separately in an effort to find a higher quality fabrics.If you plan to make use of the tux more than just on a rare occasion I'd nsider thinking of the studs and cufflinks as your jewelry; there were several options available to reflect class and personal style.Great quality just bigger than I expectedDoesn't seem like the best material.Although this is cute and actually good material, it is HUGE.I bought this white tungsten carbide ring for my boyfriend because we got each other promise rings and he absolutely loves it.This ring is soft, and shiny, he gets mpliments.he never takes it off, it's durable, and doesn't scratch/ i i honestly don't think he's taken it off since i gave it to him for christmas.Very stylish.The drape adds the lor for the back.Not a quality material.i like the lenth but looks too bulky for my taste, but its really mfortable and warmIt's a very pretty shirt, and it's good quality.Hopefully they'll loosen up a bit.It is tighter than my other workout shirts and mpresses my bustline.Pretty dress, but description should list that the dress is tea length.By the picture we thought it was going to be full length.Not A material, but my son has turned into a jogger/"I wanna be mfy" type of guy, so good for hanging around home, quick run to Walmart or even to sleep inI love the way it looks however; I thought it would be thicker..it's very thin and won't keep anyone warmBut it wasn't that expensive.Was perfect for his needsThey look exactly like the picture and are warm.However they are very scratchy inside.Good light material.Product was as described but she was a little disappointed because she owns a short sleeve shirt from Roamans and its material is thicker than the long sleeve shirt she received.Good for mild arch support, but not for plantar fascitous.Love the pattern, and the bottoms are cut perfectly for a new mom.The padding on the top makes your boobs look like you're in a Madonna bra with a high point to them.The back has a funky fastener and isn't adjustable either.Packaging needs improvement.I love these the only problem is the clasp and chain.Other than that, I like the soft leather.I love the material and the flow of this shirt.First off, these are gorgeous and heavy and seemingly very well made.The arches are too high for me.Other than that, the items are well worth the price and absolutely serve the purpose.In a rating of - being excellent and garbage I rate it a .Hopefully they will stretch and loosen up with wear.I got this and its lovely.This shirt is more tton/silky like.The fit is good and they are mfortable to wearThe material is nice and thick but that makes them a little hot.These would be perfect winter weight pants but not great for working out in temps over .I get hot easily so these are not good for summer time workouts but they are mfy for lounging and errands.These gloves are so cute, they're probably the most stylish gloves I own.I'm not nvinced this is real leather.I had to do some sewing which I am horrible at) so they work to a point now but, I was not very happy with the shorts craftsmanship right out of the box.My wife loved them, but hated that they take so long to ship.But the quality is good for inexpensive jewlery... Go figure.The length of the socks were a bit shorter than described but they were semi durable for a uple uses but developed holes quickly Too bulky, my son wasn't mfortable wearing them.Soft material but it is thin.After it was washed, it was just fine.The watch took about . months to be delivered, and the end result was that the watch was teach our kid to tell time with her favorite superhero, that's out the window now.For the price it's a great disposable necklace.There isn't enough structure there was a lot of bendingOkay, these are hands-down adorable shoes.And, the right shoe straps were too big for my foot, while the left was fine.So much potential, but the little things make them not my favorite pair.Feels good just moves too muchBeautiful bracelet.Did not receive the panties that were pictured.Gives great verage and the softness is nice feel.Looks different than the picture *Otherwise, this was cute and mfy, medium weight fabric, zy fleeceVery pretty gift for my granddaughter.It is stume jewelry.Not great quality Would be good for a stume, but not every day wear.Looks better in pic.A lot of loose threads but slippers do stay on heels better than other slippers I had.This romper is super cute and very well made, but it was way too big for my daughter.Very pretty and like that the flower is free flowing inside, the chain is pretty that mes with it, but it would be better as a key chain maybe rather then necklace just due to weight of the pieceDefinitely for casual wear.Look nice, but of less quality of other Megia watches I've purchased.Very good material.VERY soft and luxurious feelNicely lined.Great top to wear around Halloween or Thanksgiving.I gave it stars because it fits a little big on me and the material is not breathableI'd call the fit relaxed' because it's not like the picture at the waist, but the looseness is mfortable in the heat, though not very flattering.The print is pretty and great camouflage if you have little ones.Good quality fabric and workmanship.Very thick so good for winter, not good for summer.These are definitely not made to last.Very soft and kind of see thru.Nice quality I thought the material would have been knittedIt's more of a cuff style bracelet than a wrap.Not high quality but cute.The wooden beads are small, light, and not as lustrous as I expected in the photo.They do have a light varnish for shine.The beads probably st a dollar, including the silver-tone ones.I like the material of the sweater.The quality of the product his not that well call the PD I think leather is pleather printing I thought it was going to be stitched in letters overall to Stars.Cute, simple but not the best qualityI really like this watch and I think it's beautifully made.Love this bra.The dress is made quite well has an inner liner.Zipper is a little hard to maneuver, but I will only wear this a time or two so that shouldn't be a real issue.I don't like the quality of the metal.I gave it stars because it would be good for a teen or someone who doesn't need/care about wearing a higher quality metal.The material is of medium weight, so not particularly warm but nsiderably heavier than a regular long sleeved shirt.It's fits like a glove and it would be great when it starts to get ol outside again because on the inside it has some type of warmth fabric.It took a few days to get used to wearing this, but now I put it on almost every day under my workout gear./ quality isn't great, but would buy again.Makes me look like a box but nice quality.Dress came as pictured and is made with a thick frabric that's good for fall and winter.The ats quality is excellent.WARM CAPIt is just something to wear around the house on a hot day.The fabric has a stinky smell right out of the bag so plan on washing it right away.The flowers are nicely executed and overall it has a nice look.I love the lor and visual clarity but can't justify buying any more.The pads move around so it would've been nice if they uld be removed.Would be perfect if the material stretched.A little awkward with the hood and the zipper in the back had a tough time getting the top over my head otherwise not high quality but still a nice styleThese are more padded than we expected.The adhesive was acceptable, but the edges were quick to me off nstantly.Good feeling material.Sewn well.The intended audience for these enjoyed them, but I can't wear them mfortably on a regular basis.Just watch out for gusts of wind as dress flys up easily.inexpensiveIt is affordable and that is importantThis visor had the potential to be perfect.I would have thought that a product designed to protect your face from the sun would have the ability to stand up to the temperatures expected when sun bathing.The silver" ating is now rubbing off wherever it's touched my skin and the chain is as well.The fabric is very mfortable.The design is cute, but the fabric is thin and not high quality.Decent belt for the moneyThere just isn't enough fabric on the side for me.This thing looks oler online that it does in person.These are definitely NOT mpression.This necklace is beautiful and so versatile.This skirt looked very stylish online so I bought the purple plaid one.It looks okay in real life, very sturdy and can hold a lot of heavy stuff in it for workthis item is very mfortable i put it on right away over an underwear of urse.Furthermore, they are not very shiny, they are real diamonds but an average quality one.The silver is more stainless and each outside band is narrower.This jacket is super zy and definitely keeps you warm.I think the price it a little high for the quality.The lor is vibrant and beautiful, the material is soft as a baby's blanket.But this product is polyester, NOT a tton blend as described in the description.Love the lor and they are super soft as smoothIt still can be cute able to be worn in public if you have light under shirt available to wear with it.The texture of the socks is ideal.They are thick enough that it will keep your legs warm and the knit pattern gives it a nice accent.My problem was that the top doesnt stretch well enough, so the socks end up cutting into my thighs and I look like an overstuffed sausage as opposed to the ol effortless look I wish to had.I preferred the old ones fits much better but still a very good qualitynot a high quality piece but priced acrdinglyThe straps on the top are pretty long making it hard to adjust for better support.Was originally looking for a at ideal for winter.The material is very soft and silky, and THIN.A beautiful jacket...If you're not rail-thin, this dress is not always flattering.Looks greatGreat item for its st.Light, greta looks, I will not test the water resitance...The dungaree twill of these Chinese-made samue is of a mfortable, medium-weight tton.Wash ld, partially line-dry, iron while still damp to avoid shrinkage.The zippers do not have a nice quality feel and are not the easiest to use.To be a great bag it would need a more solid structure, better zippers and a bigger hook not made of plastic.Besides that though it's a great necklace.I was too afraid to take a risk ordering the women's cut and felt the men's cut was a safer bet, and fit.It is a lightweight fabric and I don't plan on wearing it during the winter months so it'll serve it's purpose.I'll have to have it altered.Not that I'm a pin head... hmmm...The quality isn't any higher than flea market.That flexibility doesn't impress me as a plus, it makes me worry more about the durability.Perfect for a teenagerLove the shirt....just wish I uld wear itGood fit but fabric uld be lighter and softer.You have to put together the straps and puncture the holes yourself.Very cute at.Not quite as sheer as I expected, but are great for work.I was expecting it to be more like a tton material.Was in seperate pieces when arrived but easily rennected soon problem.The fur isn't much better.It is not as elegant as I thought it would be.Also, I thought the double zipper would have two separate mpartments but they open to the same mpartment and the back one front of purse having the flap) is set back so it isn't as easy access.It is a simple purse and thought it would have a lot more organization to it.Our son loved the long tie.The underwear themselves are fine, but I thought I was ordering underwear with Mickey and tractors/farm equipment/etc as shown.Beautiful beautiful ring.This is a solid bag for the price.It's really lightweight, and folds up easily.Love the style however the edge is jagged.What a beautiful piece.the sexy bites were for my grandson who is into magic and vampires, he was a little upset that they had to mold around his teeth he is only years old.Love the quality for the price.Very light material, not very sturdy.My daugther bough this item and it was a bit short on the front but still a perfect fit.However, taking a risk and crossing my fingers, I washed it in a delicate cycle in ld water and it came out fine.Seems to be good quality.I have a curvy body so this did not workComfortable and not itchy, but one size definitely doesn't fit all.Otherwise it was a nice garment, nice material and well made.Thought this was a great looking product and was super happy.There was nothing obstructing the zipper and the dress wasn't tight at all, but the zipper would not budge on the night I needed to wear the dress.I can't wear a hat so this dress will do the job with the right necklace.but over all it ol its mfortable and lite.works for my needs, but thinner than expected.Sound was ok/ what I would expect for inexpensive earbuds.It's nice fabric and lays nicely.Awesome looking shoethe picture makes this top look a lot better.I would've given this a star if the little charm held it's design.It cuts well but leaves grooves on whatever you cut.The shirt is true to size, and the material is a good tton shirt.Though I will not wear it in my septum I am sure I will find other uses for them.So just an F.Y.I if your thinking of buying for your septum make sure you are ok with it not being able to show off the diamonds as they point straight down).The dress is very shear, might work great for a swim suit ver up.Ordered as a dress so it didn't work out great for my need, vendor refunded my money so I am happy with the outme.Band broke after less than a week of wear.Good product, but needs a but of work.This does look a little cheap, but for the price, I was expecting anything brilliantOverall, it's a decent bag with good functionality.The goldtone accessories make the bag look tacky.okay quality, okay sparklyWish I would've used it just for show" and not for purpose I don't take my navel ring out regularly so this wasn't a great selection for me.The booties were given as a baby shower gift.However, we all love the softness and they look very mfortable.For the price I think it was a good purchase, I am definitely going to wear the skirt a lot, don't know if I'll be able to pull the top off.These are all great quality however we were looking for loose fitting and they are not.The quality of this item seemed ok, about appropriate for a beach town or by the pool, which is what I wanted.The top has bra cups which is nice.There were many lose threads on the bottom but nothing you uldn't take care of.However, the tee is adorable and made of quality fabric.It was well made, and super cute.They are warm and zy on the inside very fuzzy.But nice quality.I am an older lady so all you ladies out there know how hard it is to find a suit that you feel mfy in..It's also very short waisted so it rides higher than in the photosNice productsneclace is pretty.I think this might work better later in pregnancy i'm at the end of the st trimester).the top is fine but not very sturdy, I don't expect long life from itThe mesh material is beautiful and shiny.One of the best mesh materials I have seen on items in Amazon.Overall very pretty and a good buy for the price.THIS DRESS IS SEE THROUGHfor the price the quality is not great.Didn't wash very well but was mfortable.Still, for how much I paid I feel as though I expected this.Other than that the material is high quality and the lors are right on.Cute pinky rings.Polyester is too hot for Florida.Rayon or tton would be great.The wig looked great only downside was that it sheds at lot.The recipient loved it and it came in a cute box.The clips hold very nicely though and are easy to use one-handed.Once I true it I an accessorized it, it look lovely but at a first glance an by touch it wasn't very nvincing to wear.The white jade is lovely but is g.These insoles helped in my boots.While these help, I need an insole with more padding at the ball of my foot.Overall nice earrings, but it took quite sometime before I received them.The mask arrived on time and in great ndition.Yes, it was a little warped at the top of the head but was easily fixed with a short application of my heat gun and some caressing to get it to be perfectly round.Quality is fine and brim is big....so it does it's job sun-wise.No possibility of sitting in this.its good for the price but it seams that under armor is a narrow shoe.Because my daughter has every skiphop in puppy design, so I purchased it when it was on lightening deal.I thought skiphop down graded their quality.Hopefully I can adjust it because i would like to wear it.But, I will make it work.the suit was made of quality swimsuit material and seemed to be well nstructed.Heavier material than expected but okay for winterI myself would have preferred a thicker material.With these I found the fabric to be thinner and cheaper than usual and the fabric was not soft at all.It is actually quite rough making the panties unmfortable to wear.Color and quality is great.I was looking for something to wear to work, however, these were too small and more of a casual wear.Fabric isn't very soft but great pic.Great support for my back and it did help in flattening my belly but it was very unmfortable.Great ncept but definitely lacks in quality.It's so unique and cute and I get mpliments on it everywhere I go.The edges for the other pieces me up as well, as if they aren't adhered properly.Some of them are too detailized so they won't pick up on stamp.Nice in many ways but didn't like not having a zippered closure over credit cards.The necklace took a long time to arrive and had a little glue on the edge.For such a low price, this can't be perfect, but it is cuteSo pretty much I would be able to wear it at a friend's pool or an adults-only Hotel.It's see through without being wet when wet it's absolutely see it throughBecause of the narrow inside lining, it needs to be pinned in several spots to secure it.It would be a great permanence addition to a sweater.The face is actually nicer looking.look good on grandfather not my husband he The fabric is not as soft as other fishnet stockings I've purchased.The material is okay.Otherwise very attractive.Could be made better.The fabric is not great but it looks good.Fair to good quality in workmanship.Cute mfy but maternity clothing- you can't tell.If not for the belt cracking i would have given this a five star review.Looks prettier in the picture than in person.The only attractive thing about it, is the bow and key chain ornamentation on the front.Honestly, I'm not in love, but it was inexpensive, and it'll do the job.I ended up cutting off the loops and tied the tip of the wing to a hair elastic and wore the elastic around my wrist, which actually made it easier to use since I had my hands mpletely free.Great ProductI do love this necklace.It's way more gold than it looks in the picture, which was disappointing at first but I've found it mpliments almost any outfit and finally I have something to go with the few pairs of gold earrings I own.They stay in place, even while sleeping, but I wouldn't wear them in a pool or the ocean.Good for office wear.Super mfortable, love deftones, has a unique design on it, nice hoodie to layer with.Otherwise, good material and does the job of holding in and enuraging my abs to sweat more.The lace design is very cute.More of a causal dress than work attireA bit see-through, but fits nice, and it's mfy.not made for curvy girls, but I made it work Crystals were perfectly attached and frame was smooth.Too many seamsThe shirt itself is not the softest, but it is very mfortable and fits as expected.Tt is not baby doll cut, which was perfect for me, but it is definitely still cut for women.The silk screening is not quite thick enough, as there is a bit of bleeding of the navy blue through the white silk-screening.Love material just wish it was bigger.Fabric is thick and has a nice drape.I don't find the fit very mfortable, but I planned to wear this to an event so will keep it and hope the zipper doesn't break.I've had to have altered-Tired of black, so this is a nice alternative.Good fabric, ordered large medium not available it is some what large.Good quality socks.It's a very pretty necklace, but they need to update the photos.However, the stones are a bright teal, and the metal is a bright, shiny, tacky fake gold.A uple of the stones had fallen off, but were still in the package, so easy fix with some hot glue.the product is very beautiful and looks exactly like the photoit is very very well made and affordable.too heavy as a necklacenot quality I expected for the price paid.Cute little outfit and good quality.It's wasn't the right infinity necklace, the other one is still nice thoBeautiful embroidery and nice material.Not perfect quality but it fits well.its beautifulI was not happy with fabric texture which is why I returned.Nice shirt, I line animal shirts, but this.Seems like it is good quality but the ring stone is a lot huger than I expected and not as pretty as I was expecting either.not the best quality material, but it's mfortable and looks cuteBut the fabric was very soft and mfortable on my skin.They are nice overall.This is good quality but I ordered it in - months when I got it it would fit a month oldREALLY BIG pearlsi would want even warmer socks.Very cute top, nothing wrong with it however I wish that it was longer or a bit more lose.I love the lace and quality is nice, just doesn't fit well unfortunately (This was too tight for my taste, however it is a nice dress.I have a pair of tan ones that definitely are leather, and it says* these are too, but there's no give to themI love the look, so I'm keeping them, but I'm disappointed that they aren't as mfortable as my other pair.The chain is much thicker than pictured, it's not as delicate as the picture, so it doesn't look very feminine.Nice and soft, but mine isn't as pretty as the picture.For the price it's a pretty ring.It isn't mpletely squared edges but it is not a mfort band.Didn't love this blouse.The fabric reminds me of lack of a better example a doll dress, you know....cheap rayon.I did not find the bracelet that mfortable; maybe flex or a little curve to the edge closest to the skin might help.Very nice and stylish back, however, the material was a little too hard for me.I actually love the cross the quality is great.These are mfortable and I like how thin they are without being sheer.It's also scratchy.After a uple of washings---ld water, low heat, the shape is not holding up as well as I thought it should for the price.They were not mfortable to wear at all.With that said, they do seem like very durable goggle that won't break easily so they would be perfect for kidsQuality uld have been better.It feels very thin and needed to be ironed when I washed it.The other scarf I bought for albeit smaller in size feels thicker and did not need ironing.It is beautiful and warm.Not so warm for the severe winters, but can handle the ld very well.So, if you are new to snow like me and intend to play with it, it is better looking for another option.With this material being what it is, it shows every single dimple" you may have.difficult to get on and tighten but once on felt goodNot as gorgeous as it looks in the pictureDid shrink just a bit after washing in ld and drying with medium heat.The bag is great for my needs.I use this for work and it is great with all the different mpartments.I can separate things and still find everything.I know the bag was on the cheaper side but months of use is way less time than I was expecting.This ring is absolutely gorgeous and has the perfect size hearts, so it's not overbearing on your finger, but after days of wearing it, the black plated band is now a pper band.It's great quality.The shoes are very mfortable.The blouse is very stylish and lovely.The quality is good and looks very niceIn general it's beautiful.Very pretty though for the price.Wears OK, but I won't be buying any more.It's made well.Material is good mparable to basketball shorts.If you have a muffin top...STOPYou will not look good in it.Your Abs will definitely be noticeable because of the low rise pattern.They are mfortable and stretch with movement.Love the texture and quality.Love the material thoughBuilt-in cups are a necessary addition to this suit.Cute belts, but in a one size fits all".Purchased these a while ago, and honestly my opinion on them is, so and so.The hat quality and look are great.So beautiful but had to alter and is mpletely see through... Not sure what to wear it for other than a beach wedding...But is so beautifulFits well and is mfortable but fabric doesn't breathe during exercise, got very unmfortable and felt restrictedIt looks cheaply made but I guess you get what you pay for / -; Other than that it looks goodBut its to warm, I get hot and sweaty after wearing it a little bit.REALLY NICE FABRIC.This dress had potential.Love the bracelet but lost it the first time wore it because it would not stay fastened.Quality is great, and I would've loved to use it, but it's too small for me.First time I've ever experienced that with clothing.I love how soft and silky it is though, so I'm happy to keep it and may perhaps get one moreit is much more gold and honestly not nearly as cute in personLove the ncept, but just after one wash the black is fading.I do not feel it will last long.I thought the tank was a bit pricey for the quality.Enough Springs for a lifetimeThere are better ones and a cheaper price.If it didn't, the shirt would be perfectThe material isn't sewn together very well.It's ol because it's very thin so be careful where you where this.Overall the ring is really pretty.A shame as it looks good on.But if you order right it would be very beautiful on.Okay quality.The ring is beautiful, just non-adjustable.I bought this one as a backup to more expensive milano extrawig grip.The material is nice and the llar lays well but it is way too long in the back for me.I bought this top a long time ago and I still wear it.Looks much better in the photo.Comfy.I like this shirt it is cute and the quality is nice.You can't see through it, but the material just shows every crease and crevice.Other than that, I ordered silver and received gold, and the metallic accents are actually plastic, but I think they're well nstructed and will hold up over time.A really lovely product.But the top is cute, just be aware of the tan line you'll getI will wash by hand and hang dry to extend its life.I'm on the heavier side right now, and I feel very mfy in it.This vers the thick parts of my body and flatters the better parts.Great lor assortment, but nearly half don't work...they either break after a uple of days use, the balls won't stay on or just don't screw on at allWhile it's a pretty scarf, it's not exactly what I was expecting.It was above my C-section scar but not enough to be mfortable swimming in it.While its gorgeous, it is see-through, so you have to wear a slip, have it lined or use it as a beach ver-up instead of a sun dress.But it is still gorgeous so I'll have to just have it altered.This bathing suit is absolutely beautiful in person and is very mfortable.This was a great dress for the occasion I needed it for.Also there's a seam down the back in addition to seams on both sides which makes it less flowy.I like the style and cut but the fabric is not soft.Material is soft, but would not have bought it if I knew the length was this short.the glitter just falls too much...I had glitter all over the bathroom floor and carNice earnings but for adults or maybe for older girlsLove the buckle tho,glad I had a different belt too put it onThe fabric uld be softer.its a fun pair of underwear.It's exactly as pictured.Otherwise the top is very nice.Material is of good quality.All in all the quality of the bag is classic Dooney.Very nice material, we'll nstructed.The material was very thin you'll definitely need a cami or undershirt).It is not nstructed well at all.Glasses fit very well.Lenses are a bit loose in the frames but the glasses are overall in great ndition.This is not too distracting though and should not be a deal breaker.I liked them, but they are a short wear.The dress is ok, not too crazy about the material, but I kept it as it is mfortable.The hat is awesome quality just very big for my toddlerSuper cute, not great for working out, kept falling down, better for lounging.Otherwise it's great.not very high qualityI loved the fit and quality tton fab.I was very pleased with the length, until the first washing.washed in ld water and dried in moderate heat I lost about " on the length.Especially in the sun they give off a wonderful shine.Had some creases in it that I uldn't ever get to smooth out.This garment was everything that I thought it would be upon purchasing it.The quality and warm factors were off the charts which were great for the ld winter nights.We loved the print, and the fit was right, but my daughter wishes the material was a bit thicker/fluffier...Charm doesn't lock together.-it's not very flattering to the figure I work out for ( but I'll still wear it for casual things.They make a good gift for your favorite lush friend.It wrinkles and will need ironing after washing.Also this suit has no tummy ntrol but it does feel mfy around the legs and back.Quality is okIt's light weight denim material and looks nice.The first time the hat was surprisingly good quality.Unfortunately the send hat was a totally different brand and not near as nice quality wise.The embroidery work is the same and it is excellent on both hats.It's a nice piece but I wish opening of the ends of the chain gold cups are up side down.It would look a lot better.Now I hope I can find some kind of filling to fill in the holes.the delivery was delay but love my chainVery good product, but is beatiful.Decent material, from previous ratings I expected it to be cheaply made, but was pleasantly surprised that it was well made.Otherwise, I am happy with the product.The price was even greatFor very durableI loved the way it fit, but I feel bad that it hasn't held up for more than swims and washes.The shirt mes as shown, nice quality.I attached a pic of the off center seem, hopefully you can see it. out of were great even if they weren't quite the same as in the picture.I prefer thicker materials that keep their shape better.I loved them until the point and than I was upset that i bought the product.Excellent customer support.Material was lighter than expected.The magnet is not very strong and it can only hold a few dollarsLoved the dress but the zipper wouldn't zip all the way up.Not great quality, but my daughter loves the picturesPROS: It's definitely better quality and bigger than what I was expecting, especially for the price.Would have liked them better if the lace was softer.It doesn't look like a well made shirt.I like the fabric it is machine washable delicate)It's cute, but I doubt it will last long.Super cute, but for a newborn For the price this is a great hat to keep the sun off your face.Please be aware that this dress is very sheer.Didnt last long before they broke.I wish that the material was better, because it's form fitting and absolutely stunning.I wasn't even doing anything strenuous with the ring.Other than that, the dress is great.it is not mfortable.I have not wore it out yet, because it is not fitting mfortably.It looks nice and has soft leather.It was too flexibleFor the price its ok dont expect this to look good or last too muchAlso a little scratchy.Nice buckle thoughNot very warm, mfortable, but not worth buying a nd pair.This is not made for people with curves, but for the price I still wore the top and bought a different pair of bottoms for it.These are as described, but are not the highest grade titanium.However, It stretches out really easily, so it still works for me.OK as just a nightgownThis bracelets are nice.Stylish.Haven't worn them yet, but the material is nice.It takes a long time and is expensive.The quality and fit are ok.Wish it was put together a little better and I would be willing to pay a higher price.So many pockets, very functional, and very cute looking tooGreat productAnyway, decent price and good item but not happy with how it looks on me personally.The pant set fit as expected and the material is mfortable, my only mplaint is the lining of the jacket shed on my shirt immediately, and after washing the pants, the lining began shedding as well.As is clearly seen, they are made of canvas material.This is cute but fit alittle tight because it's mostly rayon versus tton so not very forgiving.He picked this mask based on the lower price.It wasn't the highest quality but it made him happy.He has it hanging on his bedroom wall.It might not be one of the higher quality, more expensive masks but it still is pretty nice for the price.good item for the price, not terrific quality but who really cares for a carry bagMIGHT HAVE WORKED BETTER IF IT CAME IN DIFFERENT COLORS THEN SHE WOULDN'T HAVE MIND IT AND A BIT LONGER, SO IT GAVE HER ROOM TO PUT HER HAT ONDidnt like the fabric too silky for meI bought this to wear underneath a body hugging cktail dress, the material of the dress was a little bit thick but not % spandex.Doesn't make my body look good at all (I LOVE LOVE LOVE the support these sandals give.They also look quite nice.Payless has WAY better VelcroBut love it otherwiseCute idea but the material is super thin and not very flattering.I like the partial see through quality of these underwear.Everything about this hoodie is great EXCEPT its LONG.One piece,decent leather.A little softer than I prefer but good buy for the money.The only thing I like was the firmness from the wait part it really pulls you in and gives you a good waist line )Not appropriate for the use I had in mind, but lovely all the sameNot very warm.I use them in snow to clean driveway and my hands were not warmIt's REALLY boxy.The fabric is nice, a little more sheer than I would've liked, but still soft and a beautiful lor.And it overall does look well made, no loose threads in mine or anything.Both the Time Turner" and the Deathly Hallow" pendant are cute.It's fine, but not a winter at.Would make a nice autumn at.I have the Match Men's pea at which is thicker and much better for winter.Ultimately, not a bad at, certainly not for the money, but it is A) NOT a winter at, just a fashionable autumn at and B) you need to take some nsiderations as to sizing and utility before you purchase.Beautiful but heavyIt's cute, it will work for what I need it for so I'm happy with my purchase.The fabric is really nice, but if nditions are just right the seam in the pouch' area will land right on your bell-end.Good material but very tiny and revealing more than vering..Overall these are very cute, stylish glasses, and you honestly can't beat the priceI wish it wasn't a fuzzy material but this was the only dress I uld find to transform into Magenta and overall I am very satisfied.Received necklace early which was a nice surprise.So if you're looking for a nice sturdy skull that is a good size then I would remmend this but if you're looking for a nice chain I would look somewhere else.Glitter everywhere.Great top, different for sure, but buyer beware of the glitter.This dress is very see-through.Cute though, and very soft on the inside.Nice quality regardlessDoesn't look too appealing.It was super cute but the buttons were plastic and didn't stay together very well.fine but too thick to be realistic nose ringOtherwise it is beautiful.The stone isn't put into the stainless steel housing evenly so its lopsided see photo).This is a substantial t-shirt like knit fabric that does not have an easy flow, but rather is a bit stiffer.This is cute I did have bunching at the stomach area for my shape it wasn't as flattering as other bathing suits so I decided to wear it with shorts.Decent quality for the price.Love the bag itself but the handles won't stay buckled.Neck is open and has a lot of room inside, doesn't hug the body.It has very slight material, but it is a mfortable warm weather sleep top.These are beautiful.The wallet is great and the leather is decent, my only problem is that the brown loring is starting to wear off after only months and showing black marks.For a wallet I don't feel this is acceptable since this is something I should be able to expect to have it last a longer time than months before it shows wear.I had a Fossil wallet that this is replacing that is still in perfect ndition after years but is too bulky for my current needs.Pretty, but the clasp doesn't work quite right.It's pretty and mfortable but for me personally I have to safety pin the top to keep it closed.The material got a lot of pulls in it after just an uple of hours of use at a water park.The bottom part was loose fitting but it was mfy.Nicely made, it's big and very sparkly.So if you looking for something to stand out, this it's just perfect.The mouse pad looks amazingThe product arrived quickly, the product looks good.It doesn't work as well with slacks as it does with jeans.I loved it and wished it was thicker in the back.I like these leggings they are mfortable, soft and easy to pull on and off.It's beautiful but a little flimsy but for the price it's good.The material is different than materials used in other vintage dresses I have purchased.It stretches nicely over my package and feels very mfortable.For the price it's okay and mfortable.The outfit is cute, especially for the price.Couldn't alter with all the beads so had to sew in pads-not ideal.Typically a /, depending on material.Seems like it's made well overall.Overall it was worth the money and it is usable but not what I thought it would be.Not as sturdy as I'd like to see, but holding up well otherwise.Nice wristletHowever the fleece lining is of good quality and keeps me warm zyInexpensive, and you get what you pay for.Other than that, fine shirt.So now I'm looking for a way to repair it to preserve the fun nature of what these were supposed to be otw they are just simple blue and red trunks)Material is a very lightweight sweatshirt material, not exactly French terry, but not a heavy sweatshirt fleece, actually I prefer it to a regular sweatshirt more versatile.Other than that, the other necklaces were in great shape.These are cute styles and of a fairly decent quality.The silver added a little bulk and texture so they sat a little better on my fingers.The clearat was to make sure they do not turn my fingers green.The v neck portion is flattering.Not my kind of style for a sweater.It's very warm thoughIts simple.Now i can only where with long shirts.I liked the material The thickness and quality felt great, but I wound up giving it to my year old, instead of the year old it was bought for, due to the smaller sizing.So i sewed up the little tears around my sleeves.It doesn't lay flat but it's pretty..The lights are vibrant and the shoes overall are mfortable but they did stop charging the send time we plugged them in so it has defeated the purpose of the shoes.Beautiful scarf but I did not get an infinityIt is not one large loop but rather a flat piece of material like traditional scarves.I love this pattern and the material is so soft...This bracelet also only adjusts on one side rather than both, so one of those loose strings is purely aesthetic.The quality of the material was not what I expected.Not as plush as photo and difficult to keep on; needs some kind of fastener in the front.The top gaps open in the front and lace on the jacket is not trimmed very well.The lor is perfect buy the quality is not goodSo it is not well made.The actual wolf emblem looks ol and even the leather bracelet part...so my daughter and I are hoping to purchase some better clasps or parts to fix it with.Not very good quality linen.Beautiful suitThis dress looks great.top needs a liner and more verage.I like the fabric and it is very mfortable.Still, the style looked so great--that sweet spot between man-tailored and feminine--that I finally ordered it.A good camisole would have made it decent for the general public.*The material felt silky-nice.*For the price, though the shirt clearly wasn't fine tailored, the cut looked just as shown.Material is very slinkyOverall good quality product.The material has a silky feeling and is fun to wear.The silk is nice and the pattern is as advertised but you really have to be petite to fit into it.The piercings aren't diverse enough with tongue rings being the main piercing in the kitQuality and design are great; size is way off.its nice but when i sit the chain popsThe product is very nice quality, but I think it works better from smaller cup sizes.Fabric a little cheap but looks niceI have to remember, you got what you pay for... this was not expensive )It was good for the price, but the chain oxidized very fast.The price was very good in mparison to all the others for sale ) and the material seemed well made, the lor was very bright and looked good.I love this shirt it is thin silky material, but I ordered an XL and it still does not fit me.The dress was really cute, but it was a little too low-cut for my taste.This jewelry is beautiful and it was purchased for a birthday gift.Delivery service was excellent.fabric llected a lot of lint.it is very mfortable but..... wouldn't buy againIt looks like pale peach to me.Otherwise, loved them.They are mfortable and look good.Great charm, lovely and just as I expected.Dress is not that well made.It's great quality and light weight style is great.The material and patterns were nice.It would look nice on you if you look like the lady in the picture.A mfortable,adjustable chain, but you have to keep an eye on it since the cross can pass through the infinity symbol.Otherwise I loved the shirt.Received on time and looks good.Love this bag, I bought it as a trendy piece to wear casually.Not certain if the strap closure is strong enough to sustain an active day at the pool.And for the price you get what you pay for as far as quality... don't think for a sec that you want to swim around in this thing... pop goes the....Great price, uldn't quite tell lor from picture.Its a nice dark tan, and kind of glossy.They seemed well made and even came with extra heal taps if replacement was needed.It's not as nice and clear as it shows in the picture attached.It's mfortable material and fits decently.fair price for some pretty good sunglassesReasonable for the price, it came in an elegant jewelry box.Great value for someone like me who wanted diamond earrings for less.Light and silky.They are very baggy and do not look good.They are very mfortable and I like the way they look, but when the sun hits me as I drive they don't protect me.The outfit was great.The fabrics are great but the seams on this style were a bit off".All of their products seem to be a good value for the quality you get.i had a feeling as soon as i felt the fabric for some reason.Nice lor and material.Wish the bottoms fit..the print is so cute and material is nicer than I expectedIt's stretchy and light but not breathable and doesn't look flow-y like it does in the picture.Looks great turns skin green and plating falls off in days.Ring does not have as much detail to it as the picture shows.The ring I received is mpletely smooth.I have decided to go ahead and give it to her, but would have preferred to receive the item I thought I was buying.However I will say the were of good quality and just for the fun factor my wife and I both wished they would have worked out.Beautiful dress but not for a short person.It's so well made and has great storage.The product looks great it just doesn't fitIf you have a tush, not so great on the verage slops down.The outfit is ok in quality.it did me with a lot of verity but now everything in the picture.Bought this for my mom but it wasn't gentle on the hip area.These sunglasses are really cute but they are not mfortable to wear.The lor is a little loud for my taste.Washes up well and is warm.Great quality though.My wife bought this item; from what I heard, it's a bit too tight and it seems to be more cumbersome than mfortable...the ties felt a little cheap; however, that isn't the reason for three stars the ties do their job).Stones were very shiny and beautiful... Metal uld have been better...:( Oh well super glue shall fix it.I sewed it myself and this dress is beautiful.Applying a at of clear nail polish to the back of the galaxy piece helps protect against that.Great for the pricePrice reflects the quality.It presents itself as a real leather bag.The brass tone pieces look okay for them to be lored plastic.Hopefully in spring when it warms up, we can really see how these things wear.It is pretty, but the quality is not great.Super cute but more of a midi ring.The shoes were good and looked exactly as they did in the pictures.Gifted it to my Granddaughter and she loved it.This is a beautiful dress.The dress I received has a low soped back.As bright as it is on the screen but HUGEToo bad bc lor and material is nice for priceI didn't check the other reviews very well so I didn't realize how thin and see through the material was.I was in early rd trimester of pregnancy when I wanted to wear this and it fit over my belly with no problem and no further impact on its see through issue, luckily.My fiance, now husband, and I decided kind of last minute that we didn't want to wait for a more perfect" time to tie the knot.Very cute and mfortable gloves.I fashioned an adjustable rd from some brown leather shoelaces.I especially like the spikes used for the cross.If you're looking for a choker, then this will work just fine.It is very thin so it's perfect for spring and possibly a ol summer day.If I hadn't accidentally thrown away the packaging I would be returning this since I am not sure I will wear it.These are okay .. but they are not soft.GREAT price ..The quality is not awesome but for the price they work great.Pretty ring, girlfriend loved it but a few weeks after receiving it one of the stones fell out.Over all you know it's not a high quality ring but for everyday wear it is pretty.High low, which isn't my favorite.Plus the shirt is sheer.Was nice on the picture look so big thanksIt flares and puffs beautifully.Very casual relaxing wear.The quality suggests that this will be a quick rotation and will not hold up for many wears, but I think for the price and style this is good value.wasn't to impressed with this when it arrived but it wasn't expensiveA little too dark but excellent qualityIt looks good at a glance, and if you don't intend to wear it often then it may work well for you, but despite being made with decent material and an aesthetic design there is a major lack of craftsmanship here.The fabric is of medium weight, suitable if you don't run or jump, just make sure to wear a sporran so the wind doesn't flip your kilt./ design, / craftsmanshipAll that being said, it's ol even with the / sleeves mfortable and perfect for what I bought it for...lounging and light yard/garden work.Nice product.The softness of these shirts is amazing, so mfortable.I wear at night so the details do not show so much, but it's very cute.The fabric is soft and the lors are beautiful.Over all I was very disappointed with the quality, but after having it fixed it fit great and was a hitThe jewels are very pretty and reflect light in a non-annoying way.The pearls are also a very nice touch.I bought this for my daughter, and she loves that she can see through it while keeping dry.Love the idea, but there has got to be a way to keep the plastic from sticking to itself we live in an arid climate, so humidity is not the cause).It's good for ld weather, but not too much for snow for an active child.It will keep them warm and it looks good, but it's not water proof, and they get wet.Great material and good quality but unfortunately didn't fit like I thought.I wanted a longer necklace to wear with tee shirt dresses.I only wish they had a little thicker padding in the sole of them.love the material.I am hoping it will loosen up, but as it is right now, it's unwearable.Fangs look good but did not me with the molding mpoundRUNS BIG...Decent quality for what I expected- I guess, still not sure if it's worth price though.I love the design on the shirt and the silky feel, but it's way too easily snagged.Still worth the buy just not for an everyday wear.So, this is much lager than I was expecting.It's very lovely, though.I am thinking I'll keep it and use it on ld nights at the beach.This is a super cute top, good quality for the price.Cute, but not exactly what I was expecting.The nstruction is nice, but the fabric is like workout fabric- sort of silky, not tton-esque at all.The top isn't supportive at all, which will be fine for someone who doesn't need it.Nice material but it runs large.Not sure I'll buy any more of the lors, but I'm sure this one will get heavy rotation during these hot summer months.Very flexible; makes them feel a little cheap, but they work just fine.They are too heavy to work well in holding your tie in place.I have over ties and I have many claps.They should have a more rugged spring to hold them or they should be lighter.If you have sensitive skin it won't feel nice.My fault for not reading more closely.The material is a little sweaty feeling for me but I'm glad it's a nursing shirt.Good price, a lot loss hairs, still not able to wear it until hair stop falling?Good quality, but these are kid sizes.But the material seemed fine, I would have kept them if they fit.While this top is beautiful and seems well made.Products were great, but there's some obvious issues, with stones you have to realize that both plugs won't be identical.As for other buyers, be careful the product is great but the sizing is sometimes way off and you may need to return.it was good quality and a pretty lor and fit well for plus size but was really shortJust personal preference.And, they're mirrored with UV so, theres a lot of protection there.Its good that they're adjustable, because they were pinching the crap out of my noseThe belt is mfortable, looks and feels good, but after several weeks of use it is already showing signs of wear and tear.And not in the good way a full grain leather belt should.Can't how up to the pressure of multiple airline travels.they are almost see thru, mfy but will be wearing with very long ver up.These pants were extremely mfortable and as a tall woman they were actually long enough for me which I loved.But other than that I loved the design, look, and feel of the bracelet.It's a nice dress, material seems durable and definitely to be washed by hand.Was so hoping these would work out and be mfortable Very pretty top and well made overall.It has a nice silky texture, is the right length, attractive buttons, bow as pictured, good stitching and looks expensive.I love every items quality, but the flower girl basket is tiny....The chain itself is fine for an inexpensive chain no one would ever mistake it for gold).The tee was very cute and well made.Otherwise the stone was in good ndition and so was the band, no scratches and it is shiny and seems relatively well made.If you are looking for a large stone solitaire, this would make a great piece of cktail jewelry or something similar.I have owned wigwam socks for years and never had any issues.These socks feel great, don't retain odors, stay in place, dry quickly and are extremely durable.It feels nice looks good was worth it once I got it tailored.The lettering and images were a little fuzzy, which was really the only issue I had with this shirt, but the husband loved it.Very dainty and beautiful.Although the letter is thin it does allow the hand to breathe without sweating profuselyI loved this topReally short but nice fabric.She loves the mermaid tail and has to wear over swim bottoms that don't match.While very mfortable, these are not built to last.Dress looks just like the picture and the quality is great.It does take a while to get here from China but the Quality was good.They look better on line.They are in my suitcase, on the bathroom floor, every where the shirt has been it has left a little trail of silver sparkle.Still evident and easy to see even when not in personal space.cute top, but not so great quality.Beautiful flower design, exactly as pictured.The material a little irritating, but better with a few washes.The material is nice and sturdy.This fits pretty well and looks nice, but the quality is as you would expect from a cheaper knock-off.It is nice and warm though.nice quality, prompt delivery, sizes run bigThis clingy dress accentuates it.Quality is nice.The material is not as nice as it looks in the picture.These are awesome sock patterns, I admit.For the price though, they're great.Great straw hat, but as all straw hats go, durability is mplete s***.Beautiful material.Material is average for the price.Wrinkles easy, but a steamer or iron fixes that issue.Was told it had the same lining in sleeves and it Does Not.They do mmunicate well and the dress is beautiful, just buy well in advance so if you have to have it altered.nothing fancy, but what can you expect for such price?Simple and cheap but keep flawless time..for childrenThe straps didn't adjust tight enough for my liking, either.Very supportive, but hard to zip upI do think that its going to fit once I lose some pounds I'll send pictures ones I try it again liked the fabric its thin and perfect for summer.The fabric is a bit thin, but for the price they are ok.The ver is a tad too soft, I wish they provided some kind of lining.Nice material, good for the price, just is mm narrower than it shoul be, so you get a little gap and movement where it attaches to the watch.I'm sad about this because it would otherwise have perfect starspurchased for child, so I can't speak to the mfort or arch support really.cute shoeIt's beautiful but the panties aren't what I expected.The bra gives really nice lift and support.These were BEAUTIFUL.The roses broke off after days of wearing them and thays with very gentle and light use.For the price it's pretty good.Functionally, this little purse is fine.I love the shirt itself.Material not as expected but soable.When I cleaned the jade' ones some of the green washes off.I'm sure a stones lor doesn't wash off like that.I still use it to this day and still looks fabulous.The material feels very nice; it is sleek and soft.The pattern is vibrant and eye appealing.It is not soft at all.I think this would look a lot better on someone who is fuller chested.The cut is nice and the neck line is flattering.It is very mfortable.they are so beautifulBeautifulMy absolute favorite piece of body jewelry.Really cute, not the best quality, but okay.So as far as looks go, they are great.Other than the SOFT metal that the post is made of and the fact that the earring backs provided don't fit, I really like these earrings.I love my Ann Taylor pair in gold, so was happy to find this pair in silver.Cute and well made.This blouse is what one would expect for the price.The print is a bit fuzzy ie, low quality) and the fabric is fair quality.But it is very inexpensive and a cheap way to add the season's trendy florals to my wardrobe without a big investment.So if you are looking for high quality, this is not it, but if you want a mfortable springy blouse for low st, it fits the bill.They really do not stay on as a cuff and I had to wear them as basic earring so they lost a little bit of the appeal.But overall absolutely fabulousIt was a straight line dress.. but it was very beautiful.They feel like spandex material.Looks different from picture.Design is greatHeavy material that doesn't breathe at allThe heart point is sharp.It didn't shrink and it is nice and warm.It's not the unique piece I was hoping for.Nice shirt for the price.Quality of fabric is not what I would purchase in person.They are warm.Seem well made otherwise.But a good product otherwise.I am not large in the chest but I think for more well endowed women this suit might be unmfortable.I loved the idea of these, but the zippers barely worked.The price was low though so I wasn't expecting much different.Nice for the price, but they fall down.The product looked like it was made well, and the gems looked secure, which has always been a ncern of mine.it's alright, it's an okay skirt but it isn't the skirt from the picture.Although, it is very long and I will have to wear VERY high heels or get it altered.I would be careful if washing in a washer because of the material and if it shrinks anymore it will be hard for you to wearA beautiful dress.Quality fabric.Hoping they don't break when I wear them on the beach.Overall with a little alteration it will do for my occasion.Would be better if the lightning bolt and the metal right next to it matched more closely.The sewing quality is not the best.It's not great quality.I just wish I were made with better material to make a better product.They're really very soft and mfy, but a little on the small size.The price of this sweater was relatively inexpensive so I am not surprised about the thickness.mfortable material, fit well,But for it was worth the minutes to took to revamp it because it is so very cuteLove the heavy material and structure.Works great if you're layering.The sweater is very softThe fabric is a bit sheer, so I will wear to cami under it.opal is not at all like an opal the rest were niceIts a good quality but it is way to big in the top mpared to the bottom.Material is not that great.Loved it at first-- but has already broken.Its well made.I think it's a different material but overall niceIt's pretty and the material is ok.This at is not warm.The fabric is very hot, but overall it is okay.These are fine, but not exactly high quality.This is a beautiful dress, but from the pictures you can't really tell that it is mpletely see-thru, with little tiny bra cups.I had to have the bodice lined in order for her to wear it.They are pretty and delicate, but subdued.This cross pendant is absolutely beautiful but it's HUGEAlthough the upper half seems to be longer than the lower half, and the shorts seem a little too short I'm still fine with it and wear it in the pool.These are adorable and well made.These leg warmers are mfy and soft.Shirt material is soft and accurately picturedo.Have not yet had an opportunity to use it so uncertain how well it fits under the seats or holds up over travelling.The good points are that it is a lovely skirt, and is elegant.Having said all this, I would buy it again because I love the way the material feels and flows.Dry clean remmended.The non-elephant rings are not adjustable, and they seem to be of better quality.One was from a different set of rings that I bought months ago, and have worn every day since.Not very strong.For the price and the style/material, I would buy again.I wanted to use it as a vacation dress but now will use it as a beach ver up.Maybe even a night robe.not as cute in personpretty goodIts a soft feeling jacket.The jacket was in a plastic bag and was light as a bird well like a crow, maaaybe?Just be careful because it feels like it will rip easily easier than the thick and heavy leather jackets).Not a huge fan of the mesh.the silver sequins should have been on the back of dressCute socks for a giftWas expecting better quality fabric.A uple of the crystals stick out to make a pointy edge.Pretty dress, but very see-throughWish the leather was of higher quality.The shirt is beautifulI imagine I will lose this pin, but for now it is beautiful to look at.It's still beautiful so I'll keep it.I MADE IT WORKVery light and breathable.Other than that, fantastic for warmer weather and travel.Fabric is stretchyGood but didn't me on the dated requirementsSo I'm keeping it but wish the zipper were better quality.The quality is okay for a shirt to be worn on several occasions.The shirt has a firm starch llar with a built-in flexible llar stay, and mes with cheap plastic removable buttons.There are many loose threads and the nstruction is not the best of quality and stitching, but overall still wearable.Great for pajama pants.was cute but uldn't wearThe fabric is a little light weight but not real see-through.Great for the first month I had them, but after that I had worn them out.Great ugly Christmas sweaterLooks great, very light weight and all one piece.Rest and ice are the only thing that helps.Nice top bottom is very thin material.If this had been lightweight tton, i would give it stars but even though there are open spaces.the acrylic yard is much too warm for spring/summer days.Doesn't stay layered out as shown in the picture.Are Beautiful earringsAbsolutely stunningBut one of the roses came off before night was over.... May purchase again... they were very very prettyThe fabric was of good quality though.Warm, looks good but the quality isn't there.beautiful yellow necklace.These shirts are good quality and all, but MUCH lighter than I expected.Nice quality runs a little smallThese are nice, thick pants.It's a stranger design than I was expecting.It buttons very low so it looks great with a shirt and tie.Athletic build.The product is the same as the picture, excellent nditions, even tho there were problems and my product almost get lost, but it's okayIt was a great looking jacket, made well, and well sewn.I bought this purse intending to mbine my diaper bag my purse for an upming vacation but I'm positive it wouldn't handle the weight.Didn't wind all types of watches.Cushion moves while winding.Looks great, itchy fabric though.I like the design and the feel, seems good quality, however it's too big for the Surface I bought it for.great product.They are beautiful but I'm not sure I'll wear them too often because now I'll be very aware of problem and keep checking to see if they need adjusting.But for high intensity workouts, they just aren't cutting the mustard.The fabric was not what I expected.... its too flowy and shiny.But it's great still have and wear every Now and then .Love this but not made very well, seams are ming apart.....I liked that the ring is very sturdy and the right size I was looking for, but it is very hard to use.This cute peekaboo baby doll is very sexy and elegant.The fabric is sheer and soft and looks very good on my wife.This is a pretty decent set for the price.The only mplaints we have are the Stitching is not good at all.Its not our favorite piece, but for the price and with a few adjustments made at home it will be one we will enjoy for as long as it holds up.The material is not good Otherwise the fabric and lor are both nice and I may be able to wear with a cami or sundress once the weather warms up.The XL i then order fit my L frame perfectly and was of great quality.Will be great to wear to an upming party.This was nice quality, but I had to return it as it was skin tight.Love the material though, very soft.It's beautiful BUT the top ball doesn't fasten tight enough and lost it in the shower within a week Made in China, well priced, and you get what you pay for.One they are a little see throughNice ncept but the material was thin.The design is awesome just a bit long) but the fabric is a slick heavy polyester.The gown doesn't flow or feel right.It would be so much better if it were made of a soft tton.I doubt if many USA women would choose this fabric.In my opinion, if the mpany would make this design with a better quality fabric, they uld sell this item at a higher price and have many more satisfied customers.I went out and bought a different bottom because I didn't think it vered what needed vered.It was a little arse and not a soft tulle that i expected.The dress looks pretty cheap but if you are wearing for one day... it would be fine.Other than that, they are quite cute.They aren't the best quality, I won't wear them much for daily use, especially under jeans.They are really more for bedroom attire, which is fine because they are cute, playful, and definitely show off your assets" beautifully.But cute swim suite.Material is too thin but it will serve its purpose as a verup.One of the charms broke off however the bracelet is still in great nditionThe fabric is not a good quality but it's ok I guessMaterial not very soft.I loved this waist trainer and wore it all the time for months.This dress was VERY cute.The bottom has layers BUT the top has only layer which makes it sheer, I will need to put something under the dress which I hate to do, it will not match the nice details the dress already has.Ethel look nice but two of the black stones were unstick when I received themBut I do feel the price was fair.They are good material but really longLooked good with flats.These look good but I wonder about the nstruction.But it is beautifully made.Doesn't get very warmI'm mths pregnant was looking for mfy capri's to wear.I have a very picky granddaughter, when she found out that it was not a real Ivory Ella, she told me the only reason she wanted it was because a portion of the price is for endangered elephants.Lovely Skirt.Soft fabric.The bust pads were bright white so you can totally see the bust pads through the see through topNot a very high quality product, or the stitching isn't, at least.I just received my necklaces but what made me very disappointed is that when I opened the infinity sign necklace it did not say directioner ( it was just plain but for the paper airplane I LOVE ITThe derative ball is cute.Clunky.We're picky about work clothing and have been using Carhartt for years.Nice leather strap rather than rubber/plastic.They serve the purpose of outdoor sunglass readers if your expectations are low for quality and high for it's ok if they fall in the pool."very light, durable and thin.The material itself seems like it was good quality though and you get a lot with the stume for your money.Other then that no big problems, it's really durable.I use it once a week and it doing great no fading or stretching.This blouse was lovely and the quality was fine.Are these not checked for quality before being packaged and shipped?This shirt is so cute and mfy, but it fits just as that, a shirt.Material a little thin but otherwise a good deal for the price.This is for mont baby but it's very soft and cute.I was able to wear it and feel great, but it definitely wasn't as cute as I pictured it was going to be.I like it a lot but agree the lace hangs weird, nothing a lil fabric glue or simple stitch can't fix.The fabric suits its purpose and the design is really adorable.Material was very good.That's not very good quality if they fade after only a uple of months.Also the mash trim is too soft.Soft, near-sheer fabric that is lightweight and mfortable.It is what it is for a great priceQuality overall is good.Otherwise, happy with it.The dress is a very light weight and almost see through polyester/tton fabric; the lors are vivid and pattern is attractiveI wish there were other prints.Material is very pretty.Buttons are very nice.Craftsmanship appears to be descent.The arch support ok, but I needed my own.Extremely mfortable overall.I just sewed it back on with invisible thread seems to be holding up well.Quality uld be better, but it's a cute purse.Jacket is from Pakistan and the leather is of the quality expected for the price.The styling is successful.Good Value delivered on time for my eventI am a DD and its hard to find a manufacture that understands that size in less expensive clothing.Very form fitting and I felt like sausage roll in itDid not the quality at allThe fabric is great, but the fit is off.Have to wonder if it's the quality of the garment.TerrificI ordered this with the thought that it would be a useful body shaper, and the additional glute lifter would be appreciated.I have to say that these mittens are not well made however for the price, I expected them to be low quality.The material not so good, doesn't fall wellThey look great, but within hours of having them in, I noticed that tunnels were stripped.lors of bolts and rubber are different otherwise fine you get what you pay for good customer serviceIf you let this dress sit normally on your shoulders the neckline would dip quite low and expose a lot of cleavage which not everyone may be mfortable with.The lace hem looks pretty nice, but the ral lor is closer to NEON in terms of brightness and not really a matte ral as shown in the photo.The sweater was bought as an alternative to my grandma sweaters at work.Just a little delicate.Otherwise a good sweater.There is also a lot of extra fabric length wise- but I guess that's to be expected with a one-size fits all.Other than that, it's a very mfortable summer, lazy day dressThey are not very mfortable and I much prefer a thong.Great ncept.The quality not really goodVery cute love it, but straps do not stay attachedThe fabric is ol and breathable though.Soft and nice for lounging.Is a nice purse just didn't work out for me.I do love the mpartments.I can still make this suit work but the bottoms are definitely looser then I would prefer.I wish they would think to make the front part of the bill a bit stiffer than the rest, so that it wouldn't flop down over baby's eyes.It has a smell to the material and it attracts lint easily.It served that purpose w/o being overtly expensive.I'm a D and there is not enough material to ver my chest.This had such a strong chemical smell I uldn't stand it.I can't imagine that this odor is healthy to breathe in.It is exactly like the picture.Really love the look mostly the mfort but they are a tiny bit too narrow for mplete mfort.The quality is soso for its price, it is definitely good design and look nice on me.Very cute, nice quality.This belt is probably a little better quality than most of the belts advertised as genuine leather'.On a more positive note, I must agree that this belt is better than most.Really good liking I get a lot of mpliments but it is thick and wide so it can be a little unmfortable at times.I love the pockets.i prefer infinity scarves and I did not realize that it was not one, quality was nice.One hat worked perfectly and the other one worked for about minutes then the lights went out.They arrived much faster than expected and the quality is nice for the price.A little too loose in the mid section but I think it would make a great maternity shirt or gym shirt.However, they are very mfortable and I love the design/pattern options.This is very beautiful, but for some reason I thought the beads are bigger than that.It looks good as wrap braceletShiny, satin type of material.not a huge fan of the material but this romper is very cute and can be dressed up with a pair of heels.The straps are adjustable, so that helped.I was not impressed with the quality.Was hoping for more of push up" factor with this top but it's basically just a triangle top.Top is very pretty, feminine and high enough quality material and stitching.For this reason the purchase is perfect.For the price, this is a great top.The graphic is clear and she liked it.The issue with this shirt was really quality.You need to very thin to wear it and I am more regular".These rings are cute and good for the price.material in too thin(can see straight thru); but arrived in good timeAll I can say is that the back support is great.Other than the sizing issue, I am happy with the skirt.It is % wool with nylon lining and lined pockets, tooThe sewing is high quality and the seams, zipper, pockets, belt loops, and pleats are all in the right places with good alignment and stitching.The style of the skirt is old fashioned and I do feel a bit frumpy in it, but I expected that--it looks EXACTLY as pictured.This is a well-made, warm, % wool, full-length skirt and you can't beat the price .).Well, it held in the solid stuff...but didn't stop brown stained pool water from dripping down my toddler's legs into her water shoes.Not as well manufactured as I would have hoped.Great looking product.They are cute but very sharp around my nipples.They seems solid otherwise.I'm not a big sparkle person and there was quite a bit more white sparkle than anticipated.I do wish it was more black beading or that the beading blended more like in the picture but It did fit really well.The sparkle is just a personal preference and a little out of my mfort zone.The material is not breathable" and the size chart for this product is way off.Very mfortable, but look like a pair of pants that my girlfriend wears.The quality wasn't great, but for the price, okay.Otherwise it seems to be good quality and nice lors.This was a nice, thick material.She didn't even wear them because the plane Jetblue) was so hot.Still cute, wish they were all tton.It's cute and stylish but too big for my wrist.Feels like good quality and holds a decent amount of stuff.Hopefully the wrinkles will me out if I hang it.This dress is cute, yes but I wouldn't say high quality and it was misleading because the straps on mine are NOT adjustable as shown.Just don't know what's the front or back, but its a mfy shirtNot a heavy necklace.Very elegant necklace for an affordable price.The dress fits nicely but white is nearly see through.Otherwise, the product is nice/His dress is very nice and good quality material and I liked the cut.This is a very pretty dress, the material is decent silk on the bottom half, transparent lace on top).I love this jewelry set and it is priced so well but unfortunately my elephant ring broke within a few days of wearing it - otherwise I would give it five stars.I still wear the others and for the price I didn't expect super high quality.The scarf ring is lovely and looks really good on scarves.I sandpapered it down and put clear nail polish over it.It is now smooth and safe for my silk scarves.There needs to be better quality ntrol.Sharp hat but just doesn't look right wearing it.It folds outward along the edge, rather than staying close to my skin and providing the needed verage.I hung it in my closet for about two weeks to see if the wrinkles would relax; they did somewhat, but still not enough to give me nfidence that this dress would be easy to take care of and keep it nice looking.I think this dress looks too casual for work or cktails or a wedding; I really don't know what I'd wear it to.My son still wears it, but it is not a good quality.For me it didn't work, but it looked it was made of good quality and durability.It was very mfortable around my legs.Comfy material but run very smallThe quality is not that great which is what I was afraid of.This is a really super cute jumper but the material is not breathable at all.:) once on and just standing in a oler room it's great.They have a good fi, but the fabric isn't too good.Needles are good pierced through dcar tissue with no issues.It leaves no room for swelling or mfortable cleaning.No flexibility in the sole.looks okay.. but does not provide any warmth as the material is not thick enoughOther than the fact it has awesome graphics, the quality is really good.I was assuming that it would be a super soft material.Stitching looks good too.good quality for the price.Shipped fast, Size was perfect, it is very mfortable and if you have a perfect figure you may love it.I guess that's perfect for bedroom wear, but definitely uld not use it outside the bedroom.Not a celery, lime, hunter....It will be cute in the donation bin.Beautiful detail, uld be better.Beautiful and elegant piece.However, it has some minor scratches on each pearl.Very pretty swim suiteIt's much prettier online than in person.The quality of the ring itself is very good.It's a heavy ring.I have issue with the size stones as they have absolutely no shine at all.There's no fire in the stone as they usually is with a higher quality CZ.As far as the products themselves, they are great.Smooth threads, no sharp edges.Not as shiny as the picVery thin material, definitely needs a liner of some type in order to be decent.The necklace is nicely made for the low st.It is light and seems OK quality.Looks better on the model than on me.It is light weight and easily holds the things I find necessary to carry.This is really cute and super mfortable.Can be made in to a cute stume for sure but uld be much better quality from the get-go.Haven't worn it.Very delicate but beautiful, Breaks easily.The clip doesn't hold wellThe design is attractive but the fabric is very thin.Maybe good to wear on a very hot day.It would be nice if they made the same design in a better quality fabric even if it sts more.So these glasses didn't help as much as I had hoped, but he still likes to wear them to see the slight lor variation.They seem to work better outside in bright light.Stitching of seems is not very good quality but the dress is very cute.It washes well and the style wears nice.Having said all this for price it's a great item, just get before time you need it fe alterations.The shirt had a lot of stray threads that I had to carefully trim off to make it presentable.The fabric was not impressive and added to the lack of desirability.Might need to steam before wearing.A few of the links were loose and one was off in the bag with a charm.Love the look of the necklace.Not quality.Not nearly as classy as it looks online.Very shimmery.Otherwise nice fabric.Feels soft and stretchy.The straps and locking mechanism seem sturdy and it would probably work fine on a suitcase without a pull up handle.It stays in place and is beyond mfortable.First the positives- Absolutely gorgeous lor, flows beautifully and keeps you modest with the linings.Look great.Too much glare for me, but for the price they served their purpose.workmanship is below averageA nice pin but I would not wear it.Decent underwear that does not ride up.The band is thicker though still a smooth fit) and the tton ntent is higher %) which means they are less effective with moisture wicking.Otherwise quite nice.The material is somewhat heavier than I expected as well.great product but when wearing the bracelets without a hair band the ends scratch my skin.I love the look but quality leaves a lot to be desired, unfortunately.Otherwise, it is a beautiful beautiful bag.I love this slashed styleIt's OK for the price but there's no mparison in terms of quality.I wouldn't buy it again because you can tan nicely due to the frame.This sweater fits me fine.It's very warm to wear.The lower part of the sweater is very forgiving being flared out with ample room underneath.Since the material is very stretchable, if you pull hard, you uld see your own fingers through the material that if not careful, it's possible to pull out a hole with long sharp nails.When it's ld, I can roll it up that has the effect of a scarf to keep me warm.It's a more refined everyday sweater.Otherwise, the design and quality are really great.This skirt looked very stylish online so I bought the gray one.Thought these were for young girl age , but definitely are for teens..Good quality just not clear on sizing.It's really cute, first, and material is quite soft.They are not cushioned at all very thin.Would like the elastic around the edges to be better too.So I re-glued.(Lace ) I have mixed emotions on this top.Love the feeling on my skin.Nice and silky smooth, almost a turn onDid not know it had hinges..I was hopine it would be oversized and mfortable like in the picture.Rinse them out each night and re-ware the heavy socks for a few days.They feel like great quality other than that.Beautiful kimono ver up.A sturdy strap.Pretty though and got some use out of it.Hence, why I purchased the shirt with polyester blend.Material is soft.It was a gift for my nephew and he actually loves it........just don't know how long it will hold up for him for he uses it everyday and quality of the material is not very strongNice quality, but smaller than I thought.Would have been a nice top to wear to work if it fit.beautifulBought these because I thought the faux lace look was pretty.However, I only got pairs with lace and two solid lor piecesHowever, they washed up nice and are very soft.Great sunglasses.Just make sure to tighten the screws.The style and fabric are ok but not really good quality. Jun : For the price, these are still good, but I would NOT remmend wearing for very long.These eventually dig into your head and leave dimples.It definitely is unmfortable over timeFor brief use, they are fine, so it just depends on how long you plan to wear these.No extra material in the seems to be let out.This dress is what you would expect for the price point, mfortable and cute but simple fabrics in a basic nstruction.Overall, I think they need to literally smooth out the edges, then this would be better.The overall quality seems ok but order a size larger than normal so that you can wear something thick and warm underneath.I love the underwear.It does have built in pins at the ends to hold it in place, it uld use a uple more along the length to make it more rrectly fitted to a variety of hats.the crop top is definitely see through.It's really cute with a place for everything.Inexpensive tanks.That fact, with my broadish shoulders makes a lot of fabric gather up at the shoulders.It is warm though.Expensive for what you get.SEEMED FINE OTHERWISE nice case good presentation.There was no brim on the front which was why I liked it.It is cute but I am not very crazy about the material it's sort of a fleece would be better in a more tailored and crisp material.They have a tendency to slip and can fall off from timed to time.I was very mfortable though. of the buttons came off within an hour of being worn.I freshen them up with cedar oil every few weeks.Great product and about the only thing that nsistently helps with my foot odor.The battery mpartment doesn't really get a good firm fit in the battery, so I'm not sure if they stayed on the whole time.The socks were warm, and did the job, but I wouldn't mind just a tad warmer.Overall, they're good enough until I want to drop more money on a nicer alternative.Not great for long wear.Really liked it then it brokeWarm material...prefect for my son, who won't stay vered at night.Not very flattering, but it's mfy and it was inexpensive, so I'll probably keep it for lounging around the house.Otherwise, they're soft and appear mfortable.Price, great.Looks nice but I have to use the very last hole.I am really happy with these yoga pants.So mfortable and flattering... And didn't break the bank.Just extra fabric on the top doesn't look rightSpend a little more money and get a better quality one piece.Quality and price are great, I love it and I remmend it.The design is greatObviously, the dress is long on me so need to get it tailored.It's a beautiful dress, I love the open back.I was hoping for a mfy yet stylish/tailored for me.But I won't return because it really is super mfy.The fabric isn't thick but it keeps me super warm and so it's also functional.Good quality..Beautiful lines and lapel.....Pat ..FloridaThe product is of good quality.Overall it looks ok.I have blankets from them and love the patterns.I always buy stride rite and paid more than I should have for these to get the right size but I'm a little disappointed with the quality.Very easily ripped but if you're careful you'll be fine.Looks great thoughI didn't want people to be able to see my eyes through the fabric but they can.The material is thick.Otherwise it's good.T-shirt material is not good quality.Well designed.I thought it was a tight crop top it wasn't but I'm still pleased with this itemI definitely do not want to dry it.Basically I can see and it's a nice looking at but the quality it low and ironically the at that was small was better stitched.The fabric was good and so was the style.The shirt itself is high-quality, soft, and has a nice, feminine fit to it.Perfect warm material.The dark aquamrine are more valuable than all.So when I saw this ring I had to have it.All in all its a beautiful ring.Picture looks better than the shirt does.The necklace is beautiful and good quality, but the ashes will not go in.solid nstruction, nice feel.I got these shoes to prevent my toes from ripping .this product the picture is better than the actual product the glow is just a dab of glow in the dark paint.Not gift quality.They are very mfortable.They don't feel very well made.The bag itself was well made but it wasn't really what I was looking for once I got it.Cool but narrow.This is not as pretty in person.I cut off the extra length and just tie it in front and that looks fine.The fabric is thin and so the unlined bottom and light lor shows little bulges not attractive on me.I liked the material and all.Stitching was viewable.Came early, but I must have gotten the plastic version because it is not leather.It is a very delicate necklace almost to delicate.generally good materialComfyIt's the price you pay for and does the job until my eyes catch something better.The Dress is beautifulThis is beautifully made, I bought it sizes up though and it still wasn't quite what I wanted.Great buy for the price.Quality was what I expected as in not that great but ok for the price) as I have another pair of vinyl boots made by Pleaser.Very soft fabric.The fabric was swooshy and reminded me of athletic material.Its perfect for sleeping or lounging only.I have to get use to this not so mfortableThey're a great fabric for running and they breathe well.but you're not running to be stylish, so whatever, I like them fine enough.Quick shipping, thin material.The picture suggests better quality.The material is really mfy.It's a cute dress, yes.I love the way they feel but I received a pair for my birthday in a large, which is what I usually wear and it gives me a loose fit for sleeping but they are a it tight to be that mfortable.These are super cute and very mfortable, but...they're all polyester.If your feet aren't bothered by all-poly socks, treat this as a five star review.Very nicely made.Very cute, pocket is sideways but that's fine.Soft and okPerhaps it's just my preference in style.Hopefully, they will shrink some since they are % tton.It's light flow good summer shirt.When I opened the package and saw the dress and how well it was sewn, I was pleasantly surprised.All gems and sequined beautifully placed and seen.Otherwise it was ol.Awesome quality.The perfect pajama material with a little give but still warm.Now that said, these are very soft, they ver a larger area.I think these would do really well in northern climates.Nice product- softness is mparable to LuluRoe.This item is pretty much exactly a pictured.The finish is a gun metal grey it the item feels solid.They seem mfortable but I have not worn all day as weather not warm enough yet.I like the adjustable ring though.But is is a lovely dressI use it for water aerobics jacuzzi about x per week, but have had to replace times is months.Quality is good, but it is not a sweater jacket it is tton and not as long as photos show.I love it, I thought it was larger, but I can work with itHowever, for the price, it was satisfactory.They are beautiful and fit perfectly but have left green residue on the inside of my nose from wearing the same ring for days straight.In fact, the flat bottom does not have any grip or texture to prevent slipping.We have tile and hardwood and she will not be able to use these at home.They are solid and not see through.I do not see these as being warm.The material is like for a splay.These are not the same quality as the black ones and st more than double the price.a little more room up front would be nicefabric edges are not finished as I expected.The quality of the shirt looks much nicer in the picture.I loved this product when I first put it on.It held up wonderfully throughout the initial stages of the ball I attended.Legs fine.The arch support is good and the shoes appear to be very well nstructed, but I need cushioning in the ball of my foot, and these just didn't have enough.Looks exactly like thisThe material is rough, steamed it and it is still on the stiff side but for the price of standard veils this was a good dealThe quality wasn't as good as it looked on the pictureBut sometime it gets caught on things--this is not a problem with other belly button rings I have.I wouldn't say these are the softest or most mfortable wrist warmers I've ever had, but they were okay.They do keep them warm I guess, but they're a tiny bit scratchy, in my opinion.While the belt itself is of quite high quality, it is a stretch to say it's appropriate as a ample amount of belt for a " waist.As far as quality it feels nice and looks okay but you can tell it's fake.This scarf is great quality, but the lor is NOT as pictured.but i still love the material and the bathing suit.I bought these shoes for work They're not as mfortable as the others I've bought Wasn't true to sizeI looked at the stume at a local retailer and did not buy it because of the differences from the photo on the package and the actual stume.It hangs well below the waistband.Material is not real thickThis was really disappointing because I love the texture of the material, the lors and designthe bracelet its self is really good and good quality for the price but if you have a smaller wrist then its not going to fit well.Home wear only.However the piece is absolutely beautiful and very well made, I would order from this seller again keeping in mind it runs a tad small )Doubly challenging for a nursing topThere are better sandals for this price point in my opinion.The quality of this purse is ok.Perfect for dinner on vacation.Nice fabric, resistant.This is a really beautiful piece of jewelry.I really liked it, but the wing broke from the heart and I just haven't had time to see what to do to fix it.Great material The waist is not mfortable.I have been trying to loose weight, so I'm thinking they'll be more mfortable when I get down pound.The price is OK, but I've gotten more quality for the same money on Amazon in the past.But this is a good alternative.But the bottom line is the luggage stap is fully adjustableloved the necklace, but it came with two broken flowers, as expected for the price.made from durable and washer friendly material also.Feather is not smooth.Arches were too high for my feet.Basically an iron on shirt but my daughter loved it so that is all that mattered.Fun but not great qualityHeavy duty fabric, well made and easy to wear.I had to get it altered a little st me ) and now it looks great.There were some areas of the dress that looks like it wasn't made well my tailor fixed it.OK but not great shirts, quality is not the best.Very nice maxi dress over all and lined you can wear this to dinner or for a stroll on the beach.If you are not a healthy chested person this dress is very nice.It is a high rise so need to lift up so won't have a bulge or show under clothing.not sure of the material, is okayOk, the amount of glass provided is a bit cheezy small) and there is a difference but i'm not sure its all that dramtaticIt was fleece - thicker than I expected since I wanted to wear it under a bike helmet.Bulky, lowers screen responsiveness tremendouslyThis piece is visually pretty, however, it didn't fit me as well as I would have liked with the deration disappearing into my navel.Awesome idea very soft material.Still more mfortable than uniform store bough ones.The hangers are pretty good.Cute cheep cat necklace.Good for layeringThe material was good quality though and I really loved the shiny scale print and bright purple top, so I'm going attempt to turn it into a two-pieceThis is really pretty pattern and decent quality for the price.Idk if I'm liking this wallet but it was pricey so I'll keep it for now.But not sure if they are sterling silver.Very soft, mfortable but runs a little smaller shorter) than expected for a small.But otherwise prettyVery beautiful but a little stiff, not as soft as i'd imagine or would like.It is not two toned, just all solid navy denim.A uple of points of interest, the Fabric: % Ice silk, is listed as Polyester on the tag and the wash care instructions indicate that they can't go in the dryer.It would be adorable for a teenager and is not quiet as sexy" as the pictures here.But overall I will make it work.I love the bottoms, and the top is exactly like another style I bought the same day, who would have thunk I got three suits that are exactly alike under three different order titles, and makers?I aspect better quality from Vera Bradley.I love the details with the tassels but they me right off.Used as a ver up and it was perfect for thatShow a little lace ) I wore it over my regular white bra, and it adds a nice touch.Perfect w a summer outfit Overall quality, is ok.There are adjustable shoulder straps.And the loop isn't sewn well.Costume jewelry.Great for a date night but not every day useI would love it more if it were more waistline friendly for plus size people and if the zipper didn't randomly break I wasn't wearing it.i liked this shirt immediately from looking at it, when i got it it was loose fit and mfortable.The design was fantastic it just came to me wrinkled.Very mfortable but WARMmultilayered materials don't breathe very well.Cute but not for hot days.I have purchased the MOON two times, the send one hadn't such a clear image.I did not like the fabricThe graphic is really pretty though, will have to see how well it does in the wash.Overall I got what I expected in quality and fit.They feel very soft, though.Item needs LOTS of ironing.Cute but not quite rightThe tton is nice enough.The fabric feels a little scratchy due to the pattern on the shorts.I fell in love with this cardigan just from the picture...I got the cardigan and its absolutely beautiful but the feel of it has to be the most awkward thing in the world.This suit is really cute and of good quality.It cuts in too much for my liking.Super cute and sturdy.Nice spring hingeThe print wore off very quickly, but it is a stylish and nice backpack.I loved the fabric and embroidery.It is very unique and made very well.They have no elastic in them so they easily ride up and show off my bottom.Love the t shirt.Material is very see through.Good quality fabric and cut for the price.But overall the quality is great and I love itLiked the feel, smooth fabric, holds the package well.Product material is not very good.Super cute and sparkly though(wink) Material is very soft and pattern was very cute.Not a soft shirt but looks nice.They have a great design and great feel, but just don't meet my height.It's very mfortable material.The quality is pretty good, especially for that price.bought for a friend who has peripheral neuropathy in his feet, and I thought these would be perfect to keep his feet warm as the ad said they were expensive too.They do not keep his feel warm; however, he kept them and said that maybe in the summer they would.Fabric is thin but overall it's niceThe boots are pretty good quality and still look cute without the bunnies so overall I am happy with them.It looks great on line but not so great on me.The build quality is nice.Super cute and warmThese are nice pants for the price.If I hold them up to the light, can see through them easily.Fit is mfortable.The material is decent though we have only washed it once, hung to dry with no issues that I see as of yet.I think the quality is okay.It it a solid . stars.It was not well sewnSuit was well made and soft.Gives nice heal cushion, but not really much for arch support.I have normal arches and this doesn't have enough arch support to help my plantar fasciitis at all.It would have made a great normal' insole.Doesn't do much for the plantar issue, but it is a cushy heal protection.If the dress weren't so inexpensive, I would return it.Very cute tton top.His job is very dusty and he needs a zipper wallet to keep the abrasive dust off of his credit cards.This wallet did not keep the dust out as well as others.Beautiful lors and breathable material, but the L is definitely a medium and the XL is a Large.it was inexpensive and it looks okayMine did me in a Chamilia box and looks greatI had to cut off the jump ring/tag.Very lightweight and works well when a light tee shirt isn't enough, but a sweater is too much.I bought this for NYE but didn't end up wearing it due to the fabric.The fabric reminds me of a Halloween stume- stretchy and not put together well.Great bookbag strong and durable but the picture gets dirty quickly and the stains don't me right out but other than that its a good buyCute, but has no tummy support.Strap is definitely pleather."Material isn't quite I expected but it's still a very nice blouse.It like the ring well enough although the lor is a bit too shiny.Shiny gold.This purse would be better with a tan strap.Bountiful blouse...This product does not have any tag and I don't think it is linen or, if it is, is not a very good quality of linen.:( It ripped in such a way that I'm not sure it can be salvaged, since it's right underneath the llar in a long tear.Nice but the chain links weren't solid, they had splits in them.Material is soft and seems to be well nstructed, but beware of sizingLooked greatSo watch those tiny screwsThe fabric is not great quality, I'd be surprised if they survived the current season if I keep them.Not too great on quality.Adds a decent layer of warmth for casual temperature changes, from inside to out and back again.Form fitting so they are not detected under pants.not very mfortable but it is pretty.These shoes are very loose, which works for me but is somewhat alarming because my feet are wide and these were still loose although somewhat mfortable, so it worked out.It does loosen a lot so you must retie the strings often but looks awesome.this socks is NOT FOR Toddlers, im gonna keep it for me and find another socks for my baby years)Not as cute in person.Nice quality, nstruction, appearance, but uld stand to be a little bigger.The picture looked better than the actual necklace.It was ok the material was just ok no big thing.It is more like a light sweater in heaviness.The material feels nice and the fit is good.The reason for three stars is that the yoke pattern is not matched.All together it's very cute though.Fir smaller phones I suppose it would be greatThe neckline plunged to below my bust line... Now I know we Caribbean girls dress for the heat, but that's no reason to have everything hang out*shudder* Having said that, thus would be a good ver up for the beach.Nice t-shirt but the material is too heavy.The quality is to be expected, it's a T shirt.LOOks like clear stone but wasn't very dark marbled.Also there is no lining in the chest, which I don't feel mfortable with.I'd expected a slightly higher qualityNice material, good fit for my wife but the waistband twist in the waistline of the pants but over all pleasedOtherwise material feels mfyI love the style of it and think it's very beautiful.The linen is beautiful, the workmanship is excellent and the lors are great.It wasn't a downpour, but a steady drizzle and the jacket did keep me dry.Beautiful shirt, loved the look of it.Otherwise excellent blousePRODUCT IS SEE THRU, I CAN ONLY USE IT AS A SLEEPING SHIRT....GOOD SIDE, MY HUSBAND HAS NO COMPLAINTS..Not exactly the quality of fabric I was anticipating but it will do for an knit shirt.It only looks good if I scrunch them up.It does not look graceful or classy.I tried to use it for a week but after the week I gave up.Wish it was whiter.Qualify fabric and nicely made.Still good qualityOne pair that I loved broke.Material nice and soft.I had to let them air out' for a few days before it went away.Although it is very lightweight material it has a nice shine to it.The nose holder part fail off at rd week . anyway it's good for this priceGreat for working out in.It's kind of a stretch material and silky feeling, so it tends to ride down.It's ok but looks even cheaper than I thought.The material of the shirt is not stretchable so u have to be careful when u put it on but it's niceCompletely sheerThe picture makes it seem very flattering but the way its made is off.It is cut like an ordinary once piece bathing suit full verage on the but.My daughter loves this skirt.It's super mfortable. stars due to the fact that after day worn and wash it's already looking worn.TOP FITS OKAY IF YOU TIE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE PICTURE.(I GUESS THAT HOW IT WAS MADE TO BE ROCKED).Pretty jewelry, thoughNice design, material feels nice but sizing runs a little smallIt's a dense fabric.It doesn't seem very well made.It doesn't stretch well.Very nice fabric, but one size does not fit all.They are a little loose on her, but mfy.These are great pants, and the fleecy inside does make them more mfortable than your average sweatpants.Cute cardigan, very soft.Nice lined and warmLace is very high quality however the other fabric is not, makes it feel cheap instead of mfy with a touch of elegance.It's not as flowy as the picture.It is extremely soft though so I'm sure it will be very mfy.The piece is very attractive.However, as the price indicates, it is cheap.I do have a hot glue gun so I was able to repair it.That being said, the metal is a heavy durable metal for both the earrings and the chain.It's just a casual mfy shirtIt's beautiful, nice material.This bra was sooo mfortable and I wanted so much for it to workif you can do a rubic's cube you might be able to figure out the top's strapping.This fists nice around my back and such.Looked good on me but my boobs would literally me out just bending over to pick up something, I wore it around the house when I disvered that, Thank god.Very Cute Stretchy but Bow broke off after use I able to fix it myself, but just worried how long they will last.Not the best material but still good quality, slightly see through, I love PERSUN and the quality of the clothes.The dress is well made and lovely.It didn't look good on me.Some of the gloves acquired holes in them after on a few uses/ washes, however when you nsider you pay . for one pair in the store the valie is still good.cute top- not that flattering on but good quality, good serviceThe lor is great and you won't have to worry about fading or stretching, because of the material, but it will not keep you warm on a winter day.Two shirts I love have holes now.Nice and light, fit well, look good.Love that it arrived quickly however to be honest the quality of the material is low.Initial feelings on the hat it's very firm.There is a nice elastic band on the interior to take up any slack if you prefer something like that.My wife tried it on and said it was huge on her... After I sweat it in this weekend, it may fit better.It is plenty strong since it is steel.Comfortable, the latex smell is strongI'm not sure if it was the material or what.But other than that, I thought they were great quality and I received them much sooner than expectedIf it's a waist trainer what good does it do on the outside?Other than that it's mfortable and doesn't bend in sharp edges, it more like flows with your body.The chain is way too short, and the clasp doesn't work well.The material is thick so it'll good nice with leggings and boots in the winterWarm?(Yes I keep hoping it's a fluke) It really makes a difference, the firmer sole provides more support and more mfort.The lour is pretty and the fabric was decent for the price.No wonder price was so reasonable.THat is not Tibetan Silver.I have Tibetan silver.Nice dress just not for my shapePrettier online then in personPretty good for stume jewelry.The idea of this set is super hot however the material is exactly like that of a thin tton t shirt.The skirt is see through between your legs if you are in the bright light, shouldn't be a problem out in a club.Summary, it's worth the inexpensive price for one or two nights out.Every little imperfection you're trying to hide it's there in your face, not to mention the shape and lor of your underwear.They slide right off because the earpiece is-just straight, no curves to hold the straps in place.Not mpletely as pictured.This case is amazing when you first get it, but is easily damaged.Nice quality but tight around toes.Cute and mfy but the bottoms were a little short.its ok. looks and feels like plastic up close lol but looks nice from a farI have a nice rope around my neck.Gave you three star because I was surprised at the material, thought it would be tton, and the lors are not as bright as the picture.I wish material was thicker.Dress looks very mature for my taste.Most belts I buy like this are very stretchy..I gave stars because it's pretty and I might like it better once I lost my baby weight.I was expecting these capris to be the same material as the pants that I own and love from Cotton Cantina, however, they're more like leggings than pants.Was hoping the lor was brighter, But came days sooner the expected date.Its mfortable but VERY informal.It doesn't look like the picture exactly of urse but still great for your money I think.It'll be cute with jeans and boots or moccasins this fall and the quality is pretty good for the price.Not sure how the lor will hold with repeated pool use and I probably uld have selected a more flattering swim short.Its a nice hoodie with quality materials.It would only really be useful in maybe slightly windy weather.Other than that, it is beautifulNice tights, just want I wanted, warm, but I'm not even '" and these are too short.horns are hallow and made of a soft foamI have purchased quite a number of pyjama sets for my son.Great socks.There's no stitching at the top so they kind of just roll down, but they're still very mfortable.I took and removed those and gave it my personal touch in an American English type of way.The box looks to be and smells like an walnut very strong very well built pretty heavy, very pleased.The jewelry is very well made but uh oh.....But the craftsmanship very well worth the price.Just wish that there was an size chart for the jewelry.Overall for the trip it was fine but would not be able to wear this in everyday life or in place were people know me.If I have seen photos for the shirt from the front I would not buy it, as I liked it because of the details on the back.I kinda like it, just not as beautiful as I expected only because of the way it looks from the front).Not as nice as the picture by a long shot.Alpine Swiss put out great productsThe Vader mask is magnificent.This jacket looks cute in the photo but is not well made.Material is light.It's a lot cuter with a cardigan over it.The quality is nice, but I like my hats to fit a little looser than this.Would be better if the padding was attached to the bra.Looks cute from the back but does not provide the support I was looking for.Not as classy as it looks in the pics.It is adjustable but not removable.Also, the clips don't grab on well.It looks better in the pictureBunches up a lot and not mfortable because of it.These shoes look good.My son says they are mfortable.He said his feet were not hot after wearing these shoes all day.It has a great look and feel to it but im just very picky.The only problem, which is kind of a biggy, is they get these holes in them rather mysterious and quickly.The skirt is cute.Will only work for smaller bra's not D) or ones without underwire.Not in good qualityIt shows any cellulite that you may have and bc of the material anu shapeware will be seen.On the rd pic you can see my hand through it just to show you how clingy it is and how it shows everything.product fist perfectly, quality wise it's ok.These are heavy, post are not very strong to support the roses.All wasn't Iost though I gave the at to my daughter and she loves the at she says it's soft and warm.I'm not a stunning amazon.The ating on the glass is very important.I uld see how cheap it was made but I really liked it for a uple bucks.Quality wise it seemed fine, padded cups I like padded and underwire) bottoms adjustable since they tie on the sidesThis outfit is really just for looks, I don't think it's very functional lol.These feel good until about the th mile.The material and feeling of it is great.But OK quality and was shipped quickly.Over all, it's a nice shirt for the priceBut this dress will work well for a family holiday gathering or whatever.These are nice earrings; substantial and shiny with some sparkle.The fabric feels mfortable but the shirt didn't fit me.But definitely not a push up... Quality, breathable fabric and lined bottoms will deffinetly lead me to buy another lor or pattern fir the great price.this is a good stuff, work perfectly with my solar g shock.very scratchy materialI don't like the feel of the nylon-y material.Great value for the price.Is exactly what itbsays it is and good qualityOther wise looks great I was able to bend them back to the right position hope they last, but are cheap biker glasses..I just received my pullover and I was pleased it looks exactly like the picture and was nicely made.Beautiful print however the material is very...meh.Great material, but definitely an all out thong sui.Comfy for round the house but will not keep you warm if looking for to wear outside in ld weather.Nice gown, well made, good value... but pictured as being longer than it actually is.The lace straps uld have been a better quality.Ill keep them though, I'm expecting in November and the fold over top is great with my growing belly.The material feels nice.Material is very thin but will serve well as a bathing suit ver up.Had a strong chemical spell but it washed out.They look pretty good so far and they stay on.The skirt isn't very well made.Pretty, but these had like a fog inside the glass, and paint on the outside, so I won't be giving them to anyone but my granddaughters to play with.I thought I might use them later for circus arts classes but the shimmer on them is stume quality.The pockets are nice, though, and the canvas seems to be pretty good.Love this over size sweather have not cleaned it yet.Nice quality, a bit tight around the shoulders and ordered a medium.It nice, love the leather smell, but doesn't look like its going to last long.I believe they will tear easily.I like the material it's soft but does not look like the picture it's okThe picture looks better than the actual product.It's one of those items that look better on the hanger or on the model than they do actually on you.Overall shorts are niceThe padding that came in it is definitely not one size fits all.The quality is good and nice finish.But made wellno stockings or gloves included fits very tight around the bust with no room to spare fabric is NOT stretchy so make sure your measurements are exact NOT remmended for curvy' womenComfortable socks.Cute design and fabric.The packaging while protective was shotty at best.... Had to pry packing tape off the ring and was looking forward to a gift bag by it actually is a gift.The suit was great quality and very pretty.Nice oversized scarf.the first pair I got was beautiful, the stones sparkled so nice but then I ordered another pair for a gift and they did not turn out so wellIt feels nice and love the material but it barley fits me.they're okay, just don't machine wash them because they are Very delicate.it's a good starter bra if you have small boobs but not very durable.Husband loved it but only gave stars because it was not a great fit and was not as white as should be plus was more like teas hire.Nothing wrong with the shoes quality.The quality is so-so, as is the fit and finish.I feel that the padding is just right for me-light enough that I can feel the ground beneath me while enjoying the benefits of some padding...good for lifting and some running.Bottom will remain planted but not enough reinforcement to stop your foot from moving within the shoe catastrophe for high speed work.He's worn it, but probably just to be polite or out of nvenience.I think with some home made shims it might work.I like the design and quality of it.A little on the thin side, but still nice enough; however, they feel like they won't last a long time and uld easily run.Very nice but already broken I used it only once.Might be cute enough for a school dance but not really the quality I would wear to a formal event.Probably made somewhere for cents plus shipping.Earrings are very large too mfortable to wear.I'm '" the dress is long and will only need to be altered if you're planning on wearing flats.For the price I really expected David's Bridal Dresses to be more elegant and better quality.The top is much fuller blousey than the pictures.But it's made well for the price.fix well but was disappointed with the quality of the materialI had to have it cleaned and buffed due to scratches and other material not being cleaned off it.Would be great as a belt clip.But, she loves it and she looks beautiful it.this fits great and feel nice but there are spots that the threads are no good as u can see from the photos.I do like the at but it's not what I expected quality wise.The barbell part is great but the actual skull isn't stainless steel so it tarnishes.It is very good also for preventing slipping and falling when in the pool and out of the pool.The only thing I do not love is how much water is holds so the water is sloshing around in the shoes when he gets out of the pool to run around the backyard grass.It's nice haven't used it yet.This is a good no-frills belt for the price charged.There are belt loops on the belt.It would work better for dress pants.The ring is somewhat as expected.Disappointed that the goldplating in the center not as brilliant as presented or described.The material just isn't good to wear as a slip but it's very mfortable.Great quality hatOn the positive, the material is awesome and it looks great.The material for this dress was just beautiful.They are pretty long and hard to get in but I just cut it and was able to get them in easier.Very cute though and good quality.Nice stretchy tton material.Other than that they look greatI wasn't expecting the llar to be ruffled the way it is, but my significant other loves it.I own a pig skin jacket so I figured a hat of the same material might be ol.This pig skin hat is not as soft as I hoped for.Looks good, but wayyyy overpriced nsidering these are probably ordered from China for well under a buck each.Although this bag is lovely, I didn't find it be worth more than -It is very spacious and can hold a lot of stuff.Didn't expect it to be so stretchy.The rings that hold the excess strap had some powder at or paint missing as soon as it came out of the package as well.I wear it all year long.In the winter I just put a sweater or long sleeved shirt over it and then people think it's a skirt, I do the same in the summer with a shirt, it give the outfit more style versatility.It has broken too many times to unt and just last week it popped so I am not happy.Good quality on pendant.It's hard to wear a bra with this top, so if you are not chesty it may not stay up well.Quality is ok for the st.Iffy qualityThough the quality of the belt seems very good, a floating belt loop is rediculous and will easily be lost.I love these pants the lour is beautiful and they are super mfortableI hope they make it thru the rd wear....They seem very affordable but at  per wear ..and it is beautiful.Didn't like the feel of the fabric.They don't fit on some of my more expensive pieces which is disappointing but they work great when they do fitGood quality smelt funnyCute otherwise.But it's very well made, and I think a very fair price, so I can't really knock it.but the fabric is sturdy and I haven't had any buckling with the plastic bones.I wasn't a fan of the material.Such a cute suit...... good quality.The material was not the same, sheer, and not as stretchy.Very soft material, but wrinkles very easily.Overall it's ok, but expensive.This dress would probably be good looking on a taller person, but on my ' somewhat rounded frame, it was not flattering at all.Seemed to be well made, however.Not pliable enought.They are nice but I like my clothing to breath a little more.they are super fitting... and the material is more for winter then summer in California..However, the top is made decently and the fabric is a nice weight.For the price, I'm happy to have this wear around the house.Cute topOk quality hat.Well made, as pictured,Quality leaves a bit to be desired; you can see the clear outline of a square around the screen printing.Comfy, and served its purpose.Not quality enough to have me ming backIt is pretty see through and my husband wasn't happy about that.The material under the lace is very warm.Style not as expected.Material was cheaper than expected.I live in Houston, Texas; and it is hot and humid.I sew my own vintage dresses, but it sts so much more in fabric and time to sew my own than to buy one.Love this sweaterIt's a very warm sweater, great for a ld winter day or night.I love the button embellishment.It adds to the overall beauty of it.I washed it once, in a lingerie bag, gentle cycle, ld and hung it to dry.Love the material and print....top of pants uld be longer.Received glasses in the mail and checked quality.Frame quality appears to be good.They arrived well wrapped, lenses protected, and had a protective cloth bag, also with microfiber cleaning rag.But I will say that my posture was amazing for a few sends.I also needed to wear a sports bra under the top to keep the gals in place.Comfortable, but the heart on the end fell off after about weeks and was lost... replaced it with a charm that I had laying around so it still works fine.Would be better if the heart charm was placed on better so it didn't me off.This necklace is really nice but I thought that it would have been more sparkly in person.The chain itself appears to be more chrome than silver but it is still beautiful and eye-catching.This necklace is beautiful and it fits how I expected but the gold is already starting to fade at the nnecting chainSeemed to be made with good quality.However it is light and airy and perfect to wear on a hot summer day.They are fine, nothing spectacular in terms of fit, materials, design etc.The expanded version is H U G E. Fabric appears sturdy and bright.the large fit snug and the material is cheap polyester looking so it doesn't as great as the picture but..The cut is ideal for layering, hiding both stomach and hips.I wear a F bra and was worried it would fall open but it hangs nicely in front.It's just the material that makes it so clingy.Item was not longer then my waste and I and ' however still received plenty of mplimentsBut other than that, it's a decent dress for the price.Beautiful patternthin thin thin shipping was good seems to be ok in craftsmanship no flaws seen so I like but not loveOtherwise good pouch and materials.Not dissatisfied, but had better female things.I'm going to try and fix them without breaking them.But the material is very goodWould have liked the material a little heavier.This top is more tight than other Patty tops that I own.Thick fabric, fast shipping and much like the picture. stars for the item.He has very sensitive skin.Both are nicely made and seem warm.Because I do love some necklaces.They are little hot and does not have enough ventilation in my point of view.If outside is ld it will be ok, but if not, they are a little hot for me.Are very strong.Quality was not as beautiful as on the picture.Not prom quality.So giving starts for that reason not the hat quality, which was fine to me.Great piece to wear to start a nice peaceful nversation.Comfy and really breathes.However, I do like the material and pattern, perhaps, this will be a better option for my post-pregnancy phase.Doesn't lie as nicely on the shoulders as this photo does.Other than that great lor and screen printing.It was vibrant and looked like it had great support.Neat design, longer than expected so it vers your neck well.inside, they take on that same smell.Other than that, it a great tank and quality.The only reason I give it stars was because I was able to ice it to some one and the quality of the tank.The bottom hem curves up when washed and won't stay downGreat scarf, but don't be fooledI got this item really quickly and it is very pretty.As A Magnetic Titanium Bracelet, it look true to picture and not at all heavy as others I have bought.Now depending on the amount of dismfort and reason for buying it, this will be a factor.Can wear them mfortably for several hours.As one might expect from the price and the fact it ships from China, the quality is anything but remarkable.That said, for the price it is crafted well enough.The white bubble eye' on mine had some chalky residue and the white line at the top of the eye is not a reflection from light.Bottom line; if you want a ol, kitchy little party favor or bobble, then this is a great purchase for you.If you were looking for something a bit more fancy OR functional, well then....keep on looking, LOLWould be more flattering if it had a tighter fit, but still looks beautiful on the back so I am keeping it.Didn't quite get it in time for Christmas, but the pants are really cute and really soft.I prefer the gel kind better.Fit great, it's a good mfortable tton tshirt.Nice socks to wear.Great for important business meeting and to bring some spicy flavor to the office.Otherwise she loved it.Overall a super cute mask and good quality for the price.Product was delivered on time and was described with detail.very good qualityHaven't worn itThese are perfectThis Bodysocks Inflatable Ride Me Unirn is super cute.I wear one to work each day because they provide support, yet are SUPER mfortableI have yet to find a sports bra that gives me the hold and support that I need when running with just one bra.But, at least with these bras, like I said before, they're so mfortable, EVEN with of them onGood clarity, low internal reflection.It feels right but little loose for me.My wife purchased this women's v-neck to wear to work in as a teacher.Teachers need to be mfortable and professional at the same time.She likes the material because it is very soft and not to thin.The seams are sewn well and should hold up over time and use.It's always my top brand of all day mfort kicks.love the dress .. only wish there was a slit up the sideVery simple and cute.Very mfy fits greatfits well, a little delicate but fun to wear.So uniqueLight weight and mfortable.Great products for the price.Haven't tried it as of yet, but the nstruction, material weight, and appearance are all quite nice.My only problem is that the diamond is a bit fake looking other than that they are good.This is a really great jacket that is mfortable and looks the part.Great leggings.They are mfortable and got nicelyJacket was warm and mfortablePerfect for kids.These socks are a great valueHigh quality and great design.Very nice qualityJust perfectGood mfy pants long days at work I'm hard on clothes if I get a year out of it I'm happy and I get my year?very mfy.....I liked it.Very mfortable stylish.BEAUTIFULLY MADE.IT IS VERY WELL MADE.Love the material, love the feel of it against my skin.Very beautiful look.I uldn't wear this throughout my entire pregnancy but it did last well into my send trimester.I didn't realize it had a built in little bra.Really soft.I believe it will soften over time.Decently priced .Comfy, unlike some nipple jewelry Cons: .But as I read, some have gone bad due to them being fake jewelry".In my personal experiences, ALL jewelry I have bought on amazon which is A LOT) has never went bad".Overall happy w it tho for the price.Cute designThe fabric is great, and the designs are fun.I features I like are that it's lightweight and that you can pack it into its own pocket to make it easier to transport.Cute and mfy leggings.These showed up more quickly than I expected.Decent for the st but the smell tells me that they aren't safe to use a lot.Very nice fabric.A little stretch to it, makes it mfortable and able to move with you.They are somewhat flimsy, yet, still durable and hold their shape.I am not a fan of the material, though.It's not particularly mfortable, and it doesn't really breathe.Washes well too.Very ol but detaches very easily.Soft and mfortable.The cufflinks themselves are really good quality.To fix this, I just wrapped a bow around the box which worked really well.Love this robe.Super soft and mfortable.When purchasing this robe, it is important to realize that it is made to be mfortable and not super sexy.They look great and have held up to

tie).Only gave stars because I'm not % sure that the strap is real leather, but it's leather enough for my purpose.If you are going to use this as a stume piece, make sure you get it in enough time to weather it a bitThis product is great for the lazy dresser like myself.Very sheer as stated in other reviews and the quality is as expected for the priceExactly like it is pictured.This is not a real stone though.It is more of a plastic resin, as Opalite is not a real stone Google it).BUT it is very lovely on.The chain I was sent is a bit different, more of a flat chain, and I actually like it better than the one in the picture.The photo is awesome though.They do bend easily but real silver, no reaction in my ears even though I wear them everydaybeautiful....Great child's umbrella.Keeps the wind off as well as the rain.Very cute and mfortable.I like the soft material.Feels substantial weight/feel) and it operates well.It's made really well and it stretches slightly so it has a lot of

gotten plenty of mpliments.Very light material perfect as PJ not as much as a stumeVery nicely designed shirt, soft fabric, pretty lor.Pretty, I needed more room in bust area.Very good value for Nato bands.The leather strap is adequate, but not that great looking.nice dress but the cloth is very thin.The green is more of a mossy green which is still nice.The problem, which I can fix using the fabric I removed for shortening, is that it fits tight through the chest and shoulders.It was very nice and for the price was absolutely perfect.Made of rayon so keep that in mindGreat uples stumes.These are a little thicker than I had hoped for but they seem like fine socks.The knitting is great quality and very soft.I love this wallet.Other than that great shirt.Very warm, nice

lined with tton.Shoulder straps are lacy/frilly and not supportive) so older users may not love it as much, but is perfect for her.Nice shiny sturdy chain with extra chain to make it longer.All in all its a pretty necklace.Overall very happy with the bag.This is a well made product.The design though should have made more room in the front.Beautiful:) But they're super cute, appear to be very mfy

of like it its so light and mfortable, great for Texas layeringGood strong quality and long enough for anyone.Fit well and stayed ol" really mfortableThe material is durable and easy to wash and doesnt appear to scratch or scuff easily.Warm and mfortableWell made...fit as expected.Great quality for the priceThey really do help support my feet and relieve the dismfort of plantar fasciitis.Nice dress for the price.It was good but it would be better is the note was metal instead of plasticOtherwise, for the price it's good.Works to hook two together or to hook a mitten to jacket sleeve so the little ones do not take them off while playing in the snow.The inside material is somewhat cheap, but it's still great for the price.I'm glad I did as it fits pretty well with a little loose feel probably best for dancing).The material isn't the best there is out there but that is what you expect for the price.Overall look was good.This little dress is very cute and very well made for the priceIt's like a water proof type material that doesn't seem like they would be very mfortable, but the dress is definitely worth purchasingExcellent quality and also cheap.It's heavy and suitable for

personGreat quality for the price.I love that it has snaps, since my niece has a very slim wrist.Fits well, and stylish.When i fish got it the zipper's looked as if they were broken but i just worked them a bit and they are fine.One tassel came off and was easily put back on with a pair of pliers.I washed this dress in ld water and put it in the dryer and it came out just fine.The belt seems well made.The mechanism is actually very easy to use but it's on the bottom of the buckle and not visible when it's on.works great, good priceGood quality fabric, that gives, but holds its shape.The metal is a bit more gold than the picture shows, but they still look good.Great for lounging.very spacious and NonbulkyRuns a small in the chest area if you're a big chested woman, but beautifully made even

Only mplaint is one of the snaps fell off very early on and needed to be replaced...Could be a little softer but is soft enoughI got this, and uldn't be happier about how cute it is, though, the belt was what stops it from being stars, as it was significantly looser than it needed to be.but overall very soft and mfyThe fabric is nice and they seem well nstructed.Quality for the price.Kind of sheer and long for me but really cute-love the popping lorsNice hairpiece.This skirt is " longer than the other skirts.Love the fringe on the bottom but guess it will have to go to when I hem it.very

price.Product was nice, very soft.It was a gift for my daughterCute bowsWater has salt and chlorine.Great shoe for the beach.This is a very cute and well-made swimsuit.The work great.Because I haven't worn it long enough I obviously haven't washed it yet either.The shirt itself was soft to touch very soft on my skin.The shirt isn't thick material.the shirt is lovely and feels nice.These are cute necklaces and inexpensive, I got the red and black ones.This was perfect.The pattern is very subtle.These little socks helped prevent some nasty blisters.Very mfortable when dry.Thought they would wick away moisture like Duluth Buck Naked underwear, but not as effective.I love the price and quantity for these and the different variety.Beautiful fabric, thick material and an awesome purchase for the money assuming you can get it by way of Amazon Prime, that is.For a bra-hating person, they are the perfect solution unless you need some uplifting).Nice shirt...good price.Product arrived on time and looks good too, but the bells came off when opened.This is a very feminine, pretty blouse.but good quality, uld pair with leggings or dark tights.Worked out perfect for my daughters prom dress.Heavy, quality nstruction.It is perfect top for work and date night I would never wear it as a dress as it is too short).The dress is very beautiful.Very thick quality the overall fit was great and as expected.This is a beautiful dress if you want a show stopperStill looks great though.Please remember that the stuffing is NOT included, which is fine and is listed in the description; I'm pointing it out for those who overlooked that.Not for water, more as a cute novelty.It is a an attractive ring, but not as brilliant as described in previous reviews......wouldn't fool anyone even at a distance...This is a lovely sweater and I gave it to my husband for his birthday.ComfyI was pleasantly surprised that these are slightly decent quality.I got them to spruce up photo shots I'm taking

light, or just light effects.inexpensive and fun.Very light and stylish.Its soft and plush like a teddy bear.My arch was too high on top to wear but well made and I love the brandGreat buy and it worked perfect for what I needed it for.I'm giving this four stars, because the box was a little damaged, nothing outrageous but I think that maybe a little bit of bubble wrap would make a difference.Nice socksComfortable Cutecheaper material than I thought, but they fit wellthe design is printed on and the fabric is thin but it is worth the price.It's lightweight material best for summer swimming.Made in Pakistan, thin material, but perfect for seasonal wear.Good fit and vers well to keep you dry.nice for the price thanksThe product is great, I have a citizen watch and if it is mpletely drained and I want to wear it on a cloudy day a have a problem.Plastic uld be made better.Priced high but nice productMakes it lood dressy.My plan was to train with the added weight and try to drop to my old PB WITH the weight, then run without the weight on race days.A slightly more detailed analysis of that follows..lbs may not sound like much, but after a few hundred stairs, you absolutely feel it.It's amazing how much lighter and more explosive you feel when you do the same activities without the weight that you'd been doing to train with the weight.The shirt alone can make you a little top heavy, although that may be exactly what you're looking for to enhance your workout.I trail/stair run in both of these products, and the weights do not bounce or take on a life of their own.While the shirt system has an extra mpression shirt that helps keep the weights secure, I just wear normal workout shorts over the Titin shorts, and it feels just fine.The shorts have a belt mechanism up top to keep them from falling down, and it actually worked surprisingly well.That's in part just the price you pay for the weights being held so securely in place.The weights themselves are also not particularly washable, and trust me, they are going to get quite sweaty.The gels are ated in some kind of lycra-like fabric, and I've yet to find a really effective way to clean them.They are not spun from spider silk or designed by Jony Ive.The quality is fine, but still, the price point is perhaps a bit high for most people.This hat is HUGE, but good qualityThe fabric is beautiful, the medium was too small through the bust line and shoulder.I used to wear these to walk/workout/light running back in the s when these first came out, and they were/are extremely mfortable and provide a stable support system to the foot.Not for heavy-duty running or jogging, but just fine for general wear and working out weight training, etc.).It's super soft, and great quality.Love the fabricGreat outfit especially for price.Heel and arch are super mfortable.Not as mfortable as some other heels I have in that aspect but hoping I just need to break them in a bit.Bullko Men's Retro Pin Buckle Genuine Leather Belt I like the belt.It can be squeaky when moving while sitting around but that's what leather does.It's can be casual or dressy.But you absolutely need a high waisted belt to wear with it.Just a Nice clean hat....looks great and good materialFor my purposes it's excellent.Lovely bracelet.Very sparkly.A bit more rigid than I would have liked but I understand that it's what makes it less likely to break.I love this shirt, the material is SO soft.decent quality for the price.I love these leggingsThey are so mfy buttery softThese are very appealing and pretty.I rated stars because the glasses were of good quality, and were what I expected based on videos and pictures I viewed prior to purchase.I looks great though.Very soft and mfy.Best used in an air nditioned or ol environment.Fabric doesn't breath at all.If you are looking for a good looking hat to go with your stume, and don't mind that it arrives flattened, this is a good deal.The hat look good and the price is right.But the footbed is the same as several others that I get and works wonders for high arches.Love the shoe.The quality was good for a stume but that's all it was--stume quality.The material is soft and the lor is bright.This outfit is very cute, especially if your child loves tutus.mfortable, nvenient and classic.Def a good at.I will have to see how long it lasts but so far so good.great fabricThe dress though is beautiful.Perfect for everyday use.Super mfortable.Fabric is not see through, but has a very low back, so not appropriate for your typical bra.I do enjoy the fabric, I like how thin it is.Otherwise good quality and warm.Its a very well made bag, good quality in the materials and the finish, mi wife like very much.I've been looking for something like this that wasn't to expensive and good quality and this was it for sure.I love these leggings.They're polyester, so don't expect to be able to wear them during ld weather.However, they're pretty, they're mfortable, and worth it for the price.good product.I got this for the hemline feature.It's a great turtleneck and it's soft.The item arrived quickly and in great ndition.I liked the realistic look, and it's easy to clean.It price was great and perfect for what I needed it for.Great stume wig.Not very realistic but I've used it for halloweens now, fun product.I just love the design and the fabric.Its very light cloth excellent when the summer hits.Nice an light.A little aggressive cleat for turf but does the job and really enjoyed playing in themQuality nstructionThese are very mfortable, with soft leather, nice grip and flexible solesThe little accesories on the zips keep falling off also but all in all a very girly/ princessy bagBeautiful dress excaltly like the picture, very finest but mine unfortunately had a stain on the back which I think came from the gold, but besides that it was beautiful, I love itWe live in sub zero temps and these are nice to send baby out in for the day.Not as high quality as Carter's but a good buy plus cute prints.Although still quite new the quality seems reasonable.Still giving stars because the quality was good.It was mfortable and easy to breastfeed in.I love these, but I wish they had made them stain/water resistant.These are very cute and soft.Beautiful jewel work, unique pear shaped jewels .I think it will serve much better as a summer cap to keep the sun off my face, yet not smother my head due to thick material.However, they do work well for tape and rrugated tubing.Cute, but a little cheaper made than expected.Kind of bug eyed big,,,but stylish and cute....i will.wear a few times and give away too big on my head.....but love the lor and qualityIt's thin but I was looking for a lightweight hoodie so for me it is perfect.so, I'm happy with my purchase, and the price was rightEverything is perfect, but I wish I uld remove the drawstring in the pants.Light-weight mfy shoes.Great price for the product.Comfortable and versatile.Love the material and the price is niceVery pretty and perfect for office.The material is not great at washing though.It is attractive and functional.Seems well nstructed and sturdy.Been using the bag now for about months and only downside I have noticed is the material it is made of, has not softened up yet.This peack charm necklace is lovely; the lors are nice.Wish they made this in ttonThey're mfy and cute, I would definitely buy them againGreat for price.great for the priceJust my size and good fabric.Very lorful gems.Nice looking piece overall for the money.Nothing super fancy, and so far holds up great.The zippers and pulls are strong and it seems to be well made.I reinforced the stitch and no problems.Excellent quality, sturdy, very large brim and crown.A very ol shirt to wear when you go out anywhereOverall, good for the price.nice product, well delivered.Cool hat, it keeps the sun off my face and neck like I was hoping.I'm hoping it will stretch out or I may get a haircut.**update** after wearing in times it is stretching out and fits much better.It was form fitting but very mfortable and glad that it had some spandex in the material.It's incredibly warm which is exactly what I was looking for.It is lovely but needs much better directions.Matches my gown perfectly, and a good thing that I sew or I would have no idea what to do with the two pieces.Its very pretty and made of nice, soft material.It clung to my body more than I expected.great beltI loved the look of this dress in the pictures.I'm having to get it tailored quite a bit though.but I was very happy with the quality and the design.once it is done, it will be gorgeousImpressive engineering design, for sure, to assure leak-proof function and for easy fill up with wide mouth.The chain is not the best quality, but the pendant is what's important.The glowing blue heart is the olest part.Overall, it's a neat little pendant that most Zelda fans will like.This is a very beautiful piece of jewelry.I mplaint and if I wear my at hood as well, then I am zy.These socks were great fitting, and very warm.We don't get bad winters here in NC, so when my daughter needed boots, she wore her rain boots with these for extra warmth.It's very cute and mfy.It's not quite as long as the picture makes it appear, but it's still really nice.I bought it for work and it has great stretch to it and looked cute with wedges.Nice skirt for work or play.Great socks, fit well, great priceThe only issue I had with it was that I wish it were made of a softer material.It is a very nice at, a few mplaints though.My other mplaint is the quality.It was easily fixed but still for the price I wish I didn't have to.It's warm.I love the removable hood.But it's not advertised to be rainproof, so I cannot mplain too much.My wife sewed it right up, and it hasn't been a problem since.That being said, I like the jacket enough that I may just invest the time to wax it myself.Love the print on this dress and the fabric is soft and not see through.Its perfect for summer.The arm openings are a little big but I plan on getting a pretty lace strapless bra that will look okay if a bit shows.Very cute top; easy care too.I was looking for things that would make traveling easier.This product shows how to fold items on a plastic board that fits nicely into a pocket.I tried a few items and they held up well.If I do not have to iron, I will definitely bring more dressy" blouses.This is also great when my husband travels and needs to take his dress shirts.It has survived pool water, ocean water, and the daily grooming process soap, lotions, etc) without me having to take it off.These shoes were great, and my son loves themMake my feet sweat for some reason...not very breathable, but very mfortable and good quality.Cute in the picture but in real life the pattern reminds me of prison clothes stars since fit and quality are decent.The shirt was a little more than I wanted to spend.But the shirt quality is good.The letters are paint not embroidery.Great bag, high quality materials and nstruction, looks exactly like the picture.Also, the strap is on the thin side, but I've gotten nothing but mpliments for it.But otherwise, I love itUnfortunately I had to return it ( Quality is great.Heavy material intricate design looks a lot more expensive that what was paid.I wonder if these dresses have small minute flaws and are sold for a cheaper price to other sellers.Otherwise the style and lor were perfect for her.The clasps look like they uld fall off with some heavy wind, but if you belt it with a nice belt and maybe attach new clasps I think it would be great for a baby shower or something similar.After first wash in a gentle machine and air drying, one pair had a uple of threads me loose, but the rest are fine so far.It's pretty mfortable, too.The lace detail is so pretty.very mfortable.well made.sweet.very warm and light Few strings

able to layer underneath it like I wanted to.It is a great product and works perfectly for most tables.Nice quality material.It was prop that was pretty easy to carry around.The straps me off from

Samurai brand first for two weeks to get my arches acquainted, and then switched to this brand, and have kept them on my sneakers ever since.Great support.It seemed a bit bigger in the picture but over all great back packThe material was really nice, a sort of heavy fabric.not wow' effect, but I cannot say it's low quality sleeves are long enough for cm height but not super-long it hides your fifth point and looks pretty stylishThese are so mfy and look great under long tank tops and/or short dresses.It's good but not extremely soft"Looks goodVery cute and soft.Love this bag, just wish

knots.I wasn't sure what to expect for the quality of this item since it was so cheap, but it's really great, warm, and mfortable to wear.But it still looks great and has a really vibrant kind of watermelon lor.The leather is very still making ut a bit unweildy, but I'm sure it'll loosen up with use.Excellent leather very soft.With extra storage under the side for receipts.Great value for the moneyThis looks exactly like the pictureGreat hat, lots of sun procreation, feels sturdy, love it.Great product for great price.it is good quality for what it isIt's one of my favoritesGreat, mfy shirtCrisp, lightweight, breathable fabric that washes and dries with minimal wrinkling.It is a soft leather and for the price I am amazed at how nice it is.Clips hold reasonably well and patterns are

expensive and I feel less nervous when I wear my cheap jewelry because, if it gets lost, I am not out much money.So when I do casual or active things, I throw on stume jewelry.This necklace was already mplimented at a grocery store by a mplete stranger.I gave it stars not because it is super high quality but because it is better quality than expected for the very low price.They work great on wet surfaces.After going through several plastic resin" bands that usually crack and break within a year, I have found this band to be very mfortable and durable so far).I added a small black rubber o-ring that I uld position where I needed it, and it blends in nicely with the watch.Does a great job of keeping everything in place.The clock still works and otherwise very cute piece.Looks nice but the elastic slips off easily.Really a great stype bag.There are lots of card holders and just perfect room.The polka dot effect.So yes, good price good quality and accurate fit.Good Quality for the price.This hat is great for keeping the sun off my face and shoulders on the beach.Depending on the position of the sun it can almost shade both shoulders.My only mplaint is the hat is easily pushed up and/or away in higher wind.Other than the wind issue, the hat is great and is exactly what I was looking for.( bigger than a half dollar) Good quality though.Bought this watch with a wood faced watch from another more expensive) brand.Interior wood grain is very nice with the hands and dials mpleting a clean look.Everything else looks fine./ Quality: Great quality materials; better than the more expensive watch I bought with it.Thick black leather straps, seemingly strong crystal, and detailed dial pieces.It's very whimsical and she will feel like a princessIt is as described, it is modern and elegant at once.The material is soft, it will require hand washing to last.I liked how it feels sexy with the open design of the front.These are good quality but I felt like they don't hold up well.Didn't realize it was a very light fabric, looks see-through, but my mom tried it on with nothing underneath except a bra) and it wasn't visible, so that was good to hear.Fun top but the fabric around the snaps is a little scratchy.These glasses are nice and stylish, and flattering to the face.They are reasonably sturdy and well made.My only mment is that the reading part of the lens mes up quite high, so there is about a / split between the reading portion and the plano.This is fine when you are reading, but it's not as easy to walk around in.Also nice stretch fabric and real lace, good length too.Great leggings, will buy again.Seems very sturdy and is team neutral so it be used anywhere.Beautiful gown.Picture does it no justice, its so much prettier in person.Necklace is very cute on and not heavy.I expected it to be tighter but is very mfortable.verry vibrant nice qualityDefinitely worth it to break them in and get used to the height.The boots feel well made and like they would last for a while, so I am not mplaining there )Great shirt and so cute.Good shirt for the priceVery mfortable skirtIt looks exactly like it does in the picture.It's super long on me I'm ') and I had to have my mom hem it, but once she did that I've been wearing it during the warmer months of the summerBut mfyDefinitely all-tton, with the pattern woven in.Has some kind of sizing in the fabric that has a pretty potent stink when new, but a uple of ld-water hand washes with Woolite takes care of that.My daughters are big into band and music and they absolutely love their new leggingsNice material, cute pattern, and a flattering fit.Glad it has a strap to keep it on my head for wind.She said they are made for fairly tall people, and were a bit on the thin side, but that aside are wonderful.Keeps legs warm for winter wear.The fabric isn't that nice.I would only note that the adhesive may sometimes get a little sticky to the skin, but overall good product.Hat is stiff and looks good.I would like it if the screening blocked a little more of the sunlight.I love my skirtThe quality was better than I expected, though I do wish it had pockets.Had to iron the packing creases out but if you take it out of a low dryer immediately upon mpletion of the dry cycle, you can easily just hang and wear with no ironing necessary.What a handy item and a lifesaver if you ever work on watchbands.Still nice and very stretchy.The mpression was gentle enough to not hurt after surgery but firm enough to pull everything together.I have not washed it yet so I cannot mment on the durability of the fabric, but it looks good and fits exactly as it should.This is a beautiful bag.Soft, mfortable to carry.Well made, zippers are good quality metal, stitching is nice, attractive and looks like it will hold up indefinitely.I believe this is is a mbination of leather and a man made leather material.It is beautiful in any case.I'm not a fan of smocked waist dresses but this one fits nicely.It is a nice length I'm '") I bought it to wear to a high school reunion.OTHERWISE I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.It is a very nice quality for a great price.All in all, it's a great mb.Fits great supper fun for Halloween they were just what I was looking forThis vest is solid for the price.This was a really nice piece for the inexpensive price.good quality but runs a little smallCute pajamas at a good price.Also, while they do have buttons on one side, which can make it easier putting the pants on, or taking them off, a send set of buttons on the other side would have made them perfect.Haven't used it yet, but I'm loving the styleIt was very pretty and made a nice gift for my niece, it is a little bulky but other than that it has a sparkly faux diamond that looks real.The chain was durable and long enough.This was a nice productI like it, but it came with scented freshness pack in it that smelled of flowers.I bought this in addition to my skull earrings and other skull accessories.The material is good and I love the frontShirts is ok but material is not what I expected.Really cute bracelet, love how the silver looks on my skin and very easy to put on.Hides imperctions flattering to curvy bodies.I does look like the picture, I don't like to much the fabric but the dress is nice and wearable.I do love it still as it helps my stomach to appear much flatter and I have already gotten a few mplements on my weight loss."The material stretches very well and allows one to bend over and sit down mfortably.My only mplaint is that the skirt part is a bit short for my liking, so I usually pair it with leggings.Well made design.Had a few stray strings on the seams, nothing a quick flame uldn't remedy though.It was great my child love themHowever after wearing them around the house for a few days, then using them for practice and playing a tournament, they were really mfortable and provided very good support and traction.My feet felt fine they day after the all day tournament so these shoes definitely protected my feet.Great traction as well.Bean boat shoes.I had previously picked up a few pairs of Gold-Toe no-show socks from a local department store.Perches a little high on my head, but the yellow/tan lor is very nice and the styling is great.Bras are very mfortable.Very nice but no sealing glue included.Silver applique might not last long, it seems to rub off on us when we hold him, but it nice and fits well.They are a tad baggy and a bit long but my waist fits great and they are very mfortable and my wife says they look great on me.Easy and stylishOk for the price, not much detailFor the price these things are pretty sweet.They're extremely mfortable and look great.Love the flow of the material as well as the fabrication, My only issue is, I should have ordered a size down.....The fabric is more rayon-like than linen-like.Overall, a nice peasant-type dress for bohemian chicks.They are super warm and mfy.Great for my POPCORN halloween stumeCute bracelets.The purse feels lovely, as though it were expensive leather.It is nice, but not exceptional.Goes well with maxi skirts and slacks.In the right lighting, it's basically see-thru.it was great, but it sheds a lot.It is very soft and mfortable.nothing special but it works and seems to be made of quality material for the price.if i paid more i am not sure i would be very happy but at this price point i am happy i went with this over the cases listed at even cheaper prices.Price is hard to beat, too.Still a great buy for the priceA little annoying because I have to pay attention but they are so cute and mfy, it balances out.Its a thin dress but seeing as it was needed in Florida durring warms months I am thankful for thatNice pjs for the priceCute and inexpensive.The Embroidery is as shown and good quality.I'm pleased with this item.Color as photo, soft material, but it had many loose threads off the package.The quality seems ok with the exception of the zipper.Great for the price and I have no other mplaintsGreat moisture-wicking action and very mfortable.Other than that everything was great.These were wonderful during my pregnancy and if I skipped a day wearing them I felt more tired and my legs looked worse too ( only mplaint is that they were warm and so I sweat more in them.The nstruction seems good; I'll know more after a few washes.Fabric feels good.Granted it is not loose like the model, but I can wear it.Plus the quality of the material is very good.Worth the great price I paid.The price point is very attractive as wellGreat for my son but had to get a since he's growingI would say over the years, the quality seems to have declined ever so slightly while the price has gone up, but I suppose I still find them good enough to keep buying them.The belt work great.Nothing wrong with the belt, which is what I bought.They included a Snap Belt loop with key ring.Great to wear to the holiday partyI think the necklace is nice, however the chain is a bright gold which I don't really like that much.Fabric is very light.Not forgiving for bumps.I love love love this shirtI am giving this only stars because

picture...Cute tankini.Great rain and wind protectionMy blue jacket looks beautiful.Adds/retains some warmth on ld days.Made of very thin material, which does not seem to breathe very well just be mindful of your layers and add/remove to mbat sweat buildup).Very happy with hood and it's adjustability.I'd have ordered S if available, but the largish M offers space for a fleece and a down jacket underneath without mpromising good looks I'm ' , thin).The shirt is adorable and very mfortable.The shorts are a little long, but still very mfortable.It is not very sturdy or flashy.It looks nice but it is basic build.Nothing flashy about it.I really love this necklace and you can't beat the price for what you get.Cute earrings.It has removable pads that provide a generous amount of push up".I

mfortableThe light uld be more powerful.It barely reached to the end of the sword but hey...it's still fun nonethelessCotton blend.Quality of any shirt you would find in a department store.As other reviewers have stated, the lor of the stone is a little disappointing, but overall I think it is a great value and I expect my daughter will love itMid range quality, but snazzy design.excellent product, I remmend it, it is good quality and it is observed that is orginal.I loved it and I chock fineThis sweater fits nicely but I have to take it to the cleaners to have button holes made in it so I can button two of the buttons.So I will have to pay extra to have this done by my cleaners....it's just more nvenient than to deal with returning it.I thought maybe it uld be a little heavy leather though but all in all I love the jacket.This shirt is really stunning in person.After I washed it though it didn't fit him as well.It hides any thick areas that you would want to hide and the material is very stretchy and soft.However, I can say that this bag held everything I needed to carry with me on day trips from the place we were staying, and also it was great for air travel.fabric is fairly slippery, and so wearing it on just one shoulder doesn't feel secure at all.It is VERY hugging, so problem areas will be prominent in this shirt.I've had my nose done for along time but haven't had any nose rings.I've never had plastic nose rings before but they seem to be just as good as the metal ones.Doesn't look cheap and seems to be well made.The shirt looks good and feels good wearing it.It has a modern yet 's vibe which seems to be the preferred trend in fashion lately.The material is good quality and you can't beat the price.Very mfortable and well made.Happy with the quality.Heavy and zy material.They are great for protecting the bunion from rubbing on your shoe.They are also very mfortable.This dress had a little stretch to it so the material hugged my body very nicely, and the lor was fantasticVery Pretty, really Happy with my purchase.Now they're perfectLove the style of this blouse.nice mfy shirtComfortable, stays put and doesn't move around.This top washes and wears well and the brown was a good, usable lor not easily found in stores.I've nvinced myself that this style should be worn loose; not flowy.The neck area has ample opening.i like lace.Otherwise love the shirtThe first night I wore these it was wet and rainy, but with the rugged sole I was able to walk just fine without slipping or sliding.Thicker and heavier than other bamboo scarves I have purchased.I'm more used to bamboo being a light airy fabric choice.Excellent item.The only problem was that the button hold was sewed in but never cut out for button.Had to wear them all day before they had some give.I did have to move it up as well as weave it through the top sides of the swimsuit a little to make sure everything stayed in place.It is high quality material and entirely worth the price for just the top.It's extremely cute and mfortable.I love that the entire garment, including the elastic is tton as far as I can tell).The quality of the fabric is satisfactory.It's good material and is soft, but I wished it came when it was suppose too.shirt made a nice wall deration but was too smallOtherwise the tie seems decent quality for a few wears.Surprisingly sturdy and strong.Amazingly affordable nsidering they are polarized which is a huge perk.Beautiful shoes.A few Stones were not in place.The quality of the tton is outstanding.It seems to be well made, and it's more mfortable than most shirts I own.The feel of the tton is excellent.I adore this set.. it is stunning and it got a lot of mplimentsBut overall, very awesome shirt for a great priceWish they had a lining across the chest, but I'd still wear this during the summer.Not as heavy weight material as I expected, but they look good and fit well.I wish it vered a little further down from my underboob.I loved this necklace I have several Bohemian maxi dresses they will make a great extra to the outfits.This is VERY mfortable and warm.Cute and mfyThis swim suit is good quality fabric.I'm a DD and the top was splurging a little bit is still wearable and not too PG-, if you catch my drift.the material is really soft.Soft material, holds equip in place.ol shirt Love it but it isn't as sheer and light weight as I thought it would be.Good winter scarf, won't work for spring or summer.Overall very good bag and I would remmend it.They are awesome for the price, look good and feel good.The only thing is they just feel like they will break easy but my intentions when buying these weren't for a long lasting pair.I expected the quality to be minimal because of the price, but it is beautiful.These are very nicely made shorts of good quality, but they run very small.Bought the month size and our month old was able to wear it.excellent piece, but just see through enough that I wear a tight spaghetti strap top under it.Very hot design, washes well and dries sans wrinkles.The material is what I expected, a light tton material.Nice width and pattern, but would be even better if it were a matte finish and more flexible.The shoulders were not as structured as I would have liked, but the robe is very mfortable.You can see straight through itNice accessory actually mfortable, and the price was very affordable.wish poly was at % or more.Not as soft as I expect a fleece gown to be on the inside of it.It's beautiful, functional, and sturdyI was hoping it would be a bit higher quality.It's mfortable and warm.They work just fine for my exercising purposes.He wore these outside for about hours on a degree day; they kept him mfortably warm without being so heavy as to cause overheating.It fits great and it is very mfortable, but the material does get a bit warm for the summer.Love this swim diaper, but I wish the snaps were on both sides instead of just one.But, these are so much better for the environment and CUTER than disposable swim diapers so we'll happily buy the next size up.But this is simply amazing.The front flows nicely.The quality of the material is average and seems to be nsistent with most clothing now a days, a bit thinner material.by far my favorite choker cute for the summerOther than that, A+ material great verageThere was also a pretty big hole on the ride side seam, but overall happy with the dress.Comfy fit.Looks really good.It is adequate for my needs.The purse is very quality but its not the big size tote, i was expected to be.Cute, but the lace is rather long and one sock had a small hole in it but was easily fixed).great for the minimalist thoLove the fleece lining.I am a waist, I ordered a " and it fitted well with two holes to spare for blow outs.Its cute, but there isn't any underwire for support.They are great and cuddly warm.Really great quality.No tears or loose strings.Package arrived in a timely

the BahamasCute top, flattering and mfortable.I wish the neckline was a finished seam rather than an unfinished fold-in because it takes some doing to get the neckline to lay right/look right.The suit has good structure and real underwire and padding which provides great support.I wouldn't do jumping jacks well, maybe if I tied the top very firmly and I went slow...) but for schlepping along after my kid should be fine.I chose this because I am tired of the extra fabric on the skirted ones taking so long to dry.But, ol nonetheless.The stume arrived quickly and well packaged.Beautiful, and I

really cute can't wait to wear it.VERY WARM on the mountain under my ski pants.The plastic wrap that this was in was like that of a big Ziploc bag, with the sealing zipper at the top I thought that was pretty nice.I hand washed the shirt and let it surf dry overnight.It was not sheer at all and the fabric is better than I thought it would be.Great looking light saber.The latch broke pretty easily and the switch sometimes is not easy to find, but for the price, this is the perfect playtime kylo ren saber.The side pieces do NOT light up.Excellent productBeautyI love this braceletIt's

the material.They are a lovely honey lor and I'm keeping them because they were a good price and I can figure out a place to use them.:-( Other than that it was a great idea and quality.These workout

bracelet.It is highly fashion forward and looks great.Well-built and good-looking.Wish the pockets for holding stuff were a little bit more spacious.but still a ol item.Cute, but did not stay close under my breast.Very beautiful onTook forever to get but nice .almost worth the waitthe flower lining is a perfect add on.The arm holes are a bit tight, but over time I guess the garter will give to a more mfortable stateGreat head piece for the price.Be prepared to have to adjust a lot to get it the mesh where you want it.great sandal and pretty, but not as mfy as my skeecher sandalsNice looking belt, love how it works.Just a bit loose on me...overall, I love itIt's still a good quality tank, but the fabric is thin so keep in mind that it will stretch over time.Great to wear around at parties

must tell you that the disunt is what originally tempted me to purchase this necklace but the quality is what made me fall in love with it.This necklace is perfect for me.Looked good, though the image wasn't as sharp as I'd hoped.Great shirt I love the logo.Great item at a great price.Soft and very lightweight, perfect for the summer.Love that it has pockets for my phone or other items while I'm around the house.Not amazing quality stitching, but I wasn't exactly expecting designer goods.It is a good purchase if you are not planning on wearing it everyday.Socks are nice and thick, very mfortable.I'm hope they keep me warm.More of a personal issue than a product issueIt vents really well and my head barely broke a sweat when hiking the AZ desert.Very good qualityLove the dress, but because of the white bra padding I gave it stars.Top is too sheer for the padding.Comfortable pants, lot of room to move.Good, well made.As far as a top, I purchased a peasant lace top with a sash but am still searching for other options.Happy with the productJust feels like a high quality shirt.Nice quality heavily ribbed neck and arm bands are mfortable and snug up lightly to my very average biceps; not tight at all yet miles away from flapping in the breeze like a cheap tshirt.Great shirt at a great price.Nice fitting with a taper cut and the arms aren't flapping in the breeze.It feels and fits more like a t-shirt that your grandparents picked up in an airport souvenir shop on their way back from their vacation in Boca.The material is a stretchy type that will stretch to your curves.Im '" with am hour glass shape and I bought an XL based off the reviews top is puffy than I would likeThe amount of jewelry that mes in this is amazingTge metal seems to be made of great material and I would buy againfunky set but not the best quality.The bracelet is very nice but I thought it might be adjustable and it's not.Quality seems nice.Looks good and washes well.These earrings are just what I needed to mplete my rose gold ensemble.These are so mfortable.Logo started to fall off after a few washings but the sweatshirt and zipper are very well made.Nice heavy material.It seems to be very warm and we'll made.Very mfortable I would highly remmend to anyone.The lors are bright but not cheesey, the material is better than I expected, and the fit was great.Roomy, mfortable, warm, and snuggly:( It's a little disappointing as the product is very warm and I would like for it to help keep my ankles warm as well.Because the bottom of the legs is banded and it rides up it's not the most mfortable, and it also makes it hard to find good long socks for verage if wearing it with shoes/slippers.The fabric was so soft and mfortable.nice average shoe, only mplaint is tongue of shoe sticks way up, but nice shoe for the price and my son likes themI'm not a fan of the fabric, but the fit is amazing.It is a gift but liked it and the packagingThe velvet on the stume keeps you warmClassy looking.Love the material and length Comfortable and stylishWhen I put them on you uld hear threads breaking so I am wondering how long they will last, but they look and feel good.This is very pretty, soft, and has a key ring to hang keys off of it too.They are ok. Not crazy about the material.Not as stretchy or soft as I would like, but stretchy enough.Comfy in the summer though.Very nice sturdy weekend back.Great to minimize overpacking )This dress is quite mfortable and I get lots of mplements when I wear it.The neck is a little too low for my taste but it was easily altered without being obvious.They're perfect for what I needed them for ).Appears good quality.Covers my whole torso and it's a pretty good waist trainer because after a few days I'm already on the send row of hooksThe material is also very nice.It is really flattering and it made my breast look nice.Awesome gloves nowhere near as stiff as I would have guessed they really fit and where almost like a normal pair of glovesVery nice dress, good quality.It is definitely not the quality they are.Nice quality Koi top, but pockets are too small for me and won't fit my iphone s plus without the phone falling out when I sit down.But again, they're fine for just trying to be mfortable if I'm home.Well-made, sturdy socks.I have a lot of Citizens and other high end denim.More of an hour glass figure, but petite, the high waist is perfect for me mfortable.Not as much stretch" as my hudsons, jbrands, s or other citizens, but these are nice and sexy and hold their shape.The lor is perfect for casual or dressing up, crop length is perfect and modern.Great for a date night or fun brunch with heels or wedges can also pair with flats or flip flops for more casual days.Attractive and well madeCute sweaterThe quality and look of the product is awesome stars for that but the sizing is off.Looks good The fabric is luxurious feeling.The material uld be nicer and the cuts uld be cleaner but for the price it makes sense.It's so sparkly.Great looking and durable kilt.The material is very mfortable and has nice stretch to it.Very mfortable with a tank top underneath.The opal looks exactly like the picture, maybe even more beautifulA great classic look for my kid.Look much more expensive than they actually are and have held up well so far.The design is beautiful and well made.We are not rough with the necklaces...there is truly a weak link in this otherwise beautiful design.It's very mfortable and stretchy and I'm very picky about sleeping in lace.True to size and soft and mfy, my son loved it.Lovely soft material and I like the style.Material has a good weight to it.The material was better than I expected and the little bear was definitely a plus.The fabric is great.It's pretty good for dollarsNot as exctied about the stiffness of the lace but great value for the priceThe fabric is also that slick/shiny style, so these are more for fashion than mfy cuddle leggings, but they're still mfortable.The at is very warm which is important as I live in Chicago where we can get temperatures that are very low at times.Very cute and well made for the price.The fabric is a stretchy tton blend material.It was hot, I was wearing a tank top and had to buy a scarf to use as a shawl so I uld visit some churches in Rome and this would have been perfectVery good deal... good quality for the money.It is such a pretty set.Both my parents were floored by how custom it lookedI'll definitely have to figure out a remedy for that before spending a night in it at prom maybe a full lining of softer material.So you have to be up for a bargain with the neckline and the backNICE FOR THE PRICETotally all lace, no nd layer to hide the goodies.And how lace is positioned across breast, that lace does nothing to hide the the goodies, no matter your skin lor.A beautiful wallet, but I wish It uld hold more.Love the zip feature.Good number of sections.Very nice and well-made for the price.Great swim trunksI'm using it to wear under see thru dresses it will work for that purpose.I love the fact I can carry a lot of items in it.I've used it every day for about months now, and it still looks new.The straps do seem a bit wimpy to me, but have held up well.The hardware nnecting the straps to the bag are very sturdy.Came in great ndition and worked well, however, don't carry too much in it or the strap will breakmfyI'm not sure if this is intentional but in all fairness it's probably due to the image being stretched.The tank is super soft and light but the print feels rough to the touch.thin material as is the more lorful variation, decent quality.Again super cute at, I will end up giving it away to someone that will truly be able to enjoy it.It vers my butt but just barley, I'll be rocking it on weekends but definitely not work appropriate.Really good quality fabric.Well, for me personally these bras will not work if you are a larger D cup prior to pregnancy they probably won't fit you either) but for the price I thought the quality was good and the material felt alright.These are wonderfully soft and adorable.This wallet is good I like the material what it make from it fit just right in my back pocket so smooth.Looks fragile, and I'm guessing machine-washing wouldn't be a great idea.Altogether a good product.I bought numerous bags for work before this one and this one works perfect for my needs.I wanted a sturdy bag that wasn't heavy since I have neck and back problems and this is perfect.it has enough room to carry books and loring books without them getting bent or damaged.Surprised by some shiny fibers in the mix, but attractive and warm.Great valueIts warm enough for fall and warmer winter days but lightweight enough to keep on all day.LovelyAnd they had great traction on our tile floors.Beautiful Clutch.Other than that, it's very beautiful and looks richer than it is.Great quality, I wear this everyday and I immediately noticed a charge of a little more energy with this ld nasty weather I'm from Chicagoland in Illinois).The energy flow is great and I would wear it wrapped as a bracelet if I didn't want to wear as a necklace.Inside the seams are well stiched.These pants were a nice cut and would be fairly mfy if they weren't so tight in the hips.But the zipper is great, and the pull strings on the sides make it a more custom fit.Nice looking tie, I get lots of mpliments.Quality of material is good and mfortable to wear.Great looking top.Haunt washed yet but past purchases kept lor.Husband loved these, soft and very mfortable.My husband love this jacket, a little disappointed because one of the button came loose as soon as he tried it on but overall GreatLove these jeans so mfortable and they arrived earlyI'm happy I purchased it thoughExactly as pictured...material is stretchy but thin and kind of shiny like stume clothing but I plan to sew a layer of black lace over both and it'll be greatSeems very sturdy and well made.Send, the llar on the Dillards shirt is the same material as the shirt, which is a smooth soft tton.This shirt did have a smooth llar but not as smooth and it was ribbed.I think for the price I'm happy but in the future may just spend the extra and get the highest quality Ralph Lauren Polo possible.Maybe this was a previous years design, regardless I'm happy with the product I have received it is legitimate, high quality and fits well.Nice tank tops.Quality and lor is great.I love the fabric, perfect for summer days and for beach parties.Beautiful skirt, very flattering fit.Material: This % Polyurethane bag is ideal in the fact it is waterproof, washable, flexible, and lightweight.It is also a cheaper, lower maintenance alternative to leather.The % tton interior also is beneficial so if you have product leakage it is possible to clean it.It is an attractive, affordable bag with a name brand look.The simple design and loring gives it a timeless appearance.The interior has gold accents, which make it unique in its kind.good quality for the price, very similar weight and feel to original.I love the feel of the fabric and very mfortable.Heavier fabric than I saw from the reviews.Quality of these gloves feels great.I haven't used them yet in the ld but I think they will keep my hands warm skiing.There isn't a little dot of nonstick for the most sensitive areas like I have had in previous stick-ons.I just add a tiny dab of shea butter to prevent stick and irritation in those areas.nice topMetal garter clips would get it stars.Would be great for date-night under a dress if it would stay clipped.Very nice quality.Material was a little different from what I expected.I really like this nursing bra, it gives a nice shape and is enough support I can wear under day clothes out of the house.But for the price I like it, and it is very mfortable.A little expensive but very handy.The tubes are well made and sturdy.Product arrived in good shapeHowever, it looks like it would be easy to repair if necessary.* I wish they'd made the front mpartment with a zipper as well to secure the ntents better.It actually looks better this way but people should still know what they are getting.My favorite socks.The fabric and pattern are great.Don't mind the tan lines...bought this suit to work on that.These were high-quality shoes, but were on the large side.They are and look exactly like what is described.No chest support what so ever, So be aware of that before you buy it but other than that it is a beautiful summer dress and I love itI LOVE handbagsGood ProductGreat quality but ran bigThe band isn't great quality, but that can be replaced if someone really wants a different band.Very pretty bootsIt is perfect for tucking that extra skin" from having a child.Excellent value for moneyWish the clasp was better quality.great valueIts looks exactly like the product pictures.Great, especially for the price.this is not exactly as pictured but very pretty nonetheless.I love the detail and the examples.The inside lining is not very appealing but the outside is super nice.The quality is super and I really like it.great jean, just too long, they are more for a taller person, I'm ' they were way too long on me, but mfortable.Stylish AND great functionality.Perhaps it will get more flexible with use.Happy with this productOnly reason I'm giving a is because I am not letting him out on until school begins, so I can't say its mfortable for my child.I have numerous pieces from Sunsets Swimsuits and I really love the brand.Very pretty diamonds, look great.Very good productGood gualityWhile it's not what I wanted it is very cute and a nice quality fabric despite the shrink factor.REAL review for real buyers like myself, just looking to get the best quality at the best price.:-( Also the skirt was made for like an Amazonian woman evem woth ." heels.Overall they make my legs looks so long I don't think you will find anything better.Epically these types of shoes for a fitness npetition.Nice quality hat.Much better quality than I expected.Great product I think it's adorable and fits me well.Great hatsIt was mfy and casual for a girls lunch date.its cute, nice material, looks just like the picture, im ' lbs fit me perfectly.Great jacket, bought it off season, so have not used it yet...Thicker than I was expecting but great quality.cape at is very nice and pairs well with a lot of outfits.Shiny adjustable I am happy with this purchase.It is a beautiful ring I suggest if you have long fingers it will work wellThey are really cute with bright lights.It was pretty well made and mfortable.I can't speak to durability or any mparison to the real" product that this is based on.Ended up giving this hat to my landscaper, as he liked the look and uld make better use of it.I'm hoping after I wash it enough times it'll soften.If the material had been softer, I would've given it stars.The at looks real nice and good quality.Beautiful dress for the priceI prefer to hang dry and lightly iron for the best wear and flow of the materialI love this gown and wear it most nights.Was inexpensive and a good buy.good shirt, good priceNecklace is so beautiful I love itSuper cute, feels amazing on, its very silky smooth and feminine.They seem to be mfortable and and are pretty easy to slip on and off.In both pair there was a spec of black al) which for the money the clarity was surprising stunning.It looked better with the pencil skirt.I really loved this item.Beautiful ring but more for special occasions.Bought this for my wife who is pregnant with triplets, the material is soft and stretchy.They were made of good quality rubber and fit as stated.The earrings are very lovely.Breath nice, don't stay damp long after being wet, give good support.Just enough to keep the ntours of the cheeks.I used a steamer to get the wrinkles out, and that worked ok. Also, I didn't like the nnection above the V not sure what to call that).So I cut it off, and it looks so much better.Doing this did make the neckline a little looser, but nothing too revealing.I was pleasantly surprised by the style and quality of this sweater for the price.It a somewhat loose knit that allows the lor of the garment you're wearing underneath to show through.ok good for driving, but not very warm.I LOVE this skirt.The quality is wonderful due to the thick fabric and vibrancy of the red.Perfect for the office, night out, or even a casual day with cute flatsThe suit underneath the skirt is supportive and durable, and smooths out the tummy and back.Amazing dress for great priceGreat sunglasses and fast shippingDefinitely authentic.Lightweight oh so mfortableThe fabric is not a tton/linen but a polyester blend, which is fine, but not as advertised, which is why I gave it stars.Pretty for an I expensive pendant.Great material and dye.Good quality priceFeels and looks greatI'm pleased with the orthotic have it in my athletic shoes.I can feel the difference in walking, but I believe they would even be better in shoes with a deeper heel cup.Only drawback is they are easily wrinkled.It's an annoying process, but they are easily my favorite pants.Strong and durable to maintain your watch strap in place.Thin/ yep but still looks awesomeoverall, this is a great productGreat product for the money but watch the heals, they can roll up on you if you slide your foot in wrong.Light weight and non-skid and great for playingPros: The quality was much better than expected.These pictures were taken withou a bustle and with self-lacing, for an event you would absolutely need someone to lace you up.With careful cutting I am nfident I can clean this up.Looks good though.Otherwise, great necklace.heel is a lil offset but very mfortablethey are pretty good.Very study and well built.great shirts fit fine and good qualityThis dress is adorable onIt fits fantastic and looks great but the material that hangs down from is more see through than the picture leads on.Exactly what I was looking for.Because of that, and the design of the semi-cutout of the back, it helps give the illusion of a bigger, rounder bubble bottom.The tops love it, and love gripping the waist band strap while he does the deed.Was prettier than I thought.But i still love the item itself.Good, mfy fit.Looks brighter in person than it does on the model.Product is of quality i expected.The lors are vivid and the material seems very nice and well made.Very mfortable tank.Material is very soft, wrinkle free.Fits well, mfortable, good for lounging or sleepingThey are definitely mfortable and would be good for lounging around or working out.I didn't give a because the lor was a little lighter than I thought it was going to be but still a great shoe.Very mfortableIt's a nice pants during pregnancyVery very mfortable.Look greatgood material and design.LOVE the snapsI love the design and the cutouts on the bottoms.For the price you can't beat itGood quality for price, too big for my septum piercing though, it hangs down too low.Gorgeous lor, too clingySoft and lightweight sleep clothesGlued it to a Sunday base added feathers net.Now it looks greatVery nice well made.Very sturdy chain and pendant with great lor and clarity.This is absolutely a beautiful piece of jewelry.It is really lovely.The quality is excellent, and I do love it very muchUpdate: The birds are beautiful.But the dress is cute.I really love these crop leggings.Not sure why that happens, but it's the only flaw I have found in these otherwise fantastic leggings.I haven't worn it yet, but looking forward to it.This dress is beautiful.I Use these as loungewearCool shadesThe material is nice and I would be all over these things if there was a tall sizing available.Seems to be nice leather and holds plenty of cards but the change falls out every time you open it.Nice size but because of the change falling out I gave it stars.Perfect for my little guy...Looks n feel very classyThis is a really great dress for the price.The material is soft and almost has an athletic feeling.Overall this is an adorable little dress, very mfortable, and a great price.This was cute and mfortable as I expected.Cute and stretchy, for all purposes.When I got the necklace I put it in a gift box and send it to my mom for a gift and she said it was nice to wear it in the day because it sparklesI think it's a beautiful shirt.Great detail.I started wearing these about a week and a half after my c-section, they are far more mfortable than the binder my doctor had me in and offered support in areas the binder uld not reach.I would have liked a little more support/mpression over my stomach, but they provided great support and mfort over my incision.The lace is very pretty and it looks very sexy.It is delicate so be careful with the fabric.But they look great on.The fabrics are nice also.Perfect gift for a tweenNicely packaged as wellGreat for the price, wish it uld ship without crushing top of hat down.Otherwise it's a wonderful shirtThe pajama set fit my grandson perfectly and it arrived just when they promised in good shapeThese nose rings are the first change for me since my piercing, so keep that in mind with my review.These nose rings are a great value because they do have a flat head on the end so it won't be falling out, so that is a bonusI have very sensitive skin so was afraid they would bother me and I haven't had an issue with them at all, yeahGreat value and quality.Soft and a really good buyItem was perfect for my daughterFabric somewhat light but still a very nice shirt.Not guide as pretty as the picture, but a nice scarf regardless.Loving the light material.It makes carrying and transporting our stuff so much lighter and easier.Design is great.A lovely dress.The material is heavy, so you don't worry about being back lit, walking in the rain, or having a Marilyn moment.It's nservative enough for work, but stylish enough I'd wear it for a night out.Decent shirt, Not as lightweight and different texture than UnderArmour but would remmend for the price.The pajamas are not fitting around his shoulders well any longer after washes).Great buy i got a lot of duplicates though.Comfy pantsIt is excellent as a stume prop for the stume.Great thongs.Firm rubber no rubbing between the toes.I can still wear them mfortably and they are warm.The inside liner is VERY soft and mfy.Wears nicely and feels soft.I washed it but haven't worn it since.It is flattering and not too tight.Seemed very good as far a quality goes.Will be perfect with my tunics and long flannel shirts with cute boots for winter.I bought shorts and it's worked fineSimple, can be elegant.Style would probably work better on a somewhat younger, thinner person, even though it does fit well and is loose and mfy.Moderately well made.Fabric is a shiny gauzy material.Lighter than the linen I had hope for.Great Product.Doing intense cardio, they sometimes fold over and start to slip off, but with yoga and weight training they are greatI was looking to order the mesh waist trainer not for smetic look but, to help in keeping me right and together during tough workout sessions.I'm sure that with some more weight loss I will be able to wear it and it fit mfortably but, was disappointed I uldn't mfortably wear it now.Nice quality socks.makes my mile walks more mfortableAnd pierced it perfectly But light and cute.The lace is lovely.I washed it in ld water after letting it soak in ld water and vinegar to set the lor, as the lor is not set upon receipt.The bottom edge/train is very long, but has no hem/raw edges so we trimmed it to length.good material, its shape is a little awkward but I like it.They are warm keep my feet lower legs warm.It matched the picture and was mfy.It shows all your curves but pretty thick fabric you can't see through it especially when you wear black undergarmentsIt's very pretty I love the material it's light and soft.They are well made, soft feeling, and skin tight, they are very supportive and mfortable with a fully functional button buttonfly.The ck ring uld be a bit tighter and a little less fabric in the front rset, however it is super mfySlighy problem with clasp not staying closed.The dress is a great quality nsidering the priceThe little sparkles fall off fairly easy and it didn't me with any extras, so that's the only n.These hats were really cute, great for the sunIt's definitely NOT chiffon, as advertised.Shirt was great quality and exactly how it was shown.Great quality tooGot these for a gift seams happy with them.nice scarf at a good priceSeems like a great product but too early to tell if it really helps with healing.They are also very mfortable and give good support without being too much like the belly band the hospital gave me.Leather is amazing quality, just smell it.Ratchet system held belt tight and in place without worry.Great quality belt over all.I carefully cut the hammer loops off for a nicer look in the office.Fits a little loose on the top but very nice qualityThey're definitely mfortable but the you won't even know they're there" is a bit of an exaggerationThe earrings are heavy.Comfy to wear..washes up great.The dress is beautiful, seems well made, but I have not wore it yet, we will see in Sept when I wear it at my granddaughters wedding.Well I now wish I would have had it custom made.its small enough that i can wear it mfortably underneath clothing / as the crystal is known to lose its lor when exposed to raw sunlight.at the price of about . your really just paying for the caged crystal itself since the necklace' is nothing more than a thin black string.cage doesn't even have jump rings to help with threading so it can be worn.fortunately for me i have all the materials to make it a necklace since i craft jewelry.over all the crystal itself is lovely and price is fair for what your getting as your really just paying for a caged crystalI am happy to report I made it through the night which included dancing sitting and walking from place to place with no worries about loop breakage.material mfortable but doesn't last.Nice quality, fit as expected and true to lor in pic if not brighterIt's tight but wearable and will be fine for vacation.Other then that, it was great quality.So, the material used for this dress is amazing.It was so mfortable when I tried it on.Otherwise, great value for a cute piece.This was a very cute set with an outfit I had..Looked greatI purchased it and wore it to a metal ncert and it did a good job of wicking away my sweaty stinkiness.I already have a white gold band to match my engagement ring.It's good mfortable it's pretty thinSomewhat cheap fabric, but still nice.It's still cute and mfortable though.The material is VERY thin but for a fun top, it's O.K.Just like other reviews, some of the zippers large teeth) would get stuck, but I used the bar of soap trick and after a few back forth, they now work just fine.This is a light and very versatile bag.This is actually nice because it is not see thru at allThis item would definitely transition well from Spring to Summer, and can be dressed up or down in a variety of ways.It's very cute and flattering.The material is very soft and minimizes my waist and skims over my stomach.It's lower cut than I expected, but a cammy or safety pin fixes that.She loves it, it held up in the wash but I can see how after time the

mentioning.Material is niceReally beautiful.This has more fabric around the waist then the sails of a th century frigate This is a nice, well-made sun hat.The visse fabric is quite slinky and stretchy, more like fabric for a nightgown and not a lightweight absorbent robe to wear at the gym pool what I was aiming for).Good quality, neck area is more loose than ideal,This is my first waist trainer, and i am pretty pleased with this.Now, this will most definitely suck you in, and flatten your stomach, but I do not feel it has a very hourglass shape to this cincher.So overall, i do think this is a good trainer for the price.It's definitely chicThey are very mfortable for me.Not super high capacity but good quality.Still works, just not super smooth.Very light, mfortable and affordable.DH said it was too tight, but I thought it looked good and I got a lot of mpliments when I wore it.It did hang in my closet for a month before I wore it, so maybe it aired out.Hope it looks

better knit material.Very nice material, clearly a quality dress.Unique.Happy looks good and good qualityIt is a very nice warm cape that will go with many outfits.needs to be washed before wornGreat shoe so fargreat ring and great priceA great product thoughChain is of good quality, the only reason I did not give it stars is because the circle piece where the multiple chains hang on is not the same quality as the rest of it.Ulla Pollen for the win again.The dress arrived wrinkled, but with so many great reviews, I decided to give it a chance.However, the bras are a great price as made well and mfortableNice for the price really dark great for outdoors activities..They are UV mpliant.Comfortable shoe.A little more space between checks and register for a pen would be nice.These are very stylish dress pants.Good quality, I didn't realize this jacket is reversible so I was delighted to find I uld switch it to the red underside.If you have a beer lovers gut you may want to take that into nsideration too.Great quality btw.Obviously this is meant for funzies they've no support and you can't be all that well endowed I think they're only good for A or B cup I wear B these are

liking.nice shortsGood quality but I was unable to use the ring it came with because the ball was too tight of a fit.But otherwise greatnot a big fan of the material only because they're not warm in the winter.They are fine as expected fluffy socksIt's nice and light.These are quality material and thick enough that they aren't see through.They had s bit of an odor but I'm sure it will air out.Most yoga pants that I have bought are thicker and feel a little more supportive, which is helpful for those of us more jiggly ladies.That being said, I ordered these in the Black/grey space dye" which was a ol lor and not see through or anything, so others may be fine with the thickness level.It is pretty light nsidering all the diamonds...The leather of the belt is a nice thickness it seems like it will be durable.Easy, casual wear.Great purchase for the price.Excellent product and I love how thin and mpact it is.It seems quite durable and has a very nice finish, although it is a finger print magnet.The blazer was really nice, looked just like the advertised photo, the material was silky and felt good on the skin.The blazers material felt strong and of good quality.The wallet itself is top notch and i plan % to buy another.Very nice skirt.Zipper is a little touchy at the waist band, I think due to the thickness of the fabric.Came with all of the basic pieces needed to get the job done.Great under skirts.Perfect for a hot climate.For the price it is great.I'm -, lbs and a medium firs pretty spot on.It's no high end jersey, but for this price, it seems to be better made than I expected.The description and photo are accurate representations of the skirt.Feel great, seem to hold up to washing, wish they were longer.Stiff leather, but beautiful wallet, matches purse perfectlyOver all good quality and worth itNice causal shirtIt was perfectIt is a good fake nose ring but it would have been great if we uld have adjusted it slightly.Nice stretch.The verage is decent even without the pads.Otherwise they're great.Very pretty set, very happy with purchase.Nice heavy material and logo is quality.Well he'll grow into it;)The feel and drape of the fabric is just fine.exactly as picturedgreat looking chain.I wanted to give stars, yet I deducted a star because sometimes the links can begin to lay" the wrong way and mess up the beautiful rope pattern this chain can display.I feel the chain uld have been made with more links or clamped down to prevent them from laying" the wrong way, but you can sorta fix it by rolling the chain to get the links back into perfect alignment.Great looking Ring.Looks great and well madeThe material feels amazing.It's pretty goodThe band is a little tdelicate but the ring looks really great, especially for the price.Good basic hanky, no frills required, happy buyer.Super soft and serves the purpose.Quality merchandise.It was nice and as described but too hot for use at CoachellaLeather seems goodGood for touch extended hold timenice quality for Also pretty mfortable material.Very cute purseBut it seems well made and it's really cute.Cute as can be but very fragile It buttons around the neck which is really nvenient so the neck line doesn't stretch.The only thing I don't love about this is that I was very see through along the top.Great quality bag that is super cuteYour standard burp rag... nothing fancy, but it gets the job doneSuch a cute bagThis dress is very cute, great quality, but small in the chest area.It's really great for the price.but great fabric and styleSuper mfortable fabric, pretty stretchy, great purchaseMy only ncern is that when it shipped it was already ticking, and I am worried about the battery life.the material is Great.It's a pretty pendant.Nice looking earringsBut it's super cute and am excited to wear on my trip to Vegas to get married in a uple weeksNice and mfortable.Excellent for plantar problems.I've used these for many years and they are mfortable wearing all day.Great lor..fits perfect.You get what you pay for, so don't expect quality boning.My toddler is mfy in there and they keep his feet warm dryHave good air flow not much sweat .It is a nice sweater to have in my wardrobe.I like the material and quality...it is very pretty and the large stone sparkles so nice but you can't hardly see the tiny stone sparkle and I wish they sold them in half sizes so that is why I gave it starsI will wear it but not sure how long it will last.Good for winter days .These glasses are the style my daughter likes and she is wearing them.Should the glasses themselves actually last long enough to get a review on durability, I'll update this and let you know.Fits good toes go numb after miles but not bad enough to disurage riding, shoes and clip pedals decreases fatigue during pedaling.The ears are a little odd and the hoodie is a little big but other than that I love this thing so mfy great fitNice material, looks really cute on.Good quality and a nice fit.love it, vers all the are I want vered.Great shirtOther than that very cute and seems like quality materialIt is super soft and just a little loose which is great.This was washed about - times a week for the past months and still looks virtually brand new.Came quickly and was of good quality.I expected it to be a slightly heavy necklace, but it's really light.The necklace was placed in the wallet.Well made, material feels nice.Pretty mfortable, but if you live in a snowy or icy climate, you need treads on the bottom, or forget about wearing them.SUPER slippery on snow or ice...even just a fine dusting of snow and you'll be on your ass if you're not careful.This is a very mfortable stume.So warm and soft.The buckle uld be a bit larger for ease of manipulation, but that may be a personal preference.The lor was accurate to the picture and the lace is very pretty.Very attractive, nice watch, love it.love some of the designs, uld have done without a uple.Lovely mpact unit with enough space for cards and cash and makes sure that you don't llect unnecessary rubbish in your wallet.Need to make sure that you don't keep the wallet in the same pocket as ins as ins will scratch the lovely finishI have others that are not this way and wrap easily without gaps in beads.The bottoms are high waisted for stomach verage and the top does a nice job of vering too.The backside isn't nearly as flattering as the front but overall the suit is nice for someone that is looking for a two piece while also wanting a little more all over verage.We love these little shoes, and they matched our daughter's outfit for family pictures perfectly, HOWEVER they run very thin.The length is just enough to feel modest.If you're looking for a bright, tropical shirt to wear to a theme party or something, this is it.Quality is alright, service not helpful to change sizeThis little purse is cute and little nitty bout as long as a women's hand.Good product, would buy again.Very mfy shirt, mfy fit.I have wide feet so I purchased this basic sandal for that reason.The straps are a little wonky, not real happy with that.Great quality suit.I've recently tried several brands of more expensive undewear than hanes looking for something really mfortable Laste, Jack Wills, RLTD, Saxx, etc).These are nice underwear for lounging, but I noticed them riding up while I was on the move running/jogging).The socks look great.These aren't high-quality socks.So though these aren't incredible socks they are fantastic for this price point.I'm just giving my impression from initially opening the pack and wearing a uple of them.TL;DR: Thin and not the best quality but a fantastic value given the price.Like the boot trees.Slides in and out easily.Holds the foot shape so the boots appearance remains sharp.These trees only shapes the boot foot so you won't maintain the shaft's appearance with them.Cedar wood leaves the boots smelling fresh between wear and absorbs moisture to protect the leather.It looks exactly as it does in the picture, too.Nice bag i really liked it my daughter uses itVery mfy and looks just like the picture.Seemed to be good quality.Beautiful braceletThe hat is a great fit and quality materialsThough it might be more expensive than other car seats the design worth it.Fits well and quite mfortable.It is very mfortable and soft.I still kept it and figured i'd make it work.only mplaint I can give it is a few of the jewels fell off when trying on.. other then that the dress is amazingI have purchased several straps from Clockwork and for the most part it is of decent quality.Also great customer follow up.Great cut and not too fancy materialThe material holds lint very well but other than that, they are so mfortable.I love the style and the mfortability they provide.I wear it frequently on oler days under other blouses.It is mfy and washes up well.great design for outdoorBut the draw string and off the shoulder option take care of that.These work great for a Harry Potter stume.Very lightweight, perfect for a summer wedding.great shoesI like the pattern and fabric...very light and ol without being too revealing.Great for travel in warm weather regions.It's just straight cut.But for a knocked around effortless shirt for thd house or even a ver up at beach it's honestly perfect.The material and appliques are very good quality.Hits just above the ankle but very mfortable and love the pockets and the backthe material stretches but it feels great and mfortable.this is dress is just perfect.Love these blousessuper cute skirt very mfy goes with anythingThey are mfy and warm but they stretch out easily.Cute, warm and mfyThese are fun socks...surprisingly well made.Great gift for an artist.Otherwise, perfectNicely crafted of real, durable leather.The design is beautifulSome vers I nsidered were too feminine-looking.Matches a more expensive ring that I have.I wish the edges were a little more fringy or lacy, but I like itVery cute dress for the price.Had to sew a few seams but overall liked the fitThis snap on stuff is new to me and I really like the ability to change it up.The bracelet itself is mfy so I will be wearing oftenlNice product thoughThis dress is absolutely cuteThis dress was a perfect addition.The material reminds me of a dry fit spandex type feel.I love that it is quarter sleeve as well.But other than that it's nice for the price.material is very thin but it fits perfectLove the design and fabric.Great giftEven with a stomach, it looks lovely on me.It is great for that extra layer on ld, windy and wet daysThe material is a little thin and clingy though not ideal for hiding my tummy poochIs beautiful, is very sparkly even without the rhinestones.The bracelet is awesome and looks exactly like the picture.These are warmer socks but definitely not ski socks.I was expecting tton or tton blend The necklace is very light honeymbed metal with rounded smooth surfaces and is much lighter than the pendant that's hanging on it, which actually works out great, because it hangs flat and still.The turquoise looks and feels a little suspect, but feels ld and mildly heavy, so I'm not certain it's real, but the loring and detail looks great, but isn't shiny like the picture, at all.It's more of a flat, chalky finish.Earrings are a match, though a little understated.Then I will decide which of the straps, if any, I will keep.I liked it good material an fits perfect.it took a while to figure out all the pieces but its a good quality for the price and pretty easy to wear one you get all the pieces together.I didn't have a chance to wear it yet but hopefully it holds up.They do wrinkle quite badly in the groin area, so I wear a longer top to offset this issue.Looks exactly as pictured and decent quality for the price.Overall, for the price and quality, as well as how many pieces you get for your dollar, I'd remmend for those just trying to get into the bdsm world.Loved the lor and detailing.After first wash the center piece flower came off.The material is soft enough, the upper part really feels like good quality satin.the frills are nice and puffy.made her look little bit more healthy than she really is and the lor gave her a nice shine and grace.Only reason I give / stars is because I thought it was going to be a little more form fitting.Looks nice and clips my tie to my shirt.Other then that it is perfect for my needs.nice winter capI bought this as part of a gift for my grand daughter who just turned and she loved it.The band is very mfortable and durable.Looks great on only mplaint is that it doesn't breathe is hot to wear.The shorts were such an improvement over the usual brief, bikini or clingy skirt options, and would pair well with other swim pieces.Terrific suit just not on my body.The material is very soft and mfortable.I bought it to work out in but it's so mfy I might get another to lounge in.The jacket is made of less than perfect material but for it's a good deal.Looks good for the price.Works great on UV protection.Wish they can make it more beautiful.Will dry out over time, keep oiled with cedar oil.I like them, soft silky easy o get on and a waist band that looks good.But I am busty and have this problem with a lot of clothes.He lIves them and gets the advantage of ankle support.This jacket is wonderfulI can't speak to it's longevity, having only owned it for days, but this wallet is super cuteFor the price, it was what I expected.All in all, it was a good value for the price and if you happen to know how to use a needle and thread.....you are golden.just a little scared the back might peel hopefully it doesn't but besides that it's SUPER cute and perfectMy skin is super sensitive so that uld be why.The fabric is beautiful and it's a unique design.Elegant and yet mfortable.It is a mfortable stretch fabric, but too many hooks to pull together.Wearing it helped me feel mfortable in the pool, less self nscious, while making me feel ladylike.The cardigan is beautiful, I received it as a gift.I like these because they're solid and made well.Love this atIt's stretchy and forgiving.Solid, mfy fabric with a bit of give.The print is stunning on this dress.Very nice product and it seems sturdy.The inserts are thin gel, and made the bottom much more mfortable and helped take up some of the room in the shoes and now I really like themVery mfortable and I got mplimentsGreat product, works fine.It is nice and elegantHUGE pirate statement necklace gets mpliments every time i put it on. HotGreat quality, arrived within reasonable time but a little smaller than expected.It's great because it can be wore then work slakes or jeans.It is a thicker material than I expected which is good.The slide out plastic window holds my not so important cards.Really slick how it stacks the cards so you can pick the one you want.The material is a stretchy fabric which is why I'm giving stars, I think tton would look better.Not the highest quality, but I didn't expect it to be.I am a Zumba Instructor and teaching so often can be hard on your feet and these offered extra support.This happens too quickly and they are expensive.The heat is tightUnique design with a soft and stretch material.Lightweight with a cheap price tag and expensive feel and look tee.It has held up pretty wellI knocked off one star because after nsistent use, the band has stretched out a bit in the hip area, so it rolls up every now and then depending on what material pants I am wearing.I received the necklaces I ordered.Nice dress, mfortable, little see through with the white one but fine with nude lored underwearVery sturdy stretcher and easy to use.Very durable and nfortableIt's fine for the price.Super mfy, look almost like real jeans.This is a great bag.It has many pockets to help you put things into that you need quickly.Super cute and mfortable.I used it alrady and love my Minion pull over sweater.They are also great at keeping you ol even after a good workout.I was very happy with these leggings.Great PriceGreat Material not see through)Base friction/grip less for babies.This wallet is sleek and slim, the materials that made this wallet seems to be of good quality as well.Great bracelet.Its perfect for everyday wear.The material and quality is excellent thoughThis was very cute and well priced for an easy bachelorette party accessory that was classy.They did have the naphtha smell so many fabric items do now.Great texture too.I love this mask.There were some hot glue strings on the front, as other reviewers have noted, but they were easy to remove.There is some unvered clear plastic on the tip of the nose, but it's clear and it's not enough to bother me.Very mfortable and stay in place.Love the styling enough to try and shed some pounds to make this work.I am happy with the performance, but I wish they would hold up a little longer.It does look feel good.Looks pretty much like the photo but a little itchy and smelt weird soon as I got the product but a good product overallLove the sz of chain and the lor of stone Very well made The quality of the charm itself was great and the order arrived promptly.This small charm was quite durable and lasted for awhile until it was retired for another charm.They are priced right and perfect for my grandson, who is growing like a weed.Best bag for the money for a inexpensive bug out bag.Very flattering and fits good.Looks great with bikini top.Needed a bit more room for mfort doing choreography, so, gave it to another chorus member.Otherwise perfectGood thermal for under a Top.They all fit and they are so mfortable.Beautifully cute shoe, exactly what I was looking for.They are durable and work well on the urt with great traction.A warm flannel nightgown, and pleasantly lorful.A good looking scarf...I wish the fur was more loose and free but it is still good quality.I'm making my -year-old a Halloween stume and I wanted her skirt to have lots of layers.Typically I would assume pants like this would be fairly heavy and not practical for wearing in the summer.These are actually quite light weight, to the point I do wish they were somewhat thicker as I am afraid the thin material may affect their longevity.All seams are triple sewn so should hold together fairly well however.Quality excellentNice basic t-shirts.seem to be quality.Abbbbbbsooolluuuteeelllly Gaaaaawwwjuss love my stainless steel ring ...Besides it needs a really good alteration(super long for my size even with high hills ) is true to the size and amazingly amazingOverall I'm a super happy with these leggings.Will order other styles because I think they are a great product.My only issue is the sharp edges it has.Nice dress, however the material was not as I would have expected.The green is soft and easy on the eyes.I love this slim wallet.I have fine hair and the clip did not hold it in my hair.Material and look are good.Great for sleepwear in the hot summerEven when pulling it on you can hear the seams kind of pop" and stretch not indicative of a well-made suit.I DO love the bottom under the skirt).It has great verage unlike many suit bottoms, IMO.They are very mfortable and that's pretty much why I gave this suit stars vs. stars.But it's good verage so I can't mplainIt looks a little cheap, and the weave of the chain is perfect for catching your hair in it.I had to carefully untangle my hair from it on a few occasions throughout the night.For the price this is a great buy.Well madeVery attractiveGREAT SHIRT THOUGH.perfect gift for my uncle.I put a cheapie dollar-store hair tie on the bracelet I purchased, and it stays on just fine.Love this shirt.Love the cut and tailor.The quality appears to be ok.Lovely fit, stiff fabric so may not be so mfortable in the warmer climates/seasons.The case thickness is what i did not liked about it.It looks a little less baggy on me than the picture because I'm ft tall and a size , but it's cute and mfy.The front hung to loose for me, it was too showy, so I added some fabric tape to keep it together and looked greatIt's beautiful though so I'm keeping it.So cute and mfy.A bit lightweight but well made and good price.Red zipper matches looks great.This tassel is fine leather and made with expert care.these work as well as the adhesive stickers".I was under the impression it had sleeves but it does not.If you are looking for thigh verage, this product is not for you.My only mplaint, and it is certainly reflected in the price, is the quality of the fabric.It was already beginning to pill slightly after the first day of wear.Aside from the lower quality of the fabric its a great and modest dressThe silk screening is crisp and easy to read.They are thin, but feel well made.Good quality, a lot better look than expected.Nice and thick pajamas with dinosaurs...so cuteVery mfortable and stylishFor the price, this is a decent shirt.They look amazing.I love the low cut and of urse love the attention it brings.Definitely good quality for the price.Good product for the priceThe material isn't the best quality and it's see-through but, I expected this.Fancy.Nice and roomy and keeps you warm.That aside the look is good and is warm as long as its not windy out.Decent product, true to size, adhesive worked for about - wears.I don't find the material to be any cheaper than the average suits out there.For the price, can't beat itCute shirts but a Lil see thruHaven't used it yet, looks like it will work well though.Well made and very roomy.Haven't washed it yet but this far, it's held up after a few wears.She wore this as a beach ver up while on vacation and received a ton of mplimentsIt is a little too

perfectThese are great workout pants.Love the fabric and feel.no side kicks or climbing into pickup beds with out adjusting.would love a low cut version.I love it, had some treading issues and I trimmed them offThey weren't exactly as pictured, but they're very similar and good qualityGreat value for the priceUse mostly driving into sun to proct skin.This is a nice faux leather skinny belt set.These belts are intended for looks only, and are not very durable.They will make any outfit pop, and give a polished professional look in just sends.Amazing top for a casual busy day or for a long distance travel.This romper is adorable...only drawback the zipper sticks a little bit.Pants are well made and look very good.Made wellThey were just perfectThey were sparkly and the jewels caught the light beautifully.My daughter was VERY excited to wear them to the dance and uldn't stop admiring them once she put them on.My only mplaint which is why I docked a star) is that, as is often the case in beauty, they weren't very mfortable.I was happy to receive my very first mala beads.as usual the garment is silky smooth, very mfortable and east care.It's a wind breaker, not a hoodie.Just the

reset sturdily and it looks good.Perfect canvas for embroidery.nice but cheap, still a good buy thoughI wanted a fitted sweater to wear with jackets and sweaters that did not add bulk and this works that way.Very nice product.Problem is gained a touch of weight.When the trifold finally needed replaced; I thought I would give this Nylon Wallet a chance.With smart phones holding pictures and doing so many more tasks than in the old days; I no longer need the options of a thick older wallet.So much better with this minimal lightweight option.Cute and mfyThey are wider and shorter than the originals, but I was able to still get them to work.Aside from the print around the waistband that is supposed to appear as belt loops, pockets and a zipper, these look greatThey're lightly lined with soft material, so they're not see through at all, and the lining helps to keep the leggings from looking too clingy.AND, they don't shift or slide or bag out of place, which is a plusThey're super soft, very mfortable.They have great customer service thoughEven though the item didn't work out for me it was still reasonably priced for what it is.Very beautifulLook good.These are beautiful statement piece of jewelry.I'm not use to heavy and will only be able to wear them for brief periods of time.Great material, mfortable and cuteeethe were nice quality.The dress fits well but wrinkles easilyMy only real mplaint is the very top of the dress.Great QualityJust as described, somewhat wrinkled on deliver, but looks fine after hanging.I do love this pretty bathrobe-even though it is inappropriately sizedIt is a lovely quality of tton and embroideryJust because I love the robe I'm going to reattach the ties at a suitable levelThis shirt is very fancy,it is a head turner,I bought two deep blue,one for me one for my daughter, but maybe for a very fancy occasionVery soft and mfortable material and I like the length, it's not super short like some, I'm ' and it sits below my waist.The straps were a little loose but I adjusted, wore it for New Years definitely a winI'm very happy with the quality and fit.I've been wearing them for a few months and so far the nstruction of the shoe has held up well.The cushion is minimal and would be good for someone looking for a minimalist fit, the main fabric is breathable and light weight.I was impressed by the quality of these inexpensive shades.It's OK to wear out in the snow or super ld weather but not lazing around on the sofaI'm keeping it for a snow day.Kind of funky looking.Material is fabulousThese are cute sneakers but the lights didn't last longer than weeks and there is no charger with them andI can't find one anywhereIt has a certain stylish pop to the upturned brim that I like and have received a few mpliments when wearing it.Might be a little too well made for a summer time hat, but I'm keeping it in my rotation for spring, fall and a little into winter for sure.Super mfy, but the white is SEE THROUGHI wear these under long shirts/dresses so it works, but not exactly what I wantedOtherwise they are awesome, lightweight, great for layering, very moisture wickingThe lors are great and the bikini seems well made.(About / to / inch padding, so if your daughter is a young preteen you might find it adds too much shape.)I don't think it sits against the skin,but I wish they had used tton lace.Again, I wish they had used better quality straps; personally I would be willing to pay up for better quality all around.I give it a four star instead of because the mesh did start ripping at some point but I would definitely buy this again and I would remmend it to anyone.This is a beautiful piece of daith jewelry.This is my first piece for my daith piercing but the only thing I'm not happy with is the gauge.Otherwise looks greatThese are pretty durable and look really nice.Fit perfectly, held its shape most of the night for the most part, but it uld have used a little hairspray to keep some pieces up.The material is real denim, but not stretchy and it's more of an acid wash lor.Love the grips are the bottom.Well made and good for not too ld days.this shirt is so soft and cute.The blouse is lovely.Solid prop.Fits well and looks exactly as pictured, the only issue i had was that the material was a little itchy.But i have very sensitive skin.Way too smell otherwise sexyThis blouse has a heavy, elegant feel to it.Great buy for a dressy top.She has worn this many many times, it is a thin material but the lor or design has not faded and it is still in perfect ndition.We did use the top and the tail to have her pictures taken in for her birthday invitations and they looked great, but the top is definitely not something I would let her swim in.Simple but cuteVery shiny, has good weight to it.This ring is pretty substantial; would make a nice wedding band.They're underwear...Pieces are a little loose, may need to secure better, but beautifully made.Very beautiful and high quality.The material seems nice and flows well.Nice quality for the price.Great dress, really beautifulThe top is a little smaller than I thought but it's really soft and mfy.They are a mfortable material and a bit more sturdy than what most active wear seems to be made of nowadays.Which is great for working out.When stretched out, they are NOT see through.Cute socks and I love them for my am Crossfit workoutsExtremely all out mfort.No riding up leg or having to pull from the famous wedgey.Great product but a bit pricy for underwear.Reason for four stars is the seam on one glove had to be sewn.Quality: the stitching seems good and the fabric neoprene) is great.But I got to thinking, how do I clean it with the leather on it?Love this belly ring although it will rust pretty easily if you shower with it on.I assume they will scratch and tarnish in short time... however for the price there are no mplaints.Fantastic addition to my wardrobe With Micro suede T shirt.Very mfortable looks great together.Decent nstruction.Very stunningIt's cute and fun but the fabric is very thin which is ok it's sleepwear.Nice lightweight shoe, stylish, maybe runs a bit small.The necklace was surprisingly nice for the price.A very good product for the price.These are hot.It was light and mfortable.I haven't washed it yet, but I'm sure it won't change too much.Nothing too fancy, but still a solid stume pieceI have long nails, so clipping all those clips makes it a challenge of its own.My wife loved them, so we kept them.It's so mfortable and perfect material for the extremely hot summer days.NOT what is pictured, slightly different only silver beading) but still got a few mpliments on it.The neck it pretty the quality isn't all that but like I said the necklace is pretty and a little long than I hope to be but it will doI am very satisfied with this shirt for the price.Great summer church hat.Love this necklacesoft mfortable i like the tag less.The

months.Great product for the priceAnd be ready to pack a whole lotta cleavage if you've got substantial boobage" going on.Nice garment for the price.It was really easy to remove the elastic band it is only anchored in spot).When I received them, they were packaged very nicely and the case they came in was pretty sturdy.The lenses were quite a bit darker than I was expecting as well.Fits just fine keep in mind it's just a piece of layered clothing not wearing it to a fashion showThis shirt works well for that.Looks great and the fabric falls nicely.One of the best shirt stays on the market for the price.Just wish the clips were a bit stronger that's why I'm not giving it stars.Zipper works great.I wear them for long periods of time and they are really mfortable.Used for stretching out the

great protective boxes.Happy with product, service, and experience.I love wearing them because they are so mfortable.I said yes to the good arch support which flip flops really don't have, but these feel so good, I don't even worry about that.I do wish the st was a little more affordable, but I'M worth it lol)Very nice but not as warm as I hoped for.A snap bottom would have been better.Everybody love those leggings, and I love it toonot very well made though.I had to sew it together.Gd quality, I'll buy from these guys again.Good product, serves well.Otherwise, love the top.Good quality shirts the sizing wasn't right.I was pleasantly surprised by the quality for the price.It is very cute, mfortable, and lightweight.Any who, necklace is pretty and is EXACTLY like the picture.Its not bulky like some rsets can be, so its perfect for wearing underneath a wedding dress or any dress for that matter.The zipper in the front makes things so much easier.It came with a matching G string and I felt very beautiful in it.The price is also Perfect.David's bridal charges up for their rsets, and they are no where near as pretty or as mfortable as this one.I do wish the zipper went all the way to the top, I uld use the extra support, but overall this rset is perfect.All in all they are mfy and cute.Beautiful crystal, bought for my wife.Good quality g Surgical Steel, Cubic Zirnia Nose Screw.The clear, crystal stone sparkles and sets well in the setting as well as laying slightly protruded from the hole in my nose.Material does have some stretch to it, and is light weight.It uld be

way they feel and look.Maybe tweak the pockets design, then five stars, for sureVery nice cap, has very good materials.Feels well made.But its love first sightStill, it looks great and i think it will grow on me.The look is great but it takes some time to break in.The dress was perfect for me.This dress is beautiful though and I get so many mpliments on it.Very cute mermaid outfit and well made.product looks good on.material uld be thicker but will work as is.Hopefully it will survive multiple washes.It is a nice looking ring, and I have gotten lots of mplements.Beautiful earrings, although I expected them to be a little bigger as pictured in the description on line.I am satisfied with the earrings and will likely purchase other items from GemStoneKing.But other than that, I love the design, and I love the ruffles in the front, definitely hides the mommy tummyWhen paired with leggings it works great thoughNice but the sequins itch.Can't mplain too much though I looked great.I have earrings that match this perfectly so I do love it otherwiseThe bottoms are very low cut but the top is flattering and nice.Happy with the item.The quality seems really good thoughVery

mfy.Good quality, nice socksComfy and good quality for the price.Good product, however, I can't see that it widened my boots as much as I'd hoped.Maybe it doesn't work too well on synthetic

style.Nice trim at, lightweight and mfortable.A great gift item.Feels airy and mfortable after a single wash.Otherwise looks amazing, kept me warm, and the material is even better than I

were getting so chapped and red from the wind and snow and this worked great to protect their facespretty charm, received it quicklyI purchased this kit because I needed a G needle and jewelry and it was cheaper in the set.When you pierce something you want a little longer jewelry in case of swelling and the jewelry in this is like a post heal size.The buckles needed to be attached, which was a simple fix.The holes for the hip buttons were not there, so I needed to cut holes in the overalls to put the buttons through, another easy fix.This is a very cute yet mfortable outfitIt doesn't have a care tag inside, but their description gives an idea how to wash it.The material is forgiving, and this is very cute onI had to look at it in several different types of lights indoors and then in the sunlight to make sure it wasn't black.Even with the sizing issues, I love it, and will work around them.Nice t shirt, looks good.It was very beautiful I love it.Great dress but arrived with a split seam on the front ruching (Nice for every now then wear, but not a llection piece."This hat is well nstructed and heavier than the less expensive/Home Depot straw hats.Dense nstruction makes it a little less ol" than expected but the wide brim definitely provides significant sun protection.Should last a while--maybe better for the pool than yard work, but will provide great sun protection.I got the orange set, arrived quickly and in one piece.The eye patch and earing are a good value.Nice product- very cute and reasonably priced.Looks and feels quite delicate.The skirt was a little short but other than that I loved itThis is a light weight robe that is very soft and well made.It is well sewn and extremely cute.The slot does not grip the ting too well.Could cause a misshap if you're not careful with ensuring everything is inserted and aligned rrectly prior to the presentation'good quality good priceIts a nice padded case and a very ol design for the price.Fashionable as well as nice quality.I just received this item, and so far it meets all my expectation...I haven't worn it yet, but it is very nice.This dress was perfect for our weddingBut other than that the material was

large.I can wear still wear it working out at home.I've received multiple mpliments on this shirt for those who are familiar with breaking bad.It does what it is supposed to do and it's mfortable.First off, it's a fantastic looking bag.I will ntinue to use the bag though because it looks great and so far is very durable.the fingerholes for the wings are quite tight for an adult size but otherwise the stume was great for the priceI bought this as an outfit for a mmercial I was shooting but to my surprise, it is a quality item.Comfortable and easy to wear, cut for women, but still a little boxy, like most chef ats.It's not a very expensive piece, but good enough for casual dress days.Good quality tie.Great customer service howeverVery pleased with this skirt.They look great; I wish they were longer.the loring is a little different of urse but it's just as cute as I hoped and I'm excited to wear it.Not what I wanted, but still a very well made nice shirt.Got it fast and well made Product.The length was great, but the fabric is very delicate.pros: cute shirt, the golden lace is a nice detail ns: it is see thru, it is a bit snug in the arms.Not sure how the shoe sizing ran.But otherwise love them.Soft and mfyBeautiful fabric and good sizing.I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more mfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail.I like the feel of the leather and the many lor choices.The written description and images leave no surprises as well as the helpful reviews.It gets four stars because while the hardware seems sturdy, I have yet to see how it will wear as I'm unsure if it's a metal or hard plastic material.It's very shiny and vibrant too, and I'd prefer it to be more burnished and even offered in a silver tone, but that's just me.It's a very interesting item, takes some time to figure out how to use it.The strap is on the wider side and seems mfortable, and the purse is super lightweight.Material is thin and it's not a high quality top.Comfy top.Long enough for me '") to just clear the floor, in flats.They were perfect for use on the plane and wearing down to the lobby, etc.They were mfortable with a bare foot and thin trouser socks.They don't breathe well though, so feet start to feel a bit sweaty after a wearing them for a while, though they are otherwise mfortable for wearing most of the day.Would be great if the mpany made some with a more breathable upper to increase the mfort.Love the purse but the front pocket zipper separated first time it was zipped now zipper doesn't work.The look and feel of this dress is terrific.I love this shirt though.So mfy and soft.I don't trust this case to be waterproof, but it is water resistant.Love this bag I wish the skirt had been slightly longer, but overall, it's a good and flattering fit that hides the flaws of midlife and motherhood.Great value for the money.I bough a ring for myself and since I had no trouble with it except the dark stone that only sparkles in bright light.I feel this really helped to lose some water weight and added mpression in all the right places.Very nice long vest....the price was terrific.I was very impressed with the quality for the price.Good verage.Reasonable price.They were delivered way before the given delivered day which was awesome but, they are kind of weird looking but you can tell they're cat ears and they're super fluffyok quality, not wowThe tie in the back in nice to adjust and it is a great flowly dress for summer.Love the earrings they are awesome.The rest of the portfolio is well made.Felt somewhat week, or I need more help in that area.But it's beautiful.This cardigan is well made and the lor and texture are lovely.Love tton socks.These make me feel Iggy Azalea fancy.The fabric is soft and its mfortable.Very nice quality, especially for the price.It feels a little cheap and sounds a little Clanky when loose.Pretty nice pair for playing tennis.Very cute product for the price point.The material is very shimmery and adorable.children will look great in this tutu dressThe band feels nice on the wrist.light and provide good traction and touch.I liked it, however, it's not the best quality.Chosen to wear over clothing to take the islands to a friend" celebrating her final chemotherapy treatment.I do love the pattern though, and the fabric is so light weight and mfortable.Perfect for summerol pattern and stretchy.Great stumeIt is pure wool so it is very warm.I wear it all day at work, which fortunately is not too hot an environment.Great for the price; esp.A little stiff at first but after a uple of washing it is great.It's been used for about two weeks and is holding up pretty well.Time will tell if the leather holds up.These are great quality; much better than what I expected.looks great for the price.Nice jacket for fallThe quality seems good.Doesn't look expensive in any way but will keep and use for every day use.These sandals were mfortable right out of the box and ntinue to be mfortable.These are easier to get on and off due to the velcro straps.Logo is printed on, and will eventually show wear after repeated washing, but very happy with quality.It is a very good replica.I was pleasantly surprised of the quality.I'd be willing to pay more for higher quality.Good quality shirt- given as a gift so I can't say much more.Great fitting shirtThe belt is stiff even after use mostly from the metal part but if you don't mind that this product is goodas long as I don't move too quickly it looks great, but any type of vigorous activity causes an epic wardrobe malfunction.But I bought it to stay warm, and it does just thatReally mfy and looks like the image shown.These are a surprisingly good quality for the price.The yarn is stretchy and not at all itchy) and the lors are very rich.Timeless style.Works in any casual environment.Very nice it feels mfortable looks just like the picSimple but elegantI ordered this band for my pebble time steel.Very beautiful, just the price I needed to make a new outfitThe design and functionality was exactly as pictured and meets my expectations.The pocket design I have seen done slightly better, but they are no less functional than the others.COMFORTABLENow it's perfect.Cheap Chinese sweatshop quality shirt

didn't chip off so easilyGreat quality and love the bright lors.The glow skeleton sticks to itself and has peeled in small areas but overall it did the perfect job of a Halloween stumeAs far as the price, I think it's a little high, but it states it is genuine leather.The passport wallet is nice and soft.It's an excellent quality, and I'm willing to wait for the odor to dissipate not a bad odor, but noticeable).Project took about an hour.Material is better than I expected, but I would still only wear it occasionally for romantic nights, definitely wouldn't sleep in it.Great shoes.Perfect for water playGreat quality and fits great with room to growotherwise it's a wonderful dress, very mfortable.Nice material, ladders well next time purchase smaller size.The material is nice and thick, but no stretch.Little tight at first mfortable when broke inIt's nice and soft too.Pretty dress would have needed too many alterations for my frame.Very pretty at.Fun top to wearIt is nice fabric a little more see through than I thought but over all really cuteGood quality stylish, but the fit runs smaller than expected.I would remmend buying the size up to be more mfy.Very cute and high quality

thicker and better other than that ok.Very pretty and opened it the night before.its unique and just what i was looking forwhen i got the package and opened it up it's very high quality.the riveting is very high quality toVery nice and cute shirt for the price.But I love the way the underwear looks with my jeans and dresses.The case is good quality and crafted well but the image is slightly blurry as if the send picture later was not lined up rrectly.These rings are great but I wish they would make a slightly less domed design.The white tungsten finish is beautiful, more understated than balt chrome but without a hint of the usual tungsten grey) and actually more resistant to scratching, to my shock.Pricey, but definitely does what they are advertised to do.Very light weight

so I will keep it.My daughter uses these as an undergarment for sports, and if she's willing to use them they must be good.This was also a great price for this product mpared to some of the brand names out there.The only issue is the zipper pulls weren't very well attached came off right away after one day.All together it was a pretty good buy with a decent price )The fabric is lovely and the

wouldn't work, but I was surprised.Cute prints and great price.Snap sides make it quick and easy to take offA very good basic sweater at a good price.It's cute and great quality for the price.Great bracelet, I would have expected a little more from it though.Love this shoes very mfortablewarm and very cuteHusband liked the shirts they stay tucked in.neck line is too low cut for warmth otherwise

bra.Comfortable and flirty.Nice pants, easy to care for.Mitts are a great idea but I haven't yet got the hang of putting them on and getting a good fit.For something so lightweight they are surprisingly warm so I know I will use them often after I develop the technique for fitting them.great customer service.Beautiful ringI have sensitive skin and a nickel allergy, and after almost a week of wear, I haven't had any issues.If you're looking for a durable, mfortable and simple band, you cannot go wrong with this one.Nice and light material.Perfect gift for a chef in the familyThe

ring.Pretty good my wife bought this for herself^.^ she liked the fabric, but just a tad bit large on herVery sexy stume, I loved it.I'm '" but it worked fine for a stage performance, I showed a lot of butt to the audience but oh well.Be prepared, it rides up like a thong not full verage on the butt.The detail is great and material is well made.Good product, mfortable, but loose in the legs where I was hoping they'd be a little snugger.However once you get it in it is secure while being very mfortable to unclick when it's time to take it out which is great for a lower st clicker...While beautiful, it is shinier than I had anticipated but I will be keeping it, Took a few minutes to be able to clasp it and also to find zipper which is on left side.Once on, it's beautiful, yet fragile so be careful with handling it.The price is great too.The fabric is also super soft.It is mfortable though and pretty.I have had a lot of mpliments on this inexpensive ring.It is a great nversation piece.I love all the pockets it has.They are perfect for me.It wasn't the quality that I was expecting.Very mfy shoes with excellent support.Very roomy but I'm wearing them with socks for house shoes.Very nice for the priceThe fabric is light, ol breezy.Love the shirt, super mfy.It's a cute bracelet and quality is deceptively good, too nsidering its Chinese made.Keeps body oil and moisture away from expensive to clean silk shirts.Bought for undershirts, worked well but are a little to thin to wear on there own.The price was reasonable, and the quality of material was great.The LED lights are awesome.The light ming from all sides of the face is extremely flattering.Overall I would remmend this to anyone who does makeup professionally or frequents bars and nightclubs, and doesn't mind having a heavy/bulky case on their phone.Great print, breathable and mfortable.For what I paid for them, they have been fairly sturdy.Nice otherwise.I purchased to keep items organized in our large beach bag for vacation.But they are well made, and the zipper is very sturdy, and the carbine is a nice touch as well.made the st trimester sooo much easier.A little blingy for my taste but I'll take that over having my piercings caught on my watch all the time.Not internally threaded however, so I don't remmend it if your piercings are super new.Quality of the metal is good and the lor doesn't chip off like some other product.A very mfortable tank top for working out or walking.I love the bathing suit and the material it's made with.With a little bit of altering the band on the top on my end I absolutely love this bathing suit.And love the material.The stainless steel credit card case was just right to hold my credit cards and a few extras.It looks like a very modest top from the front, but it is very sexy from the back.Item arrived on time and intact.They would make great stocking stuffers or fun little Easter gifts.It's cute as you can see in the pictures but the heart is too bigThe quality appears to be good.Beautiful dress but some of the details doesn't look like the picture shown, But still beautiful.Convenient side pockets.Perfect for work.Great T-shirt for my son.I wish I uld find this style in a little less canvas feeling material.Love this top, mfortable and cuteIt seemed to be good quality.He is pretty rough on his clothing and this seems to be holding up quite well for him.The watch band has pins.They are pins.Overall an apparently good value.It seems to be made properly.It was not damaged by shipping and held it's shape well. Stars: I like it): Good product, but it may have some minor issues.The waist does tie but is also a little looser than I would've liked.When I think pin-up wiggle dress I think of something very form fitting.All in all it IS a really cute dress and I do remmend it.Cool, folds nicely, and can be seen almost) from space.The jewelry set is prettyrelaxed fir, perfect for summer layeringThey do the job and she never has to wear them for too long so we are happy with them overall.This shirt is very mfortable.I think the quality is good and the fit is beautiful, but I was disappointed it did not have

value and looks and feels like it would be much more expensive.beautiful, good quality dress, fabric is pretty looks just like the picture.Overall, its a nice case for the price.Not so expensive that

washed or worn it yet.Finally a minimalist design that works for me.But you can hide that with the right patch placement.love the socksThey are thin, perfect for my baby to walk around and not slide everywhere.While not the most quality material, these do their job well and look like pricey designer glasses.The material is quite thick and warm.Nice looking zip ver for smaller throw pillow.Durable so it's ok for patio use too.But overall a cute sweaterThe quality of the fabric is great.This is a beautiful top.I love the lace.I have previously had the slide belt.The packaging was amazing, and

is well-made.The boots right great my only problem was I uldn't zip them up my legsThe socks are nice, but I'm not sure What happened to George Washington...I thought it was a traditional tton t-shirt but it's more of an athletic tee.Sequins are falling off very easily, but it's a pretty dress...This dress is so cute.smells like rubber really bad my head hurts when i wear it idk maybe this one smell like this but it fits well The necklace hung a little awkward but I think that was because of the dress, not % sure my will be wearing again tomorrow with another outfit.I loved the at and the workmanship is superb but it was about four sizes too small.But, the french cut on the butt makes you look really good.The pendant and chain are okay.Very soft and sexyIt worked out fine, the size

enough to last.So far, I'm very pleased with these socks but I've yet to put them through the test of a wash and dry.I love these shoes, my th pair in the last few years and I wear the others out mpletely.They are perfect for easy walks and slipping on and off quickly for dog walks.The only reason I did not give them stars is that they don't have any arch support to speak of, and take some time to wear in to make them totally mfortable.Very cute and nice qualityIt is just as good if not better than the more expensive trainers I have purchased in the past.I really like the fact that it is lined both inside and out so it does not have that tire feel and strong rubber odor.However they are so ventilated you can see through them which is not so great for winter weather.It is very

know.They are soft and quite cute.The prints are beautiful.The material is pretty sturdy.I liked the shirt a lot but it was a little tight and you uld see my bra through it so I gave it to my little

everyday earring.Nonetheless, I was happy to get a pair that I uld wear after spending around .So, mfort is of utmost importance.My only mplaint is that the inside of the hoop isn't polished like the

hat for my trip to Cancun that was inexpensive, because I knew it would suffer some abuse.This one did the job perfectly, and looked good doing it.I like them but did not give stars because though

weather.Great deal I got mine for and it's mfy, but thin so it's good for So Cal area.This is a terrific, soft, medium-weight cardigan that I expect to wear all spring even into summer on oler

far.I personally didn't mind much but I would have liked it to be a little darker.Very nice for the price.Very lovely wallet.it is a little bulky but in terms of slots of cards, ID windows, zippered secured wallet, it's perfect.LOVE the shirt.I hope it won't break or rust, but it doesn't bend when I apply a bit of pressure so that seems like a good sign so far.If there had been a higher quality version of this that I uld find I would have preferred that because I love this design so much, but I'm afraid this is definitely on the lower-end side of quality.I really do like this product because it can add some flair to a simple crew neck top.(not pictured) Other than the boot vers being horrible, the stume is very mfortable and cuteI really like how it makes my back feel as well as keeping my stomach nice and flat throughout the day.This is hard to do when you rock an Hcup.Its perfect.Loved this but it's not thick enough to be nsidered a sweater.Smart choices, that will lead to a long lasting, classic wardrobe, with minimal wasted money.So I like the dress, but I'm not yet in love with it, and I will try and post photos of me in it once I get a chance to wear for mparison.Beautiful bag that I've gotten many mpliments on.Otherwise the workmanship was better than expected.perfect for slim peopleNice earrings only problem I had is that the stem was a little bit bent.Great attire accessory for his camping lumberjack partyAdditionally, they are not very flexible which is a must for toddlers.Shiny and proportional.Cute choker.But overall no problems and I would remmend.Is well made.Heading is very full, and intricate.Very soft inside absolutely beautiful.I have a lot of socks and I was intrigued by this design.So overall I say stars for almost perfect but nothing is perfectIt's great, good quality materialNice quality my daughter loves themFabric feels cheap but shipped fastRidiculously mfortable.Love the face of the wallet.A bit pricey for what you get, but most stumes are.This is NOT high quality but it has lasted for a few months being worn periodically.They look exactly like the picture and the shipment was in time.The belt is very well made and looks better than the picture.The veil is like the picture and very beautifulFor the price, no mplaints on the quality, which is why I'm giving it stars.Oh, the little buttona are adorable, but they are single stitched on.Other than that, the design is amazing and they are very high quality.Fits me great and I was surprised of the high quality for the low price Pretty mfortable, however after wearing for about hours I uld feel they had stretched out a bit.It's not very form-fitting, either but I like it.Beautifully~.They do increase my perception and clarity/ntrast in low to mid light situations and are great for me for driving.Ultimately, my rating is based on functionality for me along with price.Good product at a fair price.But it was great material and very mfortable.I will have to have it altered.The only reason I did not give it stars is because I was unaware of the little feathers on it.I love the lors and the fabric is very mfortable.I love these mpression leggings, especially for the priceI usually just zip it slowly and guide the zipper with my fingers, and I don't put too much in the pouch and it works fine.Better for longer thinner torsosGreat gift for my tween-aged Harry Potter fansturdyI like the wallet, and the quality is nice.From the pictures I thought I would be able to easily fit all my cards, cash and IDs.Overall, this is a great wallet, just don't plan on carrying a lot in the center.These are sturdy, rounded pieces on elastic rd.Love the material If you want smelly good" leather, this may be for you.But, an excellent choice for those who are keeping good money with em.Good design.It's a nice dress, looks beautiful.This is a good quality made at.It is actually thicker than I expected but the fabric is soft for the a winter jacket that gives the at not so gorgeous look as on the picture.I've bought M and it fits excellent even with the room for a very warm sweater.I do not know how warm it is as I do not wear it yet.Nice shirt, it has a good flow.After that I received many mpliments on it and it is very mfortable.Very happy with these pajamas.The fabric is incredibly soft.Happy with how mfortable it isThe only problem is that I am short and so they ride nearly up to my boobs, which is actually nice and warm for ld days.Other than that these are very mfortable.Very ol looking and unusual.For the price though, the kitch is worth it.I really love this necklace.Beautiful purse.Looks exactly how it does in the pictureI'm sure this can be fixed by knotting the straps, or cutting them and re tying them.It would have made more sense to make them adjustable.Nice shirt...material is breathableVery well lined.All in all I do Love this jacket so far...Comfortable for flip flopsI grew up with ws so the gift was perfect for me...:-)Good product overall.Giving four stars because zipper is not that smoothThey are very mfortable and I love the lors.Really fun fashion piece, especially nsidering the very very low price.Hat looks a little cheap, gets the job done however at a cheaper price.The fabric is nice and light, however if you have the butt, then good luck because the back is very short...So cute and so mfy...great for winterOtherwise it is greatThis product is a totally great idea.Very mfortable, was a little big but not bad.The tton is soft and stretchy while still able to support, most tton goes soft and baggy after a uple hours for me.The front pouch is very wide and while its acmmodating however it was very flat and doesn't really show as much as some other brands I've tried, good but just not as flattering.Great active maternity pants.Only wish was that the material was somewhat more thinner and more breathable, but all around, I have loved wearing the pants when working out.The belly gets vered and it's mfortableThis necklace is very pretty.The pendant is not quite as sparkly as some of the reviews led me to believe it would be and that I had hoped, but the chain is delicate and makes the necklace look more pricy than it actually is.It is a decent ring.Aside from sizing, the ring is absolutely beautiful.It can easily be used for ring stacking, but is also just a gorgeous band.However, it stacks nicely underneath the ring's halo and looks stunning.This bra is really well made.The zipper is sturdy, seams are strong and clean, and the material has a nice supportive stretch.Is very stylish, and I like the blue a lot, so I'm going to keep this one.Very soft and very warm.Great quality, but runs very small.Nice quality and style.amazing quality for the price.Great product thanks.The only issue is durability.Dones't look super expensive but still very nice.It has a funky smell at first, but if you open it air it out for - days, it'll be fine I put strong sachet in it).But I love the look of this bag and for the price, I'm happy with it.incredible product, especially for the pricePretty lacy summery shirt.This is stylish, but not the best fabric.This umbrella is adorable, easy to operate, and seems relatively safe with no sharp rners or edges.When it arrived, it had some fine white powder on it, which was easily wiped away with a damp cloth.The fabric is soft and the design is beautiful.For the price, a perfect hat....worked well for the event I was attending...the lor gray will go with several lors.They are generally pretty mfortable and if you start with wearing them for just under an hour a day and then gradually breaking them in, you should be fine.Keeps me warm during the winter months and my boyfriend wants one too.Thick enough material you can't see through, but thin enough that they are mfortable to work out in.Great fit, very mfortable.When I put it on her, I make it a fun production( wow so pretty...) we don't use it often, but when we do, she keeps in on.It's a very lovely scarf, nice feel and design.Decent material quality, washed well, pockets are cuteAlso, to give you a better idea; if it wasn't for my breasts the would've been perfect.The only reason I'm not giving it stars is because although it is a cute dress, the material/fit is obviously not expensive.I dressed it up well with my hair, jewelry and shoes it does look a bit plain without being dolled up).Great choice for the priceI have to find a top to wear with it.Nice bags like itComfortable, easy to put onNice, quality sweatshirt.My only mplaint is that the ears don't stick up as easily, but that is something I should be able to fix.Not very slouchy but still a good quality beanie.I got this for my mom and she loves it the watch itself is great and descent quality.Great wallet for euro dollarsMy mother still loved them and they look greatThese are great and the price is fair.They're soft and mfortable.Fabric feels nice, light and soft.Great basic cheap black v neckThe fabric is somewhat rough, but mfy.gets wrinkled easy and stiff but worth what I paid for it.they're pretty good for mimicking what uld be a ridiculously expensive sneakerCute PJs.It's a unique looking top.mfy for lounging around the house or quick runsThey are good for warmer weather as they are not thick.Great price and works for what I got them for, good for someone who doesn't want to spent a lot on work out clothes.Very stylish with an elegant look, respectable length verageNice and sturdy.Cute BraceletColorful, beads are pretty, seems good for the price.Its ol and feels good just order a size upBut they work perfectly fineSuper cute but material is made out of thick t shirt material.Very soft and mfortable.We're not too nfident about the material, so she only wears it on occasion.I love the rainbow stitching.ReusableThese bands offer much more flexibility in fitment for some reason, I'm guessing because of how it threads through the pins.Pros: The quality of the product is great.They include , mm pins, but for some reason don't put that in the description.Item looks well built.I haven't had the chance to use it yet, but I'm sure it will make link removal a breeze.The material is stretchy, and the dress is beautiful.GREAT BAGThe shirt is a little shorter than I prefer, but a soft, mfy material.Nice, warm, and mfortable.This shirt is wonderful.The necklace is very pretty.My one issue with it is that the closure clip in directly under the chin and thus makes it very hard to get on, adjusted, and straightened with your child still happy with itThey are light weight and seem a little delicate but I still think it's a great buy for the price )Chain sucks if are aggressive or on the nstant run otherwise it's awesome to wearI love this necklace thoughThey are great for this price.Nice necklace.All in all they are mfortable.Good quality material.Felt good knowing my daughter was protected from the sun.This backless Bodyn Spaghetti dress is perfect for a fun night out on the town.Your entire back will be out that adds to the sexiness.The design is excellent as it strikes the perfect balance between elegance and sexiness.For the price, this dress is excellent and perfect for a fun hot summer night outVery nice lor stone, just a bit bigger than I thought it would be but I have very short fingers.I felt unwell and was so glad to have the mfort and warmth of this product.Keeps my ears warm as expected.Very mfortable and cute.Great products at a great price.It fit under the seat without difficulty and I was able to easily access items that I needed.I uld it was easy to pack when it was laying down, so that I uld more readily access them from under the seat.The green fits best and has a harder material.Both are very nice and the style at neck area is unique.The teeth are great, and look fantastic, and very realisticI'll find a way to make the teeth work, because I love them, and I really want to be able to wear themDefinitely better for the thinner ladies, but it still brought mpliments for my xAnd easy to wear.Fits really nicely the top is not vneck decent quality for what your paying.The at is very warm and stylish.My industrial had to be pierced on the shorter side due to me having smaller ears and it is really hard to find a barbell that fits perfectly and this one doesThe quality of this item is top notch and I have had no issues with sensitivity which is impressive.This item has held up very well the past few months that I have owned it and I get a lot of mpliments on it.I would give this item stars however one thing that really doesn't work for me about this item is how inflexible it is.I can easily brush my hair and nothing gets caught up in it which is a huge bonus.Overall the quality of this item is amazing and I remmend it but just remember there is little give so if you have a healing piercing this may be one to save and show off when things are fully healed.I love that my eyelids aren't touched by the mask.It makes wearing it almost weightless, and it did help some with preventing the air from drying out my eye.The vinegar helps set the dye so it won't run.Stretch nicegood product good parcel service good design I remmend itLovely sleeping gown for nursing or expecting moms.The fabric feels good on skin, will use it anyway, very mfortable.Perfect piece for the priceIt is sturdy and polished.love it so mfortable and warm.Quality and value are superb.Nice wide waist band.My wife loved them except for the clip on the back of the ear ring.Removed the clip and it works fine nowThe fabric is very soft and mfortable.They are great for layering.It is a beautiful design and close to as pictured which surprised me.It is lightweight and you do have the option to make it tight or loose which is great Sturdy shoe.Shoes were delivered as promised in good ndition.Great transaction all the way around.Looks good and is as describedThese are excellent for wear, but the black dye they use takes FOREVER to get out.A little large which is fine, if I gain a few pounds I'll still be able to wear the dress in mfort.Well made and very stylish.Perfect dress.Nice looks just like your sample photo.Otherwise I love it so much.The sublimation process is not perfect.With the right foundation garments and a slip, all my curves and bumps were in the right places.All in all, the fabric is nice and thick, and it's mfy and looks exactly as advertised.Good for a nd grader in a flag football league on natural grass.He has high arches, so I needed to swap out the laces for elastic laces for a more mfortable on-off process while they are being broken in.Heel is reinforced and overall the cleat portion it sturdy and does its job.It would be nice if there was some sort of padding.The quality is very nice.Quality exceeds the st.My husband loved this wallet.The quality is beautiful, simple and elegant.No give in the fabric, however high quality material, and well made.The high low effect is not quite as obvious as what is pictures, which I liked.Overall exactly what I was expecting.Medium weight fabric which is thicker than another tux shirt I have.I love this so much.I don't want to give the glasses themselves a low rating as they me in a nice holder and appear to be well made.Very beautiful I think my aunt like itComfy and cuteAnyway, worth the price, wish it were padded but still looks good.Good purchase, cloth is heavy, good for winter over leggings with something underneath.The white stitching looks classy.There are ways to fix the zipper though, so don't let that disurage youThey were perfect and exactly what I was looking for and got here in a timely mannerI can't wait to wear it for my hubbyLove the style of this shirt, and the fabric is light weight and made of a beautiful blend material.A beautiful piece of jewelry.nice basic vest drapes agreeably to mpliment one's figureLove everything about them, BUT the only problem I have is they have no traction what so ever.There good for if you'll be walking on carpet or some type of floor with some type of traction.Other than that they're perfect.For the price, this veil is wonderful.Before I bought this veil, I was thinking about making my own but I disvered that the materials from the fabric store would be over .This is a good deal for a crafty person because you will get all the lace and the tulle for a very good price and then just put a little bit more work into it to make it perfect.I am very happy that I bought this instead of the veil from the bridal boutique because this veil looks almost identical and after I make some adjustments I think it will be perfect.No adjustable straps.Why not have the back and neck straps tie so they are adjustable and would give a better fit.Love the stretch feature of the waistWorks great for our year old son, he can be out in the wind and ld and is still very warmRegardless, super mfortable, easy to wear.A great buy for spring/summer monthsFOR THE PRICE IT IS MADE FAIRLY WELL.Feminine and delicate style.socks are fine, my personal preference is for longer socks e.g.But the socks are adequate given the stYes, very beautiful,Good Deal The price is pretty incredible, the material is harder that one would like.It is beautiful, I didn't use mine because it took away from the detail of my dress.Love the material, I'm a very petite woman and I can wear this shirt no problem, under the arms is a little larger than I'd hoped but not so big that I can't wear it.I love the print in this shirt it's so adorableI just recently sewed them back in place.It's so flexible and I'm able to put so much stuff in it, without worrying that it will overfill.Nice and warmThey are light as expected.LOVE the quality of this bikini.ol itemGreat little product.Great productSoft cloth, style is not like in the picture.Very mfortable shoes that I can wear all day.Looks nice, but it is a little challenging to remove.Socks are fine.If you don't care and these fit your budget, like me, these work fine.Great for yard work.I do love these shirts, I've bought them in different sizes.Not as nice looking in my opinion.wasn't mfortable because of that.Haven't given these a good test yet, but they are mfortable, don't slip at the heel, and feel like they will serve me well on the boat in ol, wet weather.Quality of rubber and elastic seems good.It's the exact as in the pic good quality productgreat hats, get a lot of mplementsIts really cute and good quality for the priceIt is made of a legging material and has Velcro on the fins so you can easily open and close them.very stretchy, not much support for working out but its ok for lounging.... and lovely print, I got alot of mpliments on the lors.Luckily they were on the seam so it was VERY easy to repair, and I have no idea if this is a mmon problem or not.Once the repair was done I was very happy with it.look greatComfortable all day and either in the locker room at the gym or underwear night at the club I get lots of attention and turn every head in these.Nice quality and fit based on my waist measurement.Loved the quality and fabric, but a little too smalleasy wearReally gives my pebble time a more classy look.That and it is prone to scratches but it was very affordable.It is not as fitted as in the photos, which is probably a good thing.Very soft tie, easy to tie.Looks great with a long necklace to dress it up a littleThis is a great dress and looks good on.Overall it's a great dress and I would highly remmend itIt looks nice and feels solid, and I would say that it was worth the price.Great shirt to pair with leggings and maybe a sweater during the winterIt wasn't flattering at all but it's mfortable so it was nice.This is a beautiful suitThe quality is great and heavier than I expected.I am '" and it's long even with heels.soft and cute designVery pretty earrings with a classy look.But they are made well and are still pretty.Nice affordable belt,takes a little to get use to.The material is also super soft, which is unusual for denim shorts.Warm and CozyIt's also partially lined making it nicer than many of these lacy shirts.great value for the qualityNormally that would be less of a problem, but you aren't meant to wear a bra with this, so it can be difficult to stay vered if you have a larger chest.Of urse that's my own fault for not reading the measurements more carefully.The material is awesome.She looks great in it.It is mfortable.Nice shades; good quality frames, adequate tint, stylish.Hard case would have been a benefit though.Love the skirt and tie though.Love the tote great valueRoomy fashionable for office.Great plugs for the priceIt will kind of ride up a bit but I attribute that to the material.Overall, it's really great.good quality material but longer then I thought and I'm a inch waistFits well, nice and soft, don't care for how the llar lays/lies?Lighter fabric than I anticipated.Comfy shoes.I uld easily return for exchange but the quality, look, feel and price make that small flaw tolerable.Durable and cutethicker than I was looking for but still a good product.This is a pretty nice fitted dress shirt for the money.Very unique and perfect for a tea party I was invited to.This would look beautiful on all body types.The material itself is silky and very lightweight, and I didn't experience any itchiness or irritation with the lace trim.It is very flowing, very mfy in both ld and warm places.My only mplaint is that the fabric is just okay.I wish they would do a T-shirt material, that would be star worthyOtherwise, it is a good quality fabric.It's thick enough to not be see-through at all, and I think it's a good price for the top.I prefer lower maintenance items, and should have checked this first so be sure to take that into acunt.SMELLS LIKE GASOLINEVisually attractive, very easy to read.He does a lot of work outside of our house in the yard and with the pool.These mpression socks work very well for me.Quality shirt, seems like it will hold up fairly well.I love them, so very soft.and extremely mfortable.The shirt is VERY vibrant, and I love that.but all in all, it was my favorite.... Until I washed it.......Cute shoe.Was also very impressed with the quality, she wears everyday and chains are still holding strong.Heels uldn't even help.Giving it / stars because the design and quality is great.Feels like the heavier material but lighter, and plent strong for body throws.The print is cute and the elastic in the top makes nursing a breeze.Love this clutch.Cute and lightweight.It is great though overall.Great stumeQuality seems pretty good, definitely soft and mfortable, and the lors were very bright and beautifulOverall they are very cute, affordable and the LED lights worked fine.I like the way that this dress drapes, it isn't clingy yet shows my curves without being skin tight on my stomach area.cheap and light weight but it works and still looks good.It came quickly and is of a decent quality.The sleeves are a bit long but not enough to be noticeable at least she doesn't care at all.I still ache but they are supportive and firm.I like the all-leather, supple belt that I bought, and I like the buckling system--now that I know how to work it.Good quality t's.Beautiful shoe though.Great holiday necklaceThey have a pleasant tton feel about them and I like the fact that they are not too long.The material feels strong and the best part about it is that I can wear it as a suit or as individual pieces.Love the boots they mold to the foot making the arch for your foot.Quality of the t shirt.These are nice mpression shorts and they are well made and much less expensive than I've found in the sports equipment stores.This dress was beautifully made.Bottom line--Dress is beautiful and very nice quality.It blocks the sun from my baby's eyes and neck very well.The front goes into his eyes some but not bad I might just have to adjust it a little better it's still new but we have used it a few times.It's a good productThis fits well but the fabric is a little too see through for me to love it.I don't like it when you can see my bra through the fabric.I wish they used a little bit stronger metal for the nnecting parts so the it uld be more reinforced but other than that I love them.A little wide for my nose, so I was sore for a few days, but this seems pretty great other than that.But very functional and great price.Nicely made hat and has a larger brim for sun protection especially when our daughter is out swimming.Great Costume..I found the fit to be good even with a a fairly heavy athletic build and the quality better than I had expected.It came in a nice zip up enclosure too.For a mfortable but not fancy stume this would be a good choice.The glow in the dark letters don't really glow in the dark, but my father loves his shirt and wears it on his lazy daysThese look better in the picture then they do in real life, but I can't mplain, they still look nice on my wife.I loved the arch support and cushion but I have a big toe and it was rubbing on the shoes which do not have a lot of give because of the jelly that wrapped around it.I think if the mold/structure fit, this would have been perfect...but not on me ( Loved the arch support.Loved the cushion.This has looked great and the dress looked great.This gem looks very noble, is well made.less strong and more prone to split and less likely to handle the mechanical stresses at the mechanical interfaces.You can wrap them in stuff to add bulk to the width achieve similar results, but you must be careful when you do so to avoid bad nsequences.love my shirt....love amazon This shirt is cute and is a decent quality.Because it is a seasonal item I expect to get many years of wear out of it.ol mfortable Came as stated, nice material.Great shirt overallAs for my Calvin's, well the quality in those have gone down hill recently while the price ntinues to go up.However that does give more room for a thicker sock with out cutting off your circulation.They do have nice toe room.They uld use a little more cushion in the sole but they are not unmfortable at all.Can't say I would wear them if I had to stand and walk all day just because there is very little shock absorption or cushion.Top quality for the price.Sturdy functional and look good as hellClear and durable for the low low priceGreat basic thin hoodie for a good price.With tools that I don't exactly have laying around my studio.Not a big deal but a lot of extra work for a simple purchase.I just bought this for the time turner necklace.It has a ring so I can attach it to my POC and not worry with a larger purse.very light material.The Ruffle butt on these is super cute and it's nice that there is snaps on the sides so they are easy to remove.good quality.Made nice and great priceThey seem to be good quality so far.But again, for the price it is a pretty bracelet that will do for some occasions.It's a beautiful stume, nice material.Love the feel of these jeans.Hat is good quality.nice light shirt for the summerIt looked much better.They are mfortable for flip flops.I love the way they feel with that cushion sole.Cute bracelets but not good for hair ties like I bought it forI absolutely love my necklace.The chain is a little thin, but the monogram piece is stunning.Other than than they are quality pants.Too snug to wear in public but fun for lounging in at home, assuming you're a big geek.We put this crystal in the center of a chandelier we made for a reception.It was beautiful.It reflected the sunlight in a beautiful waymfy and warmHaven't worn yet but cute for the summer and into fall.This dress is very pretty and the material is fair.Liked it alright picture shows lot more detail than product has.'Breathe holes' great idea in theory, but not a good idea in practice.Other than that pretty good item for its priceA seam ripped during a trip but the mpany replaced it without any problem.The quality is excellent.This one was perfect.Looks better than the picture to.Nice firlooks nice, feels greatMy son is in month or T clothes, definitely has thick, chunky legs, but I never thought undies would be too tight for him.Surprisingly the padded undies actually fit him better.But I work in health care and never sit So hey aren't built for all day wear But they are very nice and seem sturdy Just need to use insoles and wool socksWish the fabric was slightly different material but for the price is great.Perfect for short people which is nice because most clothes are made for much taller people.They take a little getting used to, but they are warm.Very stylish and easy to access diaper with buttons at the bottom I ordered size mos)This is a beautiful top, but the mesh material isn't exactly what I expected and the shoulder straps are quit a bit wider than I thought they would be.Nice product and great quality but runs too small.Espalma is known for this type of raised waffle weave.They are thick enough that they aren't see through yet breathable.The material is nice and is well made.When the hat is dry it is perfect sun protection.Nice casual polo for a good price.I kept it anyway though because it fit perfectly and was of sound quality just the same.mfortable and looks niceI think a MoM shirt should have more of a female cut.... but i love it otherwise.It's not the same material as shown in the picture its not t-shirt material it's more of a dressy fabric) and the fit is perfectDurable, warm and the lors are perfect for the many outfits you might wear.The Quality of the material was actually better than I expected.. After reading several reviews I was so nervous that I would receive just fabric..But other than that it's great especially for the price..But other than that very cute bikiniWill work fine as a dress though.These are decent for the price.Great purse for the price Love the material but .This one adjusts better and keeps him warm.Great quality metal, not flimsy, and stones are all nice and attached well.They are not super high quality, if you sit on them, they are done for sure.They may not be bullet proof, but they are so affordable, if mine ever break, I will absolutely buy a new pair.Great price, great quality fabric, and very pretty.The top is ideal for modesty without losing the feminine look.The crisscross in the back was lovely.This prout is quality.I was impressed with the quality of shipped product, packaging was great.Very absorbent and cute.The quality of the product is GREATVery pretty and meaningful for a special friend.This is a gorgeous gownloves them, expected to stretch someThese socks work well with the smaller hand warmers but you need boots that are a little large, so you can get everything in the boot easy and are mfortable.Not warm enough for ld winter days or any extended time outside.Nice quality and lor.Roomy interior, easy access pockets.It didn't lift my butt at all but I am naturally gifted in other areas so I wasn't expecting a miracle.The wallet is beautiful and spacious.They wash up nicely and have kept the bright lors.Would be excellent for me if taller.Mine arrived very wrinkled, so make sure you have the time to steam/iron it before you need to wear it.It has a very cute 's flair.I wish the imprint on the front was better quality but this will serve its purpose for the price.Cute top for Shimmer and Shine fansThese legging are soft and of good quality they do run a little Big but was very happy with them The material is too thick for summerBeautiful earrings, spices up every outfit.This was a beautiful belt.For the price point of this product, it is very good.Comfortable and soft.It's appropriate for mild weather, but not super ld temps.I love the material, it's very soft and rather stretchy.I was very please with the quality of the product.There was nothing else in the package aside from the garment.I am going to need to play around with some bra's and see if one with a wider band can help ntrol that.If it wasn't for the fact the the rset is too long, I found it mfortable, liked the back support I got from it, and had no issues breathing.These are sweet.Comfortable and light.I love that its ribbed so you don't necessarily have to wear a braThe adjustable waist-band was a massive boon in early pregnancy when morning" ha ha)Because of how baggy it was on me, only suitable for very casual use.The fabric feels very nice against the skin.The workmanship is good.The wig was in good ndition after shipping with lots of cute pin curls.All the pockets make it easy to organize and find things.They seen a little fragile and won't zip unless all the teeth are perfectly lined up.And they are so mfyI love the feel and the shape.Looking for an inexpensive shirt that fits... this did the job.The printing is definitely not the best.These earrings are just adorableThe price is great but would have paid more for better quality zippers.It's a great bag really.The belt does its job and looks good.It's got potential but for the price, I'm expecting better material.It does the job well and crimps are there but not as significant.neat camp for the sheFabric is stiff, and due to packaging in the smallest possible space, was will take a lot of work to remove the wrinkles.Very nice quality for the price.Overall, the product is simple, but good quality for the priceSo far this has been a great product.Comfortable, and ok for the price.Haven't washed them yet, so I can't mment on the durability yet.I was pleased by the quality of the jacket, it seems well-made and it's very cute.Like a

just loved them.Theya are not particularly cushioned but sturdyIt is not skimpy, so it is perfect for those that want proper" verage.It doesn't have pockets, so I had a friend add a pocket on each of the two side seams and now it's perfect.The permanent straps are long enough to go over the shoulder as well.But I will have it alteredThey are polyester so if that is what your looking for these fit the billGreat tops, but I thought they were a little thin which is why only stars.They stretched well without losing its form.Absolutely loved this product, the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was simply because the wallet llected dirt very easily and there is no real way to clean it.Other than that I love all the mpartments.I used this because I was a waitress and it made it very easy to keep my money and tips separate but in one spot at the same time.It's a sturdy wallet with high fi protection",no mplaints really,but,the product scratches up quick,thus leaving it with an unpromising visual...other than that,it's alright.Love it, although I wish there was a little more room in the arms.I wish the clasps were a little more innspicuous, I can't wear it with a smooth fabric that hugs the body...looks good.It's perfect for work.Definitely a good deal and the price was right.ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT...Product is well made.This water shoe is durable.The price was perfect but after paying for alterations it was more than what I wanted to pay.Nice skirt, good material but I thought that I would be able to wear it to work.They are not adjustable as others of this style are.They are sewn in place.Otherwise beautiful.Love the dress, my girls uldn't believe it came from Amazonfine productAs far as protection from UV or other harmful radiation, I have no idea, for there is nothing on the glasses themselves to indicate such protection.I did not know about the fact that they do not provide any protection from harmful radiation until I purchased them.We both decided on a tungsten ring and this one stood out the most.It's just as good of quality as an dollar one I uld've gotten from Kays.Very soft material, love the lors.It's very sexy though definitely like the photo so you need to be well manicured.Love this braceletThe quality of bag is not the greatest though- I was expecting a heavier fabric.Other than that is a good, soft, supportive bra with a firm wide band.This dress was beautiful and stunning.Great quality but the dress does run larger.It is adjustable with a velcro strap in the back.The depth also makes it more resistant to wind, activity, and longer hair causing the back to slide up.The slightly longer peak bill) is good for additional shade from the Sun.Cotton feels good against my forehead.This may beme my favorite grab-and-go hat on hot Summer days.It is versatile for work or play.Quality isn't the best but it's still cute and flatteringOverall, a beautiful fascinator which I'm sure to wear anyways for tea parties and for funsies, but don't expect the orchid" one to be pink like in the picture.Honestly though, I would buy again because it is well nstructed and a beautiful piece for the price I had paid.For as inexpensive as they are, they're greatClasp works well, and the gold shines nicely not fake.I am returning it but not because of its quality.VERY STRONG MATERIAL... MET ALL EXPECTATIONSIts a great robe to wear and I love the full zipper.Material a little heavier than expected and stiff but after washing, I'm sure it will be softer.I always buy a larger size in robes so I have lots of room to move in around the house and also when I watching television for verup.Good quality just runs large...returned for smaller size...hope it will arrive soonperfect for the needed projectNothing fancy, nor fashion.Perfect for summer time.Excellent valueMy daughter loved this it is very cuteBought for Maui, used by my daughters, great on hot sand.It was excellent...only reason I didn't give stars is because it got dirty really fast and I can't find a way to get it shiny againNice and soft but a bit thinner and less spandexy than I hoped.Not shiny.It fit well, was a great ral lor and the beading was durable and they even sent extra beads just in case).Good quality and I love the gold flecks in the material.Great looking shoes but it will be great if the y remove the button inside them can be unmfortable for the kid ti wearhas no padding in the top, lovely lorsI'm very happy with this mfy sweaterThe fabric has a good quality.Super mfortable and soft.But I packed my shirts in a rolled up fashion and it worked out well.Such a lovely print, genuinely.A strong smell but well madeI'm very pleased with the cut of the dress.It is beautiful, and came faster than expected.Daughter loves the scarf.great necklace, love itI really liked the material and style.The quality was good and the rise was great.The top uld have more padding/verage but

little bit of stretch makes them very mfortable.It's mfortable and I've even worn it on a long rode trip.warmest stume I have ever worn.If the power ever goes out in the dead of winter, I know I have the tigger stume to rely upon for warmthOne was very cheeky" shown in pic) and one was straight up a thong.Good quality, looks and value.Looks very nice but the wristband uld be better quality.Super mfy and easy to wear.(kind of cartoonish but it fits well, is soft and mfortable, doesn't look bad, or look cheap.The loring is bright and the anchor on the front is well placed.I have worn it a uple times and it has held up pretty well.But for the price you can't beat itBut the pads are removable thank god) so I tossed them and wear it without them.the zippers work just fine for me.the only issue i had, which is personal preference, but i wish it was softer.feels too much like leather boots, and i'd prefer a more soft leather.Bought this for my wife, and as some have stated it is not super sturdy.Easy fix with some pliers.However, it looks great and as long as your just wearing it not trying to build a deck or repair a sink) you should be fine.I love the way this necklace sparkles when it catches the light and it's a great size and length.It's a very pleasant surprise because I was worried it might be heavy based on the dimensions.The red surface has a few spots but they aren't very noticeable and for the price; it's worth it.I'm very happy with it and will ntinue to wear it and love it.Not as thick as I would like for a sweatshirt, but looks good, and fits good.They did, very cute, very warm.This robe puts me in mind of the old Elvis" and Jesus" velour paintings.The material is soft and light weight.It's very shiny material, not quite the classier look I see in the picture.Think very shiny.Looks well made though.The black area is heavy and stiff satiny ribbon texture).That might be more preferred as it holds the gown to a shape it would definitely not have due to the thin and soft texture of the velour.That being said, I wasn't looking for beauty so much as verage and functionality.You can definitely wad this up in a ball and crush in a suitcase and pop it out at your destination without a wrinkle in sight.This looks just like the photos and feels fairly well made.bought this for my daughter for Christmas the chain has with stand.Good socks but wish they were just a bit longer and had a heeldon't like how it looks like the lace is ming off but i love the shirtCute gift for the caffienated nerd in your life.Aside from a stiff, and slightly awkward to use at first, zipper; this is a fantastic at.Suffice to say, I was kept warm and toastyI appreciate all the zippered pockets, the ample hood, and the soft micro fleece lining.These sunglasses are just perfect.Amazing price point, the polarization is awesome, they look stylish, and feel mfy, my only mplaint is they are actually a little too dark at timesOtherwise, a perfect purchase, especially at this price pointGreat pattern, good weight to fabric.Will get lots of wear.I love the crisp clean lines feel of this product.My only ncern is for the interior dividers and there longevity given lots of use.Not sure how protective the case is, but it is adorable for the price.Beautiful pattern..Love the scarf.It is a great length and weight for snowy winters in michigan.The zipper get caught a lot so be careful when zipping up and down.It fits great but has a strange smell when first arrived.Cute necklacematerial is not as good as I expected.It is really soft on the skin.Better quality than I expected at this price.Very feminine.Bright and cheerful.The stone in the middle is quality and sparkles like a blue diamond.The silver is real and quality has held up well.This think just

little thin but ol I'm always hot.Only gave stars as I noticed some of the gold threads are in danger of ming loose.Looks good and solid.It is actually shorter and stiffer than I expected but that may

description and picture perfectly.Made for a great gift for my daughter.Soft, stretchy and mfortable but definitely in need of a slip.Thick leather, looks good, fits the buckle, good price.I've had this necklace for about years now and it's such an amazing piece to wear.It really looks great in fall and spring seasonsBeing summer I can get sweaty and the stainless steel had withstood the

price.Wish they had more floral suites.Nice beach ver upI love the lors and the flexibility of the barbell.A few of the barbells were difficult to tighten the ball, but eventually the threading smoothed out and now they work without a hitchNice item for the price.It reaches just below my bum so I keep this dress limited to beach days/nights.Other than that, I love the fun print and it's very mfy.Arch support heel, and sole are very mfortableGreat stume.But, overall, it was perfect for her.A small amount of fashion tape kept it in place, or wearing a bra with slightly less verage would resolve it as well.I haven't used them yet but they are very warm.Nice packaging.I loved the creative setting, but not for long.These are so mfyOtherwise it's a great fitting top.Otherwise the material is soft, the lors and vivid.Yes it can get a little Jane Fonda as far as looks, but you can't argue that these things are so practical.BUT, I love this case for panties and socksThe top netting has six mpartments, which can fit thongs per mpartment when rolled.The bottom part of the ntainer is great for regular boy shorts, granny panties, and lingerie.Perfect for moving around a lot,

rrected with the pads.Overall quite mfortable and can be dressed up or down as needed.But nice for as long as they lastFor the price it's not bad but I wish it was tighter quality is goodIt was unexpectedly lightweight and had a nice feel" to the fabric.Classic look.:) Haven't worn them outside much so I don't know how well they hold up in the elements.I do wish they had a little more rubber

flattering.I love the cut, flowy yet still reveals my figure which is what I wanted.It hangs a little lower than I expected and the straps are a little too long for me but can be fixed with a quick sew job.(not paper thin by anymeans) I wish it were a little thicker in regards to material) the print on it was a tad faded but overall I'm pretty pleased.I like the feeling of the material, the leggings are medium verage but are semitransparent, so black undies or a big shirt, dress, or sweater are preferable.Son loved zipped picket for iPhone.Both sparkle nicely in the sun.very nice slub t stylefits smoothly against the skin, washes well, great productI wish they were a little softer.I am totally mfortableIt's very well made and very simple.Lovely dress..fits as decribe..worth the

my time wearing them and will order more.I got about six months wear out of mine before they were basically destroyed but I wear them for work everyday so it makes sense they'd wear out sooner.I just

pictured.Love the shirt fabric, style, etc.Definitely not rich leather look but nice quality nonetheless.So simply yet so chic.I ended up just removing the elastic bands on the arm bands and it's perfect.But I have short let legs so it's not much of a problem than a quick snip and stitch can't fix.The dress was long enough to pass the bend-over" test I'm ' " so this is an issue) and the material was opaque, beautiful, and flowy.I'm very large on top so it didn't button to well but beautiful shirt to say the leastlove the dress and fabic.nice wool, not sure if it's cashmere.It's made okay, I wouldn't expect it to hold up for years and years, but it was great for our show and probably will last us another few years with light use.Stitching isn't finished well, so just make sure you clip off those loose strings..but fabric is nice just order up a size service was fastI bought this outfit for my daughters th Birthday Princess Glam Party and it was perfect for the occasion.These are mfortable and easier to don than the zipperless stockings.Fits my year old son and I just fine for a halloween event.It's simple but a bit quirky which is what I like about it and it spiced up my little black dress nicely.These are great, especially at this price.My only issue is they are hot and not very breathable.Even still they are mfortable under dresses and much better than sweaty pantiesI wish they would make a tton version of these that are equally affordableI think it looks exotic if you know how to throw a look together too.It is a little loose and not as form fitting as I would have liked but otherwise it is a great dress for the price.With the / sleeves and the heavier material it will be great for fall.Gives good support as well.Nice details.It's amazing what the little technology-fibers can do.And they are cute and very warm.The insides feel so soft.Nicely made, Perfect look of the butterfly with the derations in the wing.Looks great with my tye dyesVery nice but padding uld be a little thickerI was expecting a bigger bag then what I received but nevertheless it's a super cute bag and I still got a lot of mpliments on it.The lors are not as vibrant as I'd hoped, but the graphic is beautifully reproduced and stands out nicely against the distressed fabric.This dress otherwise is great aside from the fact that it is a little short but I still love it but be warned there are still as I said before less gems on it then in the picture.I'd say it feels pretty warm but its not ld out to find out just how warm.Really happy with this product.This is a high quality product.Loved the material and super softI give this four stars based on the quality for the price.I got it for a flat footed man in need ) that is all day one his feet and additionally wants to hike.I tried them myself though too big for me) just to have a feel, and I did find good support and mfort with soft top layer.Really enjoy these they seem to be working so far the glasses them selves feel pretty cheap but they don't look that way so you get what you pay for and I payed wellI have to say I was impressed, while it did shrink after washing for the price of a new hoodie you just can't beat itIt's light weight but you can't see through it at all.Very ol for the summer heat.It was a little difficult removing the film off the foam but otherwise this worked exactly the right wayBeautiful dress, long, only problem I had with it was the back which you do have to tie.This suit is well made.It's a beautiful dress and made well.This is a stunning dress and looks and feels expensive.Nice Mom and baby a little flat but okaySo these flowers are BEAUTIFUL.The backs/stoppers though are loose, well most of them.My wife likes the wallet/clutch but it has a very strong chemical smell.Definitely useful when you are between regular pants and maternity.It is a beautiful stone and setting.Rest of it hangs mfortably.Nice light fabric.It proves to be doing its job just fine and has a unique feel thanks to the texture pattern suitable for the Game's design.The make of it is cute Item was purchased for a child fit is good, durability is good, style and lor is exactly what child wanted.I received this dress weeks early which is greatThis dress is GORGEOUS I never expected it to be this beautiful.(Edit)Well I tried the dress with a pettiat and it is still entirely too long now I don't know what to do....I guess necessity is the mother of invention.Nice quality but wasn't right for me so was returned and had no issues doing that.Love this beltWell made and tons of mplimentsThe silver lining underneath the black laser cut top is a little shinier than I expected, but the fit around the waist was really flattering.But it's tton so you uld shrink it but the style is better largerSo if you need it for waist training and weight loss maybe this style isn't for you.Good quality but it runs small.Like the shirt, it is mfortable.Nice style on a budget.It is a lovely stume as many have shared.They are amazing quality thoughThis product is as expected.If you zoom in on the straps you can see the detail on them.This one isn't as soft as hers.It is not well put together, not sure how long it will last.Beautiful suitThe dress had such rich texture and was very reasonably priced and I love that I remmend any one purchasing from them your dress will look as displayed.There's no particular arch support but the sole is beautifully thick and accepting.fun to wear..ears will slide so need to bobby pin them where you want them..Pros: It looks great and was easy to install.The size of the pearls" is perfect and I accidentally bought two sets one of my -workers bought the extra set from me and she also loves them.The top was perfectThe leather is really soft and the canvas is thick and of high-quality.I really love this bag and I can tell from the quality that it would last a long time.Super relaxed yet stylish bordering elegant.Nice flow and sturdy.the material is not that cheap.... ill suggest to double check the size its nice to wear at workPerfect accessory for Halloween stume.It's nice thick fabric.Perfect for lounging as well if you like wearing yoga pants all the time.Good quality material, very mfortable.Made her looked good and charming.ol shirt.Its a nice hat, really soft and stretchy but I just thought it would be a little more slouchy".very soft and kept me warm.Nice socklettes, a bit tight but reasonably mfortable, don't slip in use, wash well.It is a little boxy and does look better open and the wash is not as its pictured..The jeans are great quality.It looks like a more expensive jacket than it is but does have a few quality issues.Customer service was greatThe hat is beautiful but the brim was less pronounced than I expected.It will still get lots of wear this winterStones stay in placeGlasses were packaged well and shipped efficiently.Material feels nice and mfy, will try other lors me this spring.well made and nice and thick fabric to hide bulges mfortableBut this is a ol undergarment thing.It is definitely beachwear not at all what I was hoping to use it forNot the best nstructed, greatest material, or best fitting garment, but inexpensive so for the money, it's a good value.Nice little number that dresses up super cute with the right accessories and shoes.Fair warning: it wrinkles easy, so hang it up after laundering to avoid having to iron it.I threw a belt on over it and it looked fine.Overall, if you're looking for a cute dress to wear out to bars or clubs and be able to spill drinks out without worrying about ruining since you got such a good deal, go for this dress.Alternatively, if you're looking for a mfortable dress to wear to class or errands, this would also be a great option.Gorgeous, but for some reason I thought they were pre-drilled.fun to wear uniqueThe shirt is really more ral and fits my yo daughter better than my yo.Adorable skirt.My only mplaint is that I wish it had listed it had gold sparkles.Best watch I have ever owned.Stylish, futuristic.If nothing else, it is very mfortable and was inexpensive.Definitely looks way better on the model thoughBecause it is handmade, so there will be a little different, and it is normal.I tell them that one is different and didn't say one word about the quality and they choose to argueBeautiful but I wish the O-rings fit a little tighter, I've already lost one.I can still wear it and be mfortable.I was looking for something that would hide my belly but still be kind of sexy, and this was perfect.These are great for my plantar issues.They stay sturdy and supportive.I would remmend them for those suffering from flat feet and runners who need the extra support.good quality though, no problems with shippingThe mpression socks really help my husband.The Gold Toe mpression socks have helped relieve his tired achy legs.He's medical doctor is pleased and the are less expensive than TED hose.It did keep me warm with extra layers and stayed dry on the inside but after a little bit, the outside was soaked.I would definitely pay more for those features Hint hint.Also, the zippers need a little improvement but it's a great softshell.Are great value for the money.I would remmend it to all who like tton snap button shirtsThey are very mfortable hiking pants.I will give it an actual turned and stitched hem for a nicer look.not good qualityThe quality of the dress certainly fits the bill.Very mfortable good for workout but its a bit transparent.I had absolutely no duplicates which was great.Based on quality alone, I must give these four stars.They look good, are well made and have progressive dimming which fits perfectly into my daily lifestyle.For the price, I am sure that one uld find better sunglasses.Fits very well around the neck and does not look at all cheap the fastener is a bit delicate and difficult not sure how long that will last but overall very pleased with this necklaceI love diffraction glasses and have many of them.I would love to see a product like this that allows me to rotate the lense while I wear it so that the diffracted image can move without me having to tilt my head.I am not sure if it is the metal, but my piercing gets aggravated after about a week of nstant wear.Nice quality runs smallVery mfy and stylishThese socks are too

stayed on and offered fine protection and were mfortable.I love the material and everything else about the tank, but I feel that it uld definitely be slimmer fit.Hands-down the olest t-shirt I own.Made well as far as the material goes.It's very soft and not see through.The fabric is a good thickness with a slightly elastic give.Fabric is polyester and supposed to look like a sweater, but would be nicer if it was actually a sweater, but overall love the design and can't wait to wear for my holiday partiesA little bulky but they work pretty good.Beautiful fabric, love the print, and was very excited to receive the skirts I ordered.It is exactly as pictured, the length is perfect to wear with sandals, and the material is very soft.Great support,I spend - hours a day on my feet the entire time.Could feel the difference the first day.Once hemmed, this will look great with jeans.Great hat, perfect to keep ol and out of Suns raysThis made the legs ride a bit and not as mfortable as I thought.Far more prettier than the pictures.I bought this with the intention of having something a little warmer and professional looking for work.The jacket is very soft and mfortable to wear for extended periods of time.It is also extremely warm which is great for the fall and winter weather here in Seattle.Soft and mfortable, but a bit on the small side.I love the vintage look, and was thrilled to find this suit at such a great price.This suit is very flattering for a fuller figured woman.The molded padded cups cannot be changed, so if you are smaller chested be careful.I appreciated the thicker cups, as they keep their shape, and look great.The beach for days straight, and many times in the pool.The lor looks just as good as the day I bought it, and the shape has stayed after many machine washes.The quality of this bikini is excellent, but the sizing is say off.VERY BRIGHT, VERY NICEI didn't wear it for more than hours at a time to allow my body some time to relax.Nice but wrinlkes easily.Although when I got it it had threads everywhere still great thoughAside from that these were excellent.They're mfortable and last a long time.They are also inexpensive particularly when you nsider their lifespan.Not made for outdoor-noslip-untry-dwelling.Nice and zy and very cute.I'm only months now, but the belt feels somewhat tight.It has stretch that give super body hugs but the side seams are unforgiving.Almost perfect.Still a perfect body cling, easy to slip on and off, too.The lace was evenly centered and super soft.It feels great against my skin.They would get ,stars, but the toe scuffed on the first wear, showing tan under the turquoise.These are really nice toe socks, especially like the non-skid feature on the bottom.Perfect for what I needed.The material is great and has plenty of card slots for cards.Very sheer... No swimming with this...But it sure looks good walking on the beachIt is a simple bag that I can tell won't last too long if not handled with care.The at is nice but remember it is short so spring/fall but definitely not for any type of sever weather.Wish it wasn't quite so stretchy.Yes, it's a little bulky and stiff, but I imagine the stiffness will ease with age.I've only used it for a few days now, so can't mment on durability, but certainly a cute, well made product.Apart from that you will be scratchy in this dress which might be unmfortable, this is a beautiful dress and i will remmend it.it looks elegant and classy and not cheaply made, i bought a medium and fits perfectly.Comfortable but loose at the bottomStiffened it with starch and an iron.Works as an undershirt, great for running errands, working out, or just around the house wear.The chain is a bit short but that is okay because everything else about it is perfectGreat material, great fit, would have stars if

this dress is great to just throw on or even wear as part of a stume.It's a beautiful shirt and the fabric is very soft.A little more yellow than white but the material is very nice and i'll keep them even though I can't use them for the wedding.The repair was simple since the gripper was designed to easily open and clamp down on the string, so its back in ideal shape.The material and quality looks good otherwise and the gloves fit just right.However, ripping off the gripper was not a pleasant experience when you just dished out some money on what you thought were quality gloves.It's a little long and may be worn as a dress depending where your going but the material feels good on your skinThese shoes were so beautiful as flower girl shoes.They're very sparkly.For one daughter, they have always been very mfortable.The product is excellent and easy to use.The material isn't as soft as I wouldn't hoped but it's nothing unexpected since the price is pretty lowFabric is thick and holds its shaoe well.Great money clip and looks awesome stars just because I think less can be the perfect priceI also have the Powerstep Journey and while the Pinnacle doesn't have as much arch support, the do feel more mfortable when wearing them all day.When your out and about it's less noticeable because of background noise, but it's still there.The other versions of Powerstep do not squeak, so I think it's just the material of the Pinnacle version.Excellent on boat NON skid no kidding very light weightThis is an excellent item.Brilliant product ideaGreat styleMaterial appears to be durable.Good quality, looks nice, good price.These looked good but it says Baby Boys Footed Sleeper Pajama so I told her we would have to get them for her brother instead.These are in fact lightweight perfect for summer.We're talkin' basic bed linen from a hotel.I've gotten other tops from Roaman's that are just better quality overall.I love the sleeves in particular.Well made and beautiful detail with the peack applique' on the front.We thought it would be a bit fuller and pouffier.But with the two layers of tulle it is still a lovely dress and perfect for the masquerade event to which it was worn.My rose trinket box is beautifulVery good quality product, but the size is not even close to what I wear.I do water aerobics and it is easy to exercise in.a very nice piece to look at and wearSo mfortableBeautiful derates well w one on each end.I will just touch each jewel w a lil glue.No other charms like them..These are great for yoga or even for people who might be at risk for a fall.They have great traction on the bottom but it does take some getting used to with putting your toes into the little toes holes.This is a really cute top and it's flattering to figure.Even though it's wicked cute the cuts on the hips are high.Good material glad i took a chance bought a few lors for my tripThe place detail is lovely and well made or the price.Exactly like the picture and all.Quality is what you'd expect from fast fashion from China so I don't mind minor stitch problems.the shirt material is pretty thin, but it is soft and fits pretty accuratelyColor is perfect.Love the detailsThe only thing that disappoints me is if you have never owned a painted leather purse before you don't know how to care for it.If these shorts had a draw string that you uld really tighten the shorts with then they'd be perfect.Shirt is nice lookingLove the material, very soft but thin).Very nice n softLove this kimonoLoved it still, but was expecting more of a tunic.Good quality at a fair price.They appear to be good quality, although they did seem to scratch easily the reason I gave stars and not ) Still worth the priceBEAUTIFUL PIECEOVERALL BEAUTIFULI loved the fit and the style, so kept it for another event, but needed to purchase another outfit for the original purpose.Comfy, good value for money.Love the price and quality, but delivery took over a monthnicely made.Very good quality brand.Excellent price point.It fit perfectly, the only reason I didn't give it stars was because it did not have snaps in the crotch and I had to be creative using the bathroom.Looks good and is fairly mpact.The quality is amazing, but is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, a lot.It just wasn't suited for me personally, but it's a beautiful and high quality piece of body jewelry.These pants are a tad on the small side, and the fabric is fairly thin, but my daughter loves them the lors are bright, and the fabric is soft and mfortable.The leggings are ruched a bit at the bottom which is a nice touch it makes it easier to order larger sizes since the ruching keeps any extra length in the legs from dragging on the floor.On the whole, remmended, though the thin fabric is best suited for fall and spring not a ld winter and might not last as long as a thicker style legging.Very mfy a bit long but shrinks after washing.Also the zipper feels like there is a kink in it but it operates ok.It is a good productmy daughter is thin and it's not loose enough to sleep in mfortably, but it's cute.Some of the socks have less stretch than others making them tough to don without straining the fabric).The designs are fun, though, and they seem to be of at least average quality.It's cute and protected her from the sun.They're so mfortable and softI was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hinges at this price point.This is a beautiful, soft, luxurious, and mfortable robe.For the price, you can't beat it.While this makes for a great summer robe I personally prefer a longer robe that I can wear all winter.Overall his is a very nice and good quality robe.These are wonderful shoes.The material is good y very stretchy but the problem is the bottom of the dress is not like The pictureQuality was as expected for the price.I love this robeThey are dark as I needed and very mfortableGreat to use but my son eventually learned how to pull it off.I like the beach ver up so far but I haven't had a chance to wear it as we are not experiencing beach weather yet.It says its % tton, it doesn't feel like tton, but it's still nice. stars because my kid loves it and loves to put his glasses in the holder.great wedgeI love this bracelet.it is so beautiful.great quality.made of beautiful black leather that DOES NOT bleed when you were it.this is a great productIt is a very cute flat with lots of bling.Looks great on but no support in the bra area and it's very low in the back.I like the fabric, the semi-sheer quality is sexy.nice and looks exatly like picture but it stains easily beause of the lor fits my inc hp perfectly with no extra roomThe dress was great for the priceThe material seems to be decent quality, otherwise.This is a great swim top with wonderful support, however, the top's ups size seems to run small.Attractive hatThey are a bit loose on me but they are still niceFolding is a little awkward, but works fine.Sides work well and the glasses are mfortable.gift looks good to me% Best bracelet I ever brought.So far they are fairly new but I do like the feel and they do tighten up a loose fitting pair of shoes and make them feel good.my daughter loved the dress.The necklace is very cute.Design has a tactical look to it and is very practical with the numerous storage locations.Very nice product, enough space to securely hold cards.Only reason I gave this product stars is because the black model is very prone to scratches and scuffs which are distracting to the the overall beauty of the build.Very mfy actually I went back and bought another one smaller for a giftI love the skirt..It is pretty big, and the starfish did me off, so I had to put it back on, but it's still worth it for the priceGreat belt, rachet function is nice.Nice and soft but its a little short..

perfect for a weddingStretchy tton fabric.Easy wash multiple uses this spring and simmer.Lightweight but not see thru.Beach ver up, with capris or a skirt for dinnerBut for someone who is more careful, this uld be a great shirt.Material was more silkier than expected but fits mfortablyThe dress is really lovely and well made.Expect a lot of poof in the skirt but the tulle uld easily be altered if wanted.Product was great, quality was what I expected.I found this piece on another site for + shipping.Design is as described and of good quality.I am '" and the it is a little bit high on my backside but overall this is a great product and made well nsidering the price.The dress looks just like the picture though, super soft, and very flexible, I LOVE ITThis dress is very sheer so be aware of what you wear underneath, I purchased the light mocha.I bought the large because i'm in my rd trimester and my boobs&tummy are getting huge it's stretchy so plenty of room to growIt's very mfortableThe top is lined, which was unexpected and great.Good product if you don't want to tear up your socks.The bottom was as expected but the bottom didn't fill out as I hoped..Very cute and stylish.It is stunning.You must be very careful with it though, the wings will break.Its pretty goodConstruction is good.Very nice hat, great fabric and fit, just ordered another one in black.Great quality, case does get scatched easilyThey have a very pretty design and they kept my hands dry.I'd say the top just manages to keep everything in place but the bottom is wonderful.Not great quality it's thin and I can't imagine it holding up well)Love these earrings but would like a backing so they don't slip off.Only n is the dangly pearls are a little fragile so you have to be careful not to pull them.Perfect selker Perfect dress I love itI love that they look like Oakley's but st a few bucks so if they're lost or destroyed I can easily replace them.Good quality shirt and nice lor.Overall it looks amazing I am so excited to wear it.This dress is lovely, looks better in person than in this photo.But cute shirt love itLeather is thinner and not high quality, but will soften with a good nditioner and use.It arrives wrinkled but is not iron friendly...Top fits nice, even with DD's, there is no under boob cleavage" mfortable and not binding in any way.Skirt is greatIt's simple so it layers well under almost anything, and looks pretty much as pictured the front is more straight across for me than sweetheart.The pads inside make it so nothing shows through, and you can move them if you want.It's definitely not a crop top unless you are an A cup or less, so I've never worn it by itself.The customer service was excellent though so I'm editing my review and give four stars.It was not packaged very well.Not quite sure of the material.But, long lasting, great quality" aren't my first choice of words to describe the craftsmanship.But, definitely not a set that I would remmend to someone with sensitive skin.It worked perfectly.It is easy to use and helpful going in and out of doors without getting wet.It would be nice if it was llapsible, but I don't know if that would be possible.Looks great, no boning so its very mfortable for all day wear.Soft enough that you can wear it without another shirt underneath.It is a scale replica, but it is exactly like pictured.For the price this is a great dress.Color is cute and it has a little texture which is fun.Nice, sturdy case built for credit card use.They are very mfortable and stylish but they are a little big on meVery mfy tooI fell in love with the material tho.It's absolutely beautifulIt's very pretty and high quality, the only issue I had was that my cell phone Samsung S did not fit in there, well .it fits but the bag doesn't close even with nothing else in itSo far it's wearing fine no issues.Very nice but the top front layer is not cut as pictured.These are really nice shirts with a nice feel to them.Really pleased with the price and quality.Keeps you olerI really like the lacy bottom feature and also like that it doesn't make me feel like I am wearing my grandmothers girdle.Material was smooth to the touch.Sturdy, very nice looking.The material seemed really nice, and well made, but I would remmend emailing the mpany for a customize size before making any kind of purchase.The swim trunks are attractive and have an inner lining of breathable fabric, but unlike most swim trunks, this pair does not have the traditional mesh briefs inside.So far so good in terms of wearability and durability.The materials are good, but the stitching in some places is a little sloppy.Nice fur feltThey were mfy and fit just perfectly.I received this product fairly fast.It was in a nice/elegant package.light and mfortable, perfect fitGood quality and lor...just order up in sizeI haven't worn this in the pool yet but I think it will suit my needs.I bought these not quite a year ago and have been pleased with them except that they are getting worn out.They are still doing their job but both insoles have large wear holes were my big toes touch them.I do like these insoles, I just wish they would hold up better.I have custom made leather insoles I bought years ago and they have years of life left.It is super cute and I can't wait to wear it on Spring breakAnd the graphics are awesome, a vintage look.Perfect set of stud earrings.Very nice material stylish sexy and bey practical But it's super cute, mfortable and soft and you can't beat the priceHigh quality, opaque work out legging for a reasonable price.This is a cute swimwear.They are super warm, have big pockets and an attached hood.I love the prints and the high quality fabric.Overall a great purchase thoughGood shoe for the priceThe shirt is awesome the material is a little thin but still wearableJust be aware that these are fragile.I like it a lot pulls in my stomach and well not so much lifts the butt but still helps with the overall lookIt is well made and very different than all the swimdresses out there I do get lots of mpliments when I have worn it.The ring is beautiful, and I really love itComfortable and it looks really nice with a skirt and heels.Great shirt, love the saying.Fabric is very thin, but soft and stretchy.This was fun- wore it on vacation until I lost it in a waterfall.The fabric does not wrinkle so it's great for packing in a suitcase.But not unexpected becaue of the price.It provided plenty of warmth and protection from the wind in C. For ld climates or motorcyclists as an under layer this will keep you warm.It is easily adjustable and dries quickly.I love these gauges.They are nice and sturdy, they don't feel cheap.Otherwise, good buy for a good price.Made well with soft maternity, beautiful bright lors.Not a pencil skirt or anything but it reminds me of the girl's skirts in Grease.Very mfortable and I love I don't have to wear a slip because it just attaches to my leggings.The shirt mes in nicely folded, but it needs to be ironed before you can wear it out somewhere.Very mfortable; love mid lengthbeautiful tiara, i gave them as gifts to identical twin, adult sisters.The tiaras were beautiful, bu t had to be shaped carefully) to fit their heads.Love this shirt and mfortableDon't put in the dryer make sure to hang drygood quality and very mfy.Otherwise very sexy and good qualityFull lining in front.it needs a scarf; very bland but fits fineThe dyes don't really bleed in the wash which is nice, and they are decent shirts.I wasn't fond of the shiny apron or I would have given it five stars.My wife likes it for casual wear.LOVE these boots but they are unmfortable to drive in because it's difficult to flex at the ankle.I feel nfident that this is just a breaking in" issue, so I'm not upset by it.Aside from ankle flex, they look great, feel great, and I want to buy them in black as well.great shirt.The dress and material looked and felt great, the only thing was a received an imperfect dress.I did not wear it, although I would have because it looked great on.The earrings are beautiful and made well.However, its really lovely and sexy.She likes how soft and mfortable it is.It's honestly basically a bra, no mplaints but I wish I knew.My son likes these, he says they're mfortable.They are pricy but I guess, among his set, stylish?but if you don't enjoy your melons being shown, you shouldn't buy it.THE WIDTH FOR MY FEET WAS A BIT TOO WIDE BUT I WEAR THEM ANYWAY FOR THE COMFORT ALMOST EVERY DAYI like it, it's mfy.the only thing about these pants is the material wasn't the best in quality i disapointed but they look good on i like the styleGreat price and sturdy.I replaced the necklace piece with a better necklace.Didn't think I would like this product but the fit was nice and even better, I was mfortable all dayGreat quality and a fair price.Being a wrist wallet, not carrying a purse, the wallet needs to hold phone, upons, change, cards and ID..... My only mplaint is that it needs to be a little more spacious ..First time I order were a better quality, this time it has some quality issues, the glass me off very easily.The pants are extremely mfortable and look nice as well.It's more durable than I expected.You can't look too closely at the jewels and their placement- the design is not symmetrical or nsistent.So far a good product.It is a nice shirt though and is very mfortable and I am pleased with it.Not fancy but they work.she says they were mfortable.Comfy and flattering for big baby belliesThis are very pretty, all the designs are different and very attractive.For the price these are a great bargain.It is tton so very light, not see thru and mfortable.Fit well, all lights lit up, only flaw is it would occasionally turn on after I turned it off, but all in all great purchase.Exactly what I expected, for a great price.I have only worn it once, but so far, so good.Beautiful as picturedWell-made and very mfortable.My daughter needed a light scarf for her school musical and this scarf was perfect.The price was right for what we needed it for and it held up just fine for the shows.Color very pretty, well made, soft.Very neat looking necklace.But manageable.Great quality nice design.Detail awesome.To be fair, I saw all the reviews that spoke of the gold plating ming off this necklace - that's why I bought it.I wore this for a uple of days a week, max) before the gold started ming off and I got the necklace I wanted.It's one of my favorites.It needs to be a little more durable for firmer tummy ntrolSmelled a little weird, but it's light and airy.Great print quality.Great for creepers at the gym, thoughIt's very mfortable and the material is not that heavy.That being said it is mfy.Simple and cute.The quality of the dress is great.Couple adjustments need to be made for my personal perference, but overall satisfied.Very beautiful, worth the buy.Perfect for work but I expected it to be a little looser.Less expensive and easier to find than in the stores.This is the perfect bag for me.The only issue I have is the outside material of the bag,...it looked a lot better online but for the price I guess you get what you pay for.Other than that, love this bagNot exactly like the one in the show.It looks nicer than the low price, but clearly not an expensive piece.If you have sensitive ears, I would stay away from this.These really are great diapers.The snaps on the side make taking it off when wet much easier.These are not shoes, it's a child's purse.The flower is well-attached to the purse.Great value, stylish, functional.I received mpliments on the necklace.For the price it uld have been made some what better.Definitely the material uld have bee better.The necklace arrived as shown and is a great accessory piece.While it is not high quality, for the price it is a great, fun necklace to wear out or to work.the material is thin so it is great for the summer.The fit was mfortable.It's a very rich pigmented lor which matches many of her tops.I just folded the extra down over my stomach and it was fine.I'm now weeks and the band is still going strong.This is a lovely moon necklace and chain.It's not as vivid as I thought it would be.So, I removed it and added a tiny crystal charm to it that I purchased on a trip I took.Now it's perfect for methe look the feel everything.But overall it's prettyThe fabric and workmanship is superior.The wide straps remain in place.For perfect.It's really good quality, and I love the sizeLovely garment, but not what I uld useThe tooling is beautiful on it.Very sparkly, light weight and mfortable.Thin, and yet warm even up here in the mountains.While I think this Jacket is so cute, the material is not so good.They are very mfortable and very cute.We would have paid much more at a bigger department store for exactly the same quality.looks exactly like the picture, clearly quality material, has a bit of weight.But they are polarized and I like that they are very lightweight.Cute top/dress that looks great with a belt synching around the hips for support.Just fine for a good stume piece.I used this for a bit before I had a chance to buy maternity pants.It was great for standing and walking.Good Product.Great dress for the price.I like the dragonfly pendant, would not call it a necklaceShipment time requires improvement.It is the cutest hat ever.Sturdy and we'll made.I wish they made a sterling silver version.It uld be used to hold together many different thingsElastic keeps the cards safe and intact within the small wallet.Exactly what I was looking forGreat sweatshirt for the kidsThis is a great looking belt and I wear it all the time.The quality wasn't too great, the seam was loose in the shoulder area.Good price, see through.It is a good product.I got this for my daughter to wear in a play and am glad it is long to her ankles) and that she'll be able to wear it even after the play for every day."very cute in the photo, but try it out and the buttons is very delicate, I fall short.This is unbelievably soft on the inside.It's also a very thick sweater material.The box it came in is really nice, and would make this belt a perfect unwrapped gift.The buckle looks just as good as the day I got it, and the ratcheting system still functions perfectly.Looks beautiful and flattering.I had to knock a star off because the cat only had painted on eyes and not the little stone ones but other than that they are perfect.Very nice looking and washed and dried nicely.Have not worn yet, as I bought them for oler weather.Great for when you are on your feet for most of the day, keeps knee pain at bay.Worked well for my husband's event- good price.cute topso mfortable.Nice drape to the fabric.They are extremely mfortable and easy to move in.I'm '" and it is a little long and cuts into my lap a bit when I'm sitting but helps my posture.I bought the steel bones in black" one and it's made of neoprene.My main takeaways are that it isn't latex when it states it's latex, but it's great for long torsos and does help with posture.I had to alter it slightly; like I made the at tighter and the skirt part shorter as I felt it wasn't flattering enough?I was able to put it back on with some super glue luckily.These earrings are very pretty and delicate looking.I was so excited to receive this bikini as I love the way it looks.This is a very mfortable robe if you want something ol and lightweight.The material is very soft and a little stretchy.It's my favorite type of fabric for pajamas.Nice hat, a shade too big, have ordered hatbands to improve the fit.Great shoeOverall, an excellent product and would buy again.Really nice shirt for the pricevery flattering fit as expected material was a little rougher that expected but worked greatThe product will most likely end up being perfect after I hand wash it.It arrived smelling like mildew.Other than that, its prettier and more flattering then I expected.These shoes are fantastic.I decided to try them as a ld weather, rain weather work shoe or a general riding boot.:) That being said, the vibram sole is great though it is stiffer than the normal barefoot shoe.I'd buy more ears from the person/seller I got them off of as they were very inexpensive anyway.They are almost perfectThe strappy uppers are the right kinda tightness, supportive but mfortable.I got them in ral so they match my ral and rose dresses, skirts and blouses really well.the top is a nice piece... the skirt is too tight.but I have an alternate that will work well, and the top alone is worth it.That said the quality is really nice, and OH, MAN I wish it fit.I paid only for this necklace, and was pleased with the quality.Plenty of room even with thick socksIt's high waisted which is what I love.The material is great quality; stitching is well done.When the mpany heard I wasn't fully satisfied with the size of this item, they mailed me another bead a beautiful owl) to ensure I was happy with my experience with them.People notice the incredible ribbed detail on the front and the matching studs/cufflinks.What got me to love this shirt was the top button has a bit of an elastic pull so that the neck is always mfortable and not strangling youOverall very good set for the priceIts a very nice top for work no wow factor but I like it.Very pretty, gave it as a gift and the person loved itI checked at stores for lace blouses for some time never found one that I liked.FancyFinally had gotten my package and the quality was great.The necklace, earrings and bracelet were a perfect match together.Love this product's quality however they are more like G than G.Overall I am very satisfied with this product and would definitely remmend these earrings to anyone looking for smaller stud earrings.My wife was really happy with the bracelet.This is an attractive band and it appears to be sturdy.And , I've got to question if these are real leather.Looks beautiful, Feels great, Without forgetting the all important mfort aspect.This is a great package of gloves.Great for under basketball shortsNice reasonably priced bootspretty ol I have to figure out a way to extend it.Soft and mfortableI'm an artist like the parsley design/it's a bit flamboyant in purple,but I bought a blue one also/ good for the priceThese are soft, warm and mfortable so are fine for my purposes: lounging around house in fall and winter.for proper squats and stretching.Super cute and my grand daughter loved these pajamasNot quite the quality as I hoped, but nonetheless, would buy again.These shirts are both lightweight polyester, perhaps lighter than I expected, and this fact is my reason for four stars rather than five.A simple, pretty bracelet with good lor to the stones.It is kind of a spandex-like texture and I feel like this design would look a lot better with just a tton plain black texture.Love this shirt, but how can you not like anything related to Labyrinth?The fabric it is made of is very mfortable, and unlike any t-shirt I've worn.was a little scratchy at first, but after initial wash is better nowSuch a cute little sun hatI now air dry it which helps the side flaps hang straight a little better.This jacket has a flattering shape for my year old.The lace on the sleeve is very pretty and well stitched.Arrived quickly and good quality tie for the price and has a very light tie feel mparable to wearing a silk tie.The hat should have more sun protection ot the top of the hat.The sides can remain more open for olness.Comfortable sports bra that doesn't ride up or rub.I use these to do moderate to vigorous exercise and feel supported the entire time, seems to wick sweat away from my body well.Cute and super softNice sturdy at but some loose threads and was super starchy.Very nice and hefty necklace, nice earrings with the good plastic plugs.This headband was very gorgeous.Thankfully, the stone was loose in the package, so I'm just going to hot glue it in place before my wedding day.Other than that, for the price paid, this headband is gorgeousThese are really lovely and have been very beneficial to my meditations.Really well made with intricate beading.Very mfy shirt, excellent material: breathable and great on the skin.Great bulid quality, especially given the price.For me, this was a solid alternative, especially with its mineral glass face I'm very happy about that .. at this price one usually only finds polycarbonate, not glass).Keeps great time, looks hardre, and it looks/feels extremely rugged and expensive.Great dress, very cute and stylish.Very well made from what I have looked at so far.It was exactly like the photo and nicely made but sad it didn't fit.Great if you work in the restaurant industry.Fit mfortable.I double checked it was tton/polyester blend and got it it was tton and description had changed on all three I had ordered.These shirts run big, but are wonderful.The feel Is mfortable and nice look.I like that it's soft and warm.Not a fan of the cheaper snaps in the crotch but otherwise ok quality.Priced well for the quality.The Bohemian look,,Cute baby shoes.I like this necklace, it looks a little cheaper than I'd hoped it would.The chain is too bright, it definitely looks like a stume jewelry chain.Very pretty skirt but it is hard to iron/steam to get the pleats into place rrectlyGreat for the money fur Sur.This stume is a great value for a basic stume replica.The fabric is a little thin, transparent and small runs a little big, but you can adjust and it is nice shipping was very fast I remmend it for the summer.The quality was still good, just not the right direction )Seller and overall experience were very pleasant and without incident so A++ as a whole...The fur is very nice like the picture.I love earmuffs in the chilly weather.I first thought the stone had been enlarged for advertising purposes but was surprised at how nice the ring is.I received this product at a disunt price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.Great looking but they have a tendency to need adjusting when wearing.The clutch is beautiful and elegant.Buttons on the inside of the legs click together and make noise when I walk otherwise a great product.actually really well made for the price, money well spentThe material doesn't feel like it will last me years, but it seems like it will last me through several of my upming trips as long as I treat it rightI just wish the logo was in the chest area but other than that they are good quality.I will probably sew it together, since the other part wraps around and ties as well.Well madeQualitybeautiful earringssolid caseI'm usually not one to change out that particular piercing and have stuck to the original one I have but I'm so happy I decided to give this a try.I've had this piercing for nearly ten years and in time have forgotten my gauge so it was a bit of a tossup as to whether it'd fit and luckily for me, it did.The jewelry itself is great.Each ball unscrews so you can insert it which isn't my favorite as it can be a bit tricky and takes longer than my other but in time I'm sure I'll get used to it.Honestly I wanted to give it five stars and debated it but the only reason I didn't was because one of the balls won't show the diamond if you screw it as tight as you can.Otherwise, I love this jewelry.It's cute and matches a set of earrings I bought perfectly.The fabric Is soft,and decal is just as advertised I'm very pleased and can't wait for my son to wear it for his birthday.They look good, get the job done.Cute, classic flat.Great with jeans or shorts.Very mfortable and the silver is very prettyVERY COMFORTABLEI love that it's made with lightweight material and the fit is adjustable.It can be tricky to tie the straps together to secure it and it also is tricky to keep dry when you use in a pool because the sides are so floppy, but all in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.The design is ol and much less cheesy than the other options out there.Love the blouse.Now the blouse hangs perfectly and floats" when I walk.nice for my indian stumA little tricky to get it shoved under the seat for Spirit Airlines free personal item.They're decent enough pants to sleep in, but really should be cheaper.easy enough to fix by dragging the zipper pull all the way to the end, so for this reason, its not perfect, but definitely a decent bag.They were good designs though and item came on time.Everything as expected.If adjustable straps we're added, it would solve everything.I purchased this item for a s party and received a lot of mpliments.That's just a small issue, though and a matter of preference.Great delivery timeGreat weight to them as well.This necklace is decently nice.Otherwise love the shirt, looks great, and is a decent qualityI bought this dress to wear to a gala for work.They tend to curl out at the top making a seam lineThey are very mfortable tho.Don't understand your question about arch support.Material is forgiving, thicker than expected, and very mfortable.Pretty and very mfortableHe's so hard to buy for but when I saw this, I knew he'd enjoy wearing this during the chilly days or nights in.It's a nice change in his plain sweatshirt llection and adds a bit of fun in his mostly blank wardrobe.The material feels sturdy and I'm hoping he can wear this for many Christmas' in the futureI love Carhartt pants; they're mfortable and mostly long wearing.I'm willing to pay brand name prices for these because I know they're durable but is it too much to ask to take the mens carpenter pants and add a little bit of ease in the hip?Leave everything else the way it is but just make it easier for women to wear.Would appreciate if they were offered in different lengthsIt is % super cute, good thick material.I also bought a pettiat to add that 's flare to the bottom which really makes it pop.This is a lovely alternative to real leather, which I find too heavy for a purse.It is soft and natural looking, has both handles and shoulder strap and is the right size for me.I would have given it five stars if it had internal dividers to help keep the ntents better organized.Overall, it's a good value.This jacket is simply wonderful.It is unbelievably warm and soft.It's perfect for hiking or camping on lder days or even walking around town.The look works for many occasions.It is well-made, and the lining is very nice.Overall mfortable, but big.This was advertised as leather.I don't believe it to be real leather.The leather feels light and of cheaper quality, however, still a nice bracelet for the money.I am giving this stars because the quality uld be better but it is ultimately realistic when nsidering the price.It looks great on.Great top the lors are placed well for a slimming effect.Otherwise a very good workout topFabric is good, remmendedVery mfy, understated dress.beautiful, good qualityOther than that very happy with these he has worn them at the beach and in the pool.Fabric feels awesome and they're super mfortable.The fabric is nice-but suspect it will require a cami underneathI'll have it hemmed professionally and I'll have a dress that makes me feel stunning and sexy.love these pants, good work pants or to wear casually.It is beautiful and looks very classy.The material allows mfort no matter what season.They are excellent in mparison to the selling priceNice blend of fabrics has worn and washed well so far.I was very pleased with it quality for the priceI'd guess it was worth more than what I paid.I wanted to get my young niece something pretty, but wasn't sure how well she would take care of it because of her age, so the price was perfect for this set.The stones are tiny, but very sparkly.Fit just fine and I keep them clean so no tarnish or dislorationThis arrived with the picture centered but not as crisp as in the product photo.I have attached a picture so others can better appreciate what they are buying.Good quality and nice lor.Nice product, great that I can adjust the latches as I drop poundsThe price was pretty reasonable, and you can definitely tell why.The hooks themselves are very nice and the butterfly detail is cute.Just the lor I was looking for, but the gloves were a little too long in the fingers.Nice and stylish, but size was off a little bit.Happy with the purchase it is pretty.It protects them too with the soft furry lining.I got it to wear it around the house as additional isolation layer from the ld floors during the winter.I walk and move around all day long at my job, and these shoes are just perfect, very mfortable.Its breathable although a bit stiff.Good price and mfortable.I love the print on this tank top, and this is the send one I've purchased from Friendly Oak lovely designs).Not the material I was hoping for, but I guess it's okay.It is short, which is shown in the picture, but a delightful purchaseThis dress really works for petite women and it's easy to wear and not see-through at all.Excellent value, especially for the priceI love love love these little outfitsThey are soft and adorableIt adjusted well to my ntours and you can tighten it just the way you want for your bust, waist, hips, and love handles.They separated at the seams just trying them on- they looked amazing but the quality was lacking in the pair I received.Very cute and great quality.Great fit, good qualityLightweight great for working out.Clip feel strong.Good material, good fit.And a great price too.Not a great quality, of urse I didn't expect a Victoria secret for bucks )Material is stretchy so it's form fitted.However, a slip underneath takes care of any visible lines.Didn't hang right so I made it an ankle bracelet looks goodI gave it stars because it does have a lot of strings hanging off here and there that I had to cut off, but for the price, the quality is as expected- mediocre.Good for the purpose, a little see throughFine productReally cute summer dtess with strappy sandalsLook great in person.They are a great product.Its a perfectly nice little necklace.I thought the chain was a little long for my taste, but you can force the clasp through the other links to adjust the fit.The material feels pretty thick but is very stretchy so it's super mfortable.I super glued it back but other than that, its great and cuteThe scarf is a little narrow but is warm and soft.They really grip any surface and keep older people safe from slippery floors.Very BOHO and mfy.Just don't dry it and you should be fine.It's cute but not worth the price I paid.Good quality but some stitches a lil looseWell nstructed, good material, nice loose fit through the legs and rear.Only wish they were flared more for boots.Extremely cute.I love Cartel Ink's Tees I just wish they were a little longer.Other than that the shirt is a thin soft tton which I love, especially for the summer weatherIt doesn't glow as strongly as I expected it to, but it's a nice dark blue glow, and the design is elegant enough that I can feel nfident wearing it to work.These are really good shoes, and I hope that they last quite awhile.They are mfortable right out of the box, and look really good.Great Service and ProductBeautiful suit.But it does have good tummy ntrolThat said they are not perfect one popped off in a dressing room last weekend after getting caught on my scarf.It was a substantial tug though, so I felt it right

the quality isn't the greatest but still good enough.The lenses are plastic as is the frame however well-crafted and would certainly remmend at this price point When I received this, I was a little desappointed, because it looks like cheap jewelry, nevertheless, when I Tried my, it looks nice.Great shoe.Love this necklaceIt is very well made and a nice piece of geat, just wasn't exactly what I was looking for so I returned it.These leggings are super cute and mfy and my daughter loves the feel of them.The material is not what i expected at all.It's not stretchy at all, but it is very loose and pretty.It was loose and cute and mfy all at the same time.The material is different from the real shirts, but I like how it feels.Absolutely love itGreat, beautiful watch, but not waterproof or even resistant.Materials and nstruction are fine.Will probably look good with a light sweater over this.No straps.I haven't been in an environment where I sweat a lot others have said the adhesive

me of the ring easilyWarm, but breathable.These are very mfortable and well-made.Nice top for the officeOverall, nice headband but different that I thought it would be.It's really cute, and seems really well made.Very eloquentCute top, it is as I expected.Cute necklace--nice for summer.A nice thick material.Better for Fall or Winter.This shirt is very soft and mfortable.Loved it so much I just got it in olive too.The fabric is thinner than it looks, so it's better as a fall/spring low s) outfit and not so much for deep winter The Brocade shirt is lovely.The leather was worn down and smoothed out, and it's also beme much darker, so it looks like a different wallet, but still looks nice.Decent quality for the price as wellIt's mfortable and I can push up the sleeves when needed.The only problem I had with these was that it isn't a true crew neck like it is shown in the picture.Super cute and perfect for giftinggood quality too.Love this shirt, more importantly my husband LOVES itVery mfortable- I also hope it's durable unlike most clothes sold in recent years but it fits well- not too tight and not too loose depending on your body type.Good as a cheap tank.Very cute suit

the price it is just fine.They are super soft, and incredibly mfortable.Since these have zippers, hemming was less than desirable.I can't speak to them being water resistant, as I haven't had them wet.Not the highest quality item, but I will keep it and wear it with a pair of leggings.Good quality shirt and production.Very sturdy and cute umbrella.When arrived however, it was vered in a fine dust that meant I had to wash it all over before I uld gift it.Very cute, soft material, it faded in one wash but other then that it was perfectHusband loves this hat; wishes to buy another but I see

better for a younger, less wiggly stage.Has a seam down the back and the belt is not so great.But, the dress itself is great.everything I expected.There were a few stings inside I may need to trim and I don't know how well it will hold up to washing, but for one day I'm sure it will be fine.Very mfortable with stretchGreat looking, decent material.The fabric is very soft and washes well, does need ironing.The fabric is a bit thin but that is nice in the summer as she does not care for shorts.It's a cute mfortable dress.It was good quality, nice design.Very firm and sturdy look to it.They do the

good quality.I got the same bag navy blue) from Belk and the leather was much softer.I got nervous about the Velcro not sticking well at first but all is working fine now.I like the ability to adjust so many straps as I have narrow feet and as a teacher I appreciate the mfort of these.Cutie and simple good for work or day out.These are okay beads.We purchased them for our photobooth and they are fine for that.They look and feel a little plasticy but that's okay for our purpose.thought it would be a little warmerCould be a bit softer, but my son loves is Dino robe.Great price especially since it includes slippers.Very soft and warm.not the most insulated, but helps with staying warm while doing winter activities.It also helps to smooth and flatten the appearance of your stomach.I'm not sure about long term results because I've only been wearing for about . weeks.Overall, a good fit although I would have liked a bit more tummy ntrol in the mesh lining.Also, I wish the straps were

siline.Loved the fabric and lor but expected it to be larger.Materials are a little tacky but looks good ) I enjoyed wearing it for sureVery pretty and unique.They are very stretchy and soft.Kind of top bra.It is mfortable, stretchy and doesn't appear to get big wrinkles easily which is nice when in a hurry.They're amazing and look like the picture to a tee.The closure of the flap is a magnetic

pretty sheer and the lining is of stume quality but it works because it doesn't show.Nice quality and heavy duty.I'm not mad about that because it looks just fine when i use it to layer underneath my big scarf but not particularly the most attractive on its own.The stretched ear doesnt look good, but the earring is marvelous.Quality is fine, it's not tton if that's what you're thinkingVery happy with the design.This thermal underwear is warm underneath jeans and a sweater.Great fitting shirt.This dress is beautiful and figure flattering.The image quality was perfectThe sweatshirt material

fault of the maker, but since they are so sturdy there was no give in the jewelry to spread them to get to fit.The shirt itself is nice, its soft and mfortable.I love that it seems to ventilate well at the same time blocks the sun.The bust area is also a little lower than I was expecting, but it still vered the goods just fine.QUALITY/MATERIAL: This is literally the most mfortable piece of clothing I own now.The quality itself was really good, but the material makes the romper.Typical Kipling quality with professional finish.Phone pocket needs to be deeper.Rich and luxurious.The bag's outside flap is secured by magnets, but once you lift the flap, whatever is sitting in the open pocket is exposed yep, that includes the credit card slots).Again, this is a truly beautiful bag, but I stand by my mments above about the exposed credit cards slots.The light weight tton fabric makes this a perfect summer wrap.The enthusiasm is perfect for pairing with today's longer tops.This is a good quality garment.It's a beautiful gown and the back well there is no back.Good for the money.seen others stores less quality for about the same---some times have to try many different shoes but these fit right awayThis sweater is really beautiful.It is just a touch tight but can still be worn and as I am on a diet anyway, it will work for me.Why I bought this product: I was looking for stay-on mittens and socks for my newborn and these were cute.How the product worked: These mittens and booties are a bit pricey but they stay on better than ones without the velcro.I used these in the winter and they kept my newborn warm.His hands were wrinkly from sweat and his feet smelled from the sweat as well.I used thin tton mittens at home and saved these for outings.The velcro stays on and the thicker material keeps the baby warm.Yes they are not extremely sturdy, but they are inexpensive, but they are still nice and cute.It has good verage and a light breathable fabric.With that said they do stretch pretty well and I am able to wear them but I would have like them a little bigger.What do expect from a nation raised on turnips and mmie flakes?And I admire the overall quality and surprising mfort of this shirt.I am a recess aide and on my feet all day long.They are very lightweight and mfortable.I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are mfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem.I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first uple times of wearing them.They are mfortable, and I love them even more now.The glasses in general are great.Quality felt nice.It is good quality silver bracelet I do not really like the lock, it is very secure which is great, but not very pretty and hard to close by yourself once you put some beads on it, I always ask for help from my family.I remmend very much if you want one, but not wiling to spend too much on it.Haven't worn yet but really like itIts cute, light and fits good.Very cute outfit and extremely nicely made.Love the feel of the fabricWashes nicely and keeps it's shape and lor.I do love everything about it and will be purchasing a different lor one when he out grows thisNice, and of decent enough quality.Very nice product, quality, fabric and lor.Love this, it is a bit thin.It's cute and for how cheap it is, definitely a decent purchase.They look well made, are not too long,( in fact I am ' lbs and the length, with the elastic on the bottom, is perfect.).They have an elastic drawstring, which helps.They are also not very baggy, which I DID want for the surgery, but they look good, so I'm okay with them.Luckily you can tie the straps for a more mfortable fit but F your a DD you may be a little unmfortableIt is great just I did not like the quality But overall was perfect and kids loved itit's not too fragile.it has more detail than I thought it would.otherwise I'm happy with itThey maintain their ironed look without ironing.Loved this purchase and would def buy again, skirt was just a tad unmfortable so i had to wear it a bit higher but no harm done, i loved it.Band was little bit stiffy at the beginning, but it is something that is expected; after uple days of using it, it feels really fine on my wrist.I can deal the the suit not being lined, but not the bust area.However, that can create a flowy look that can easily be pulled off.However the material is pretty slick, so they do move around a bit, especially during a run.But nice to have a holiday shirt that was NOT a sweater, so I was mfortable and not overheated.well made, stylish, and simple.It's beautiful and high-quality like I me to expect from Patricia Nash.Perfect for my stume but a little expensiveGood material....As far as the quality goes, it's very soft and seems to be very well made.The rabbit on the front also looks very nice.its not a sweater but the material is still pretty thick so its a great fall/winter shirt.The ring is gorgeous and very shiny.I think the Asscher cut makes the ring look too clear and perfect and up close someone may suspect it isn't a real diamond.All the stones have stayed in place thus far.Fabulous BlouseNice vintage styleVery lovelyFits great and very mfy.Great customer service but the product needs a little attention if it wants to be sold to average sized Americans.Dress was made of very good thick quality.It was beautifulBut overall the dress was greatI was suprised by the great quality of the dress, it was better than I expected.This is the only bra I wear.It's mfortable and easy to get on and off.It is not as high quality, but for the price we were satisfied.Overall, it was a great purchase and my niece loves wearing it.So unique, and awesome looking.I bought one as a gift for a friend that has skin issues with metal watches.I do have the problem with the band breaking apart sometimes, but just a really good looking watch.It does NOT keep time well... but just a nversation piece makes it worth it.I only found that on the square face watches.Fine shorts.The drawstring is perfect and has enough give so that you don't have to struggle.Sturdy materialThis is very well made and mfortable.Worn for a few days and really happy with this purchase.Will be able to wear awhile before growing out of them.I

but it did not me with the watch it showed in the pictureI was pleased especially the price..Wire inside the tie ends in order to arrange them for optimal cuteness.Adorable fabric as pictured.They do not a little dim in daylight, but at night they are plenty bright.Also the material is good.These slippers are mfortable and can be worn for a long time even for someone with neuropathy.The dress itself is wonderful, nice material.Overall, it's a well made purse, and you get what you paid for.Quality of dress is way better than expected for price, washed about times over summer and retained shape, lors and is pill-free.It's a really good quality fabric and beautiful lor though.Prettt bracelet, great price.Comfy, breathy and stylish.And mfortableNice and mfy.Also, the jacket is warmer than expected.Nice material but way too short.This jumper is super mfortable.Liked the feel and weight of the fabric, I would have liked to reordered in a size up if it was availableIt's a good product.Nice quality bracelet; very pleasedThe quality fits the price.It's really damn warm though, so it's just what I was looking for in that regard.Over all, I don't feel upset or regretful of my purchase and I've worn it for about a week straight because the inside is so soft and warm.great mfortable shirt for hanging around the house and relaxing.these make great shirts to hang out in very soft and mfy.Not as soft as the originals back in the day...I loved these earrings.I love them, and they looked greatIt touches in the waist area but not above which is fine i still love it, but for me at least I was expecting something similar to a cardigan that I uld sort of wrap around myself.Well nstructed, but beware, it is very thick and quite heavy.This is my rd pregnancy the first time I've had to use support.These are the nicest active pants I have found though.Good thick material and stay up well during boot camp/tredmill style classes.They are long great as a layering item or sleep in ..Comfortable with stretch .. x is good if your a x in tops or a DDDExactly as it looks.The look is great and the material is soft.Very good nstruction.Looks wonderful.looked fine overall.Wasn't expecting high quality for the price.Will look great with jeans and booties for the fallWorks for what I needed: a travel, rain and sun hat.The fabric did not touch my skin.It is a lovely dress and I hope to wear it multiple times.Arrived earlier than anticipated, slightly snug at the chest area but overall i'm satisfied with the purchase, great quality.Different, cute, chain is nice length.Great cheap glasses.When washing, the pads move around a bit, but it should be fine if you're careful/ move them back in place.It has an Asian Indian look to it, that is why I bought.I wasn't sure how I would feel about a string bikini bottom but I love this swimsuitThe bottoms are a string bikini bottom but the top is long enough so I don't feel totally exposed.Very mfyI would of rated this purse a but nsidering I did not like the bow.It was removable so it was perfect.Summer sweater.Textured knitted fabricpretty ring, not as sparkly as the picture but ok stume jewleryThe clips aren't the best but do the trick.I love that the shirt actually gives my breast a nice lift, especially since a bra is not an option with this top.The fabric is pretty decent and no mplaints about the stitching.But for the price its deffinitely good.Perfect for the summer and casual settings, you can use the bands to fashion the top in many different ways.The prints and quality are just as advertised and potential buyers must pay go carefully over the sizing information.The material is not very high quality but nsidering the price, it is acceptable.The fabric has some stretch and is very silky soft.I wore it for hours and was quite mfortable the whole time.I have very sensitive skin and yet I did not experience any rash or itching after having the top on.The long bands also are quite stretchy and allow for a number of different styles in which one uld fashion the garment.This top is very fun and sexy for younger women, also appropriate and even kind of sporty for teenagers.The prints are vibrant and diverse.This is a great casual outfit perfect for casual settings and many other purposesOh, and btw, it looks amazing in photosAccurate description, well-made,

replace a broken purse, but it was more of a school bag then purse, so my daughter gladly traded me her working purse for this.its got a decent strap, holds things well and made with nice fabric that should last a few years.I'm giving it stars because it was VERY inexpensive and I wasn't expecting something absolutely spectacular.The material is super thin and prone to static cling but if you wear a slip underneath it's much better.This was exactly what I was looking for.The lors are vibrant, the fabric is soft and flows good.I haven't washed it yet so I'm not sure how it will hold up in the washer.Shoes fit my son perfectly and seem very mfortable for long time wear for play.I agree with the other reviewers that the seam of the liner uld have been finished better as you can see it

quality of fabric.Fun and sassy and oh so mfortable.Perfect for my fifties theme engagement photosI love the way these thin plugs extend outward more so than other siline plugs and hug" your ear.There is absolutely no fear of them falling out for any reason.In most other siline plugs I've purchased in jewelry shops there have been no burrs./ for fast shipping, good price and decent quality.The material is thin so I wouldn't necessarily use this as a walking around t-shirt but definitely works well as a sleeping or workout T.The material is really nice.The material is nice and stretchy and

modifications.But for this excellent disguise.I really liked how it looks and feels my only problem is that I had to tight two of the straps on the sides that fit too big but other than that it's perfect and great quality.The Opel can pop out is not securely placed it every single time you get one.Other than that the pieces beautiful well nstructed.Is really good for working out in also and

soft.Tgey are really pretty as scarves though so I decided to wear them for their intended use.Bought of these for my Grandsons and they seem well made but they are pretty dark; I would call it charal and not Brown.The leather does not scratch easy which is a plus.This is a great bag if your looking for just a handbag like a tote.Lots of space, fited my purse, a in bag, oz glass water bottle, hand lotion, hand sanitizer, a little travel note book and still had some room left.But great imitation people leather.Nice and sturdy will hold its shape and have frets on the bottom so there won't be

Amber beads/stones and when I lost my favorite bracelet I opted for this one.Its beautiful and exactly like the picture.Overall it's a nice ring just wished they had rings more suited for female vets.Material is not that great but OK, can't mplaint for the price it offered.It wrinkles easy and is not very easy to iron due to the material makeup.After some alterations and taking it to the drycleaners to get the wrinkles out, it will work nicely.It would be nice if the fabric were a little thicker and more durable.I have the rose lor and my gem fell out already once so it had to be

great for nearly two weeks.Great flannel shirtFabric feels warm and light.Not sure how it helps as a mid/base layer for winter.This shirt fits really well but there is no care label on it.Very soft and nice looking T-Shirt.It definitely finished off the look.High quality product.They look well made and came quickly.Durable and AdorableThis dress is really nice but the material is then I would remmend because the detail is gorgeous I wore it with shorts and killed it it was lovely for meNice quality but not sure why these were priced as high as they are.Great shirt good value It's like

getting used to but they keep my ears warm don't fall offI'm Jamaican so this is perfect for beach parties which are kept on a regular here.I was looking for a inch straight line black dress skirt and

wellThis is very pretty and mfortable.Satiny feeling and roomy.If it does well after being laundered, it will be perfect.Decent quality wore for a baby shower.Extra cute novelty garmet, great transition piece between to wear between seasons.my husbands last wallet was bursting at the seams, this wallet took some time getting organized, almost everything fit.They are mfortable light and cute.there is a strap, when i purchased these the picture did not show a strap and i told the seller i received shoes with a strap but they didn't seem to care.Looks a lot more expensive than it is and I have had a lot of mplements.Looks good and distributes weight evenly.Cannot be worn alone as a dress but love the material and flow.Loved the skirtPerfect for layering.The craftmanship looks good, the skirt looks greatVery delicate and lovely ear vines.really pretty and spectacular."It was a little roomy but mfortable.My great granddaughter loved the sparkle shoes and put them on during her birthday party.Lacing up the back was challenging, but we did it.Very beautiful and looks just as picturedBut otherwise, it looks great.I gave it stars because I was surprised at the quality.The elephant pendant is removable as well.I had to put on a little cami to make sure it wasn't too much cleavage, and I did have to adjust the wrap around my breasts a few times a day, because it's not sewed in place.Holds on to wrinkles a lot, so you'd have to iron or steam it.We own a tons of drool bibs since my son drools a LOT and these are far better than using a regular bib.They're thicker than regular bibs as well, and the snap in the back makes them more secure than the velcro versions.Love the strapsIf the fabric was a little bit softer they would be even better.Very attractive.These actually do not look all that stumey up close, and I didn't buy them for a stume; in fact I bought them to wear around the office.Step off the nveyer belt of popular thinking, and be the change you want to see.These have a steady rise, and are therefore much easier to walk in.I absolutely love the style of the shoe and wear them for my gym workout.The arch support is great so they are extremely mfortable to walk/run on, but they are incredibly narrow.If you hate your shirttails rising up and sticking out its definitely worth the clean crisp look you can maintain throughout the day.Good

stunning.Great insoles at a reasonable price.This is one f my favorite scarves, the lor and length are perfect.It was fine she likes for cheap jewelry wears them both lorsthey are mfortable and hopefully long lasting.The only reason I didn't gI've it a five is because of the material.A bit shinier then I would have liked and a little to polyester filling.The dress is greatI don't know how long it will last once it has been washed a few times, but the price is fair for the quality that you get.They look perfect together.Comfy and warm.Have ordered these dresses twice for stuming and really like them the material is fairly thick and drapey and soft for the price, and they seem pretty well-made.To be honest it's not very mfortable though its really long and awkward and gets caught on everything but luckily I only have a few weeks left in my pregnancy before I can go back to regular navel rings.It's beautiful and looks just like the picture.However, the band is mfortable and easy to use.The dress is of very good quality material stitching is great.Great price for a wardrobe stapleExcellent quality but too small for a mans head.Quality and price get stars.Very cute and easy beach ver-upGood Quality but thought it was a bit largerThis is one of my son's favorite shirts.I didn't give it stars because I haven't yet washed it, so I don't know how it will hold up.Otherwise, great.Comfortable and stylishStill, good value for the price, and very nice looking as well.It is a beautiful shirtIt was delivered within business days and in perfect ndition.The fabric

pieceSeems to well made and very sexy feeling.Nice and good quality for the priceLooks ol but somewhat of a tough fit since it wobbles a lot.Product looks like the picture, it is really nice and feels good on.The quality has some flaws the ribbon on the side came off just from putting it on, but overall and for the price it is worth it.These shirts are light, ol and mfortable.The skirt is great because it's super mfy/stretchy, but still looks tight.Really pleased with this itemNice style, they have a lorful effect when direct sunlight hits a surface which gives some unique visuals.Other than that the quality is extremely good, and very cute.Not sure how good the material would hold up in salt or chlorinated pool water but I'm not of a swimmer anyway.It's definitely beautiful though and well worth the priceBut other than that, good quality gloves for the price and appear to be made well.They are mfy and feel like they will hold together well.They are not very dark but look like I have a bad bruise that is visible under the light peach fabric.Quality matches the price and I do not expect to get years of use out of it.Arrived on time and was beautifully presented.I love wearing it all day and at night.I feel stronger, clearer, and more grounded.Has held together well.It's cute and easy to wearLove this top, so cute and mfortablenice tton stretchy fabric.It looks great on me.Overall, it's still a great little dress, and I don't mind having to do extra alterations because its SO CUTEGreat quality and pretty true to sizeLove the pockets.This is a very pretty backpack.It has sturdy nstruction and I just love the lorsNice for the money, but don't expect them to last very long.I had bought the Roll on Body Glue and brought it with me and add it to the underside to keep it on until the party was over.Love them besides the zipper on all pairs I've gotten break within a uple wears.A beautiful, inexpensive piece with minor flaws like dried excess glue peeking out).This is a pretty cute top for the priceThe jacket is a shiny, satiny fabric.i give it star because the sizes are inaccurate other than that material and design is very nice.Just the right amount of padding.Great tankiniIt's very cute but it's very see through.I'm looking for a slip to wear under it and then I think I will love itFit well, but I liked another dress I had ordered better.Their really good but their just really see threw and unmfortable so if you want mfortability these aren't for you but they look like the real thing and I love themOnly stars because haven't been in the water yetVery warm with multiple uses.super mfy, love the tall waistband.Definitely cuts the glare but they are a bit too dark for me at night.Super cute, mfortable, and nservativeThe lor of leather is a rich brown and matches so many things.The more you use it and the leather relaxes it does give to a bit more opening.But overall it needs to be wider.This is a very nice top but I didn't like the way it looked on me.I absolutely love these earrings.I love the beads but I uld have just purchases a string a beads and done it myself since that's what I had to do to fix the clasp.Really pretty hematite and my husband loved it since he didn't have to fix it, meeeehhh.Very long, otherwise reasonably well made.Wish the elastic band was a little more substantial but they are just fine.Other than that it's perfect but for a prego it definitely not mfortable when it's degreesThe material looks and feels like real leather, without the price tag.This dress is Beautiful.Great design and nfrotablesome of the stitching is a bit messy but I love the look fit of this jacket.its also nice and warm.It fitted very well, but the watch it very delicate, don't let it fallSoft on the inside and

such a low price.HAHA, enjoy ) (ps- my inner cartilage on the ear in the pic is pierced- that's not dirt or something hahaha)Super softGood quality shorts at a good price.Very warm and so soft around the neckThey looked great and were super mfortable.Very mfortable, would buy again )Unfortunately they are loose now so i'll have to tighten them, but they really helped keep the sun out of my eyes.StringsFun little pieces of jewelry for the ladder of piercings along the entire outer portion of my right ear.Again, I wear it all the time including in the water.The back of it is a but loose because there is extra material so don't expect a perfect fit like a dress.I like the ties on the side it gives it a nice feminine touch.It's modestAnd mfortable.The straps are still attached and in working order.The wheels are fairly quiet which is nice when I'm rolling down the hallways at work.My only real mpliant is that there was no care for instruction included with the garmentI bought this

exactly like the quality you pay for, but it passes really well for a simple addition to a casual outfitSeems to be a nicely made product.The buckle is a little shinier than I expected, but still looks good, and everything works well.Nice mfy sweatshirt.I have gotten mpliments every time I have worn it.Loved the ruffles at the bottom.It's a good hat, not stiff enough, but it's Okay.My daughter lovers her robeIt appears to be real leather exterior and the lining fabric is better than most.With that smell I'll be assured never to lose my purse, just follow the smellIt's kinda perfect for Florida weather which is where I live) the material looks high quality and it's stitched beautifully.But the glasses or beautiful The case is great well optics work well if you can keep them on your nose.It held everything I needed it tooI will say though that this is certainly great quality for a replica and a great priceThe zipper also seems a tad bit cheap so I would definitely remmend being gentle with it and not over-stuffing the bag.Overall the bag is so cute that I can't stop taking pictures of it and perfectly bridges my needs for practicality, novelty and style.So many pictures below:I'm not sure if this is a flaw on all, but it's definitely worth mentioning.these are acceptable socks for the price; a bit thin for winter wearFor that money I feel the zipper uld be a bit more wearable.Good quality, true to size.Not remmended to wear all the time.Quite stretchy which also means a body shaper is remmended to smooth out any lines.I was expecting some level of support with all those straps, but since they're such light elastic, there wasn't much at all.I'm not sure if I'll be able to wear it out in public, but it's really mfy for around the house.No clasp which is mfortable.As far as the quality goes- it is as expected.That being said, we bought these becausee we like the quality, fabric and weaarability.They are a good product.Durable.Nice outfit, the material uld be a little bit more quality, but it's still pretty nice.good cap for the pricePerfect shape, lor well made well priced.so cute but scratchyand bad material but when i put it on my daughter it actually looked nice the shirt was a great material n cute fit it was to ld for the shorts that day but the shirt is very cuteYet still a great pair of quality pantsOverall it's pretty great.Great durability and size for the most part.Great buy for the priceNice anklet jus had it for ah few day so don't no about the fading yet...but for d price it's okLike it but it's tangled easilyMmmmmm...Soft and mfy.Great product for the price.They look good thoughthe rings are pretty and i get mpliments all the time on the lorful oneAbsolutely beautiful.Very nice but wish it was a little better quality... As a Vietnam Helipter Crew Chief/Gunner.it will serve it's purpose.The waist isn't big, It fits just right when I put it on, but the material is somewhat too sleek that it rolls down over the cause of time or as you move.Cute, great price and quality.Nice make up bag, but I wish zipper is better made.Zipper is not smooth.They are ver with fabric, which is nice, but they are a bit too big and heavy fit the stitching used.Came in great ndition, and is still in great ndition, no loose stitching.Artwork is fantasticI wish it was a little longer, but most Hawaiian shirts are cut short.It is really mfortable and very sexy.No underwire but the straps do get to hold the girls mfortablyI thought this was definitely a steal even though I had to add a little bit of extra fabric, but I will definitely buy another one since it is the most sexiest bra top I ownThe scarf is just what I expected and desired.It is soft and mfortable as advertised.It feels as if some is cradling the goods.They are mfortable, keeping everything in place.I am unhappy about the delivery being several days late, and I feel maybe if you got two pair this would be worth it.My wife loves these shirts.Very soft and don't shrink with waking and drying.My wife was even able to wear it mfortably while pregnant without stretching it out.The Mocs are beautiful and well made.I just have to reserve wearing it for times when I'm not self-nscious about people seeing my entire bootyThe craftsmanship is also very good, it seems like a well-made garment.Great looking, light frames.the hinge is very durable, but the plastic nnection between the temples to the frame is dubious.In some places the metal attachments don't look too great up close, but otherwise it's a cute outfit and can be worn to a store or casual setting.Seems like it is decent quality.She finds them mfortable.I loved this dress, it had good detail and was good quality.Other than that, they keep my hands warm at work nicely; I have a desk job and I don't move my hands much but I type a lot and these are perfect for that.The fabric is not the best quality, but for the price its perfect.Beautiful...Fits just like the picture and I'm so in loveNice quality,fits well, but be aware it is very low cut.Love it..looks like the pic and metal is vibrantCoat is very cute and I get many mpliments.Very mfy shoe, a little longer than expected but probably the shape of the toe adding to this feeling.Maybe a little expensive for canvas shoes but mfort is great.Great insoles with excellent arch support that I use in multiple shoes for multiple activities.You might have to trim them a little depending on the shoe you're wearing them with but that's easy to do with a good pair of scissors.great product but a bit shortI woul have to place my hands over my package,if I were to use these on the beach.I got it cheaper here on Amazon then I saw this same top in a department store for a lot more.Maybe credit card and lipstick that's about itI misplaced my wedding ring and bought this as a hopefully) temporary place holder The price was definitely right, and it shines beautifully, much like my mother's white gold wedding band.This ring is very heavy however, it really is a substantial piece of jewelrySo it might not be a good choice for those with more dainty fingers, but especially for men who want a solid feeling band, you will like this ring.It doesn't boost my itty bitties very well but I do love the way it fits my body other than that.Nice abs perfect for a gif.Nice material i ordered a medium but they sent a large don't really mind tho still an awesome shirtI love the sexiness of the top.Other than that, the lor is perfect.I wore it yesterday out on a boat)for the first time and found it very mfortable.It is a bit thin and there is no liner which wouldn't be a problem if I was wearing this as bike shorts but I purchased it for the beach.Looks great on me.Cool earrings..didn't really glow though.Really ol but be obviously aware it's a little fragileMy month daughter wore these for several hours a day, over a week while we were at the beach.They were perfect for her to walk around the pool deck without slipping and through the sand.The shoes held up greatThey dried within a few hours if they were in the sun.They look greatBut after only a few times worn, they started to great on the top part.Very good quality, but not sure if the adhesive tape is strong enough to hold....Expensive shipping and though mes with normal post with no protection.It's great for carrying just a few items.Love this walletThe material and lens are as described, metal and polarized.Will buy again in the future as a replacement for more expensive brands like Maui Jim or Ray Bans.Very nice and soft for my mom's head....Nice quality and the material lays wellI found this to be a high quality and sturdy product.Feels like a stume hat.Sparkle like real diamond She loves the designs and mfort.Beautiful blouse that generates mpliments every time I wear it. stars because the material does not breathe, but otherwise is great.I wash it on the delicate cycle and hang to dry, no problems with wear tear, it is well made.I expected better fabric qualityDecent pajama.Warm and mfortable.The material is thicker than I expect and very nice.Looks great nowSO COMFYIt was kind of thick and can be unmfortable but if you stretch it out enough it feels and looks fine.Nice and warm for inside use.like soft soled moccasins with little rubber feet".It is very elegant.High quality material and workmanship.I feel like the overall quality wasn't great for such an expensive pair of underwear.It didn't hold up as well as my bulk package of Fruit of the Loom or Hanes underwear, which I can honestly say that I prefer.Great, mfy shirt.Super cute, but classy earrings.I am ' " and the length was a little too long but other than that I love it.I got a lot of mpliments on it and it was very sturdy and nvenient when i had bad hair days lol.Alright quality, This review is being written a year and a half of using the product, Which only recently was thrown away.I am excited to use this product for future

BeltThankfully it's roomy enough that he should be able to wear it for years to me.It is a great buy for the money and looks great on.I would remmend this but for myself prefer the one which is a bit more expensive from Amor.Cute, lightweight, and nice denim quality.Comfy but runs a little large.I used this inexpensive crossbody bag at Disney for our -day trip.I can't imagine it would hold up to everyday use for long periods of time, but if you switch your purses out or just need it for a trip, it should do the trick.The shirt is almost perfect.It's very soft and the alien is stitched into the fabric not printed on.I love this bag but the picture made me think the studs where gold, but it still pretty I get lots of mpliments on itNice lors easy to drape.super cute, can feel heavy/scratchy on a really hot day.If you live in a mild climate, it's a great suitI have many pieces.The top itself is very pretty and better made than some other iHeartRaves products.Comfortable,

as you would in the winter.Missing one stone but very nice.Not as nice as the picture... but it is still an amazing warm and adorableare removable, which means you can also add chicken fillets in there for a stume if you need.The lour is great, and I love the little see through mesh bits throughout the bodice.The gathered ruffles make it very flattering on the figure, and the price makes you

way too large for my teen; has to return.For the price these are greatBut it looks greatGreat price but you get what you pay for.very beautiful and and practical however the lor of the silver loop is much brighter than in the pictureThe product is clingy and there is a mild odor on it but shipping is really fast.Only gave it a star because the nstruction of it makes it a little flimsy, but it really does look like the Grimm key and that makes it a wonderful llectible for the price. but these aren't problems that can't be fixed easily.It is very soft and flowy and hits right at my ankles, Im '.They smell like metal so I'm very sure they have knickle in themThe jacket itself has a padded insulation and feels a bit poofy, but is mfortable once you get used to it.This jacket seems suitable enough to keep me warm all winter without a problem I live in Southern Arizona but I haven't fully tested it out in the ld yet.I had to wash it three times before the smell was bearable.Overall a good buy for the price.They seem very well made and sturdy.The fabric is very thick and warm.Overall, fairly nice productGreat build quality otherwise.Great dress for the priceNice

designOther than that it's a great price.These shorts are very mfortable and not too short.Better nstruction on the closing clipThis dashiki is so pretty it's just like the picture it's just that the material is silky Very warm, waterproof, and firs as expected.They've done well during many hours of playing in the snow.Very lorful stones altogether its a beautiful pair of earrings.The making looks good.I would say this is the best strapless bra you can get for the price, but price aside, its a steal and a great find.Socks do not stay on heel, but love verage on the front of foot.Cute and very soft.My eldest had a Lightning McQueen pair, they fell apart in the end but it was after a good amount of hard wear and for the price I am happy enough.Very ol, and water resistant, but I uldn't see myself hiking all day in them mfortably.Perfect summer wearI wish I had more support in the chest area.They are great running socksthe material is good I love it, im pretty short so its like a normal short cute dress to me but it was really worth the spendingI received it yesterday shipping was fast} and love the design hoping it will shrink a little after washing.The material is stretchy, and it has a silkier feel than what I was expecting, which is good.Pants material is fabulous, but my frame is not within the size chart listedPretty necklace for the price.I plan to glue it back on and hopefully that will work.After a few washings, the lettering has faded somewhat, but it still looks great.Smooth material and a great fit are the most you can ask for in a tshirt and this shirt has itHopefully it won't me off again, or I might have to glue it down.The hooks are also a little bit wobbly mpared to my own purse hook, which seems to be a bit heavier and better quality.They are a great buy for the money overall, despite the minor issues.and fake looking, i'm giving it a because the earrings were nicely madeMade well, no fraying, the bow was secure, they fit wonderfullyIt is more orange than red but I love it still its super soft and going to be extremely warm when it gets ld enoughLovely dress- but surprisingly short.A little more booty advertising than I expected, but

thin, but my daughter just wears a tank top underneath and loves it.They are effective and I think they look nice on me.They are not the densest fleece, so I do not think they would be great for really ld weather.But they are stitched well and are cute.Looks good on tooIt is infinitely easier than chasing the sun.Not as cheap" as the sun but much more user friendly.I love the material, and the price was perfectAll in all, we had them all tailored and loves the priceNot necessarily any warmer than my older gloves of average quality so I am also little disappointed about that.The wallet is spacious and attractive- holds a lot.Glad I was able to straighten it out without breaking the post off.The dress arrived clean, wrapped in plastic and in perfect ndition.I'll pair it with Ralph Lauren Cecelia denim shantung wedges.Great for a guys, a little big for the ladies but overall was happy with the purchase and look.Looks exactly like the pictureI washed it with hot water and added apple cider vinegar to the detergent.Now I wash it in a gentle load.Its not quite as green as I wanted but it is soft and beautiful.The top fits great and even has a metal hook/clasp at the back which I love since plastic ones do not last in sun and chlorine.Lint magnetLove the feel of the fabric.I love the description, fast delivery and great packagingThey are great for the price.Have machine washed multiple times and air dry and they hold shape well.Not an expensive piece but pretty and one of those things perfect for everyday wearI wish the straps uld be adjusted up.This dress has a lot of stretch to the top as wellI purchased the mermaid scale leggings in green.Love the print and the quality of fabric.Nice Shades.Good QualityIt looks great thoughChain broke before the end of day one but the pendant is niceIt fits okay at first, perhaps a bit loose, but after a while it stretches a bit and is just too loose to be that mfy.Adjustable so my boyfriend and I can share it.Otherwise we love itLightweight, good verage, and would buy againThey are warm and zyIt's not as loose as it looks on the model, but it's not tight very mfortable.But it's a great sweater.Items arrived as expected and look good.The little emblem kind of wore off fairly quickly but other than that they are a great value.They are pretty cuteExcellent fit for my wife.I'll wear it with my thin shirts the navy with thicker shirts.My pockets are just fine on both vests.They look very nice and will work great for my wedding.Other than that, good product.Other than that it's decent for the price.Feels like a quality flannel shirt.The fabric is interesting, in a good way.It is very smooth and almost slick and doesn't cling to the skin, thank goodness.The back detail on this shirt is amazing.These are soft and really mfortable.Be sure to wash these on delicate or do not dry so they last.Good value, nice sleek case.I cut that off and haven't had problems since.It needs an anchor bead to keep it in the right direction.perfectNonetheless, this is an amazing price for three pairs of earrings.They do stretch a bit more than expected, very mfortable.Nice all around trousers.It looks very nice, but I find it too thick and way too heavy for my taste.Nothing wrong with the ring at all, just not my preference.Very affordable.Product arrived on time, and looked as described.Works well, it has some ol lights that every yo would enjoy.He loves this hat, it is not adjustable which would be nice since he had a Mohawk but he still fits it on his headSo easy to slip into and mfy, and the shape is generally nice trim.In black it will be perfect.I have another Rekucci pencil skirt as well denim) and overall I'm impressed with their products.Still great buy and love it.This was so perfectThe first day I used it I had yoga pants on and a tank top and that alone made me look very delicate and summer-y.The only things I wish were slightly different, is a more stiff back, so it stands up straight on its own a little better.But it's a great purchase regardless.LOVE Loungefly products.Its cute for the price, its a very chunky piece, but cuteI did expect them to be a shinier material, they are tton.it's a great quality swimsuit but for short body type.Simple and works.The fabric was nice and thick although the skirt is a different fabric then the leggings Excellent looking western style belt.Attractive buckle and details and quality.Material on the bottom half is quite thin but very flowy and top part fit quite well.Slightly see-through/thinner material than I expected, but I love itIt's one piece.Good belt but not quite what I wanted.That's not me, but I love zebra prints so I bought them anyway.Great for working long hours in triple digit heat.The material is very light, breathable and durable.It worked great and kept her warm on a chilly trick or treat night.The shirt is excellent though.Very nice, some of the buttons were starting to fall off but the dress is beautifulWore these a uple of times and they seemed to hold my earrings in place well.Good quality for the money.They're really mfy and perfect for Southern California winter'.She said its so very mfortable.Now this sucks for me because yes we have both gotten bigger and I'm trying to find mfortable clothes for me to wear at a reasonable price, but they don't fit right and they for her.This style of clothing, the one that catches my eye is expensive but you can see that its made bigger.But for this one, the material is very soft, and flowy to feel.I just had issues with my chest area in this dress so I uldn't wear it mfortably.It looks sharp and is very mpact.For the price it is actually a very good mask putting it on it fits so well and is very scaryNothing wrong with the item itself that's just life.Great Quality, very pleased, but a little too long.soft and mfy.A little more translucent than I would like but... overall happy w/the purchaseOtherwise very nice boots for the price.My daughter is pleased with these cleats.They do turn her feet blue when the field nditions are slightly wet from morning dew.I was disappointed but my husband pointed out the level of wear - hours of practice a week, plus games).Good product and good price.A nice product and rrect fitting.Dishonored makes it look like you have a uch but it is definitely good under underwearLove the product, material is nice but fragile.Of urse, as expected at such a low price, the chain is poor quality and won't look great for long but I don't regret my purchase since the price is so low.Happy with this product.I wish the leather was softer.great value.These glasses have solid protection from sunlight and I have had many mpliments on wearing them.Great glasses for the value.Nice material and good quality.I loved this bag.But its a very nice good quality bag.Nice soft fabric, and seems well made.Nice quality with embroidered detail that was accurateGreat blouse.These are great quality just run small, will need to exchange for a larger sizeI wish it was thicker and wish the hinges didn't have as much play from side to side.Be aware this sweater is made out of mixed fibers so it is not the greatest in quality, but works for casual wear.great gag gift for people who don't like wearing seat belts.They have a very clear dial an adjustable watchband.Another great feature is they also have a send hand on the watch which is great for timing them while they brush their teeth.I have stacked it with other rings and it looks good.I have another Tungsten ring and I love itmfortable, and classy cktail dress casual dress the tummy ntrol is not too tight but you can adjust the lengthIt sometimes gets caught in my hair and needs a little getting use too but is a great product for the price.The bracelet looks great, but some of the joints do not move freely.Lovely looks exactly like the photoThe quality of the earring thus far is very good.Beautiful dress that is a nice weightIt flows perfectly and is very figure flattering.Otherwise they seem good.Well made, good organizerThe material was pretty good too.nice for the price and pants haven't fallen onceToo thick, but decent looking.Well built and pretty ring.Really keeps you warm, and was thicker than expected.These undies are super soft and mfortable.I also bought black DA trunks at the same time as these, they are fine...and have been washed together with these every time.They're great plugs, nice quality, but more yellowish with blue than the opaque/white I was hoping they'd be.Overall, the product is pretty good.I love the Logo and the quality.Anyway, great quality from CafePress.Not to warm, not too light.I can wear it all day long.Very nice productNo tears or runs... a solid pair of tights that will be kept in my tote of stumes for future spirit wear outfits.Overall, I was happy with the product.Also, the sequins are a lot brighter in person than in the picture.The quality of the shirt is good.The shirt can be worn during the day or even for a night out.Very soft inside, my son wants to wear it nstantly.I love this show and I love this shirt it is so mfy I would wear it all day if I uldAmazing lookThis is perfect for holding my cards.Great price, mfortable and cute.Very mfortable over the ears, and very warm.A nice material and good quality.It was a bit wrinkled when I received it but I pressed it on a lower heat setting and it was fine.The material is very sheer yet soft and mfortable.I love the dress and its mfortable.good quality and fast shipping.Perfect if you don't want to overdo the turkey theme.The bag it's smaller than expected but I feel as if the overall quality is extremely nice.This is a nice tube top.It is made of nylon and I would like to have a tton one as they are more mfortable in our humid weather.Overall, it's nice though.Still adorable and the extra fluff will be extra insulation.Brim is just the right width for both sun protection and, later this year, rain protection.Quality fabric, I would buy again.Make sure you wash it before you wear it.Once it gets washed and dry for the first time the jumper will be fine to wear.I taped it up and still use it though.The material is kind of thing, but perfect for summer or for honeymooncute socks and my grandson loves them.So far, good for the price.Fair Quality for the price; I feel they are a good way to check out whether you want to go clipless on an mtb w/o too much investment.The pedals are working fine, but take some adjustment out of the box, and some getting used to.Seems well made but didn't look right with my figure.Hat provided a stylish sun shade for summer outings.Great quality, lor is exactly as the picture shows.It seems like it might not be the most resilient but we'll see.This seems to be a good quality slip/dress.It is opaque with nice lace trim and will work well for me as a long camisole.Not see through drapes nicelyI love it but Im ' and even with heels it was a drag.They are nice, but I just wish they were made a little bit looser to give some breathing space especially around the arms and legs.I only give stars because I have to cut some kind of strings hanging; the stitches are okay.Very happy with this item.The fabric isn't great but for I am not mplaining, and don't mind the fabric at all.But they work fine, so long as you are not wearing them on very delicate fabrics.Beautiful sweater.I can't believe the quality for this priceLove these earrings.Sturdy plastic replacement for walletThe skirt is a bit long but otherwise I love it.Perfect for swimming and the beach without showing so much skinNice shades, not very sophisticated, yet, its a nice everyday pairjust as expected just waiting for super ld arctic air to get in some good use this winterThe hat band does not look substantial, but I'll check it out soon enough.Otherwise it looks greatOverall good product, great price.The top is so padded.I am loving this brandMade nicely.I wish, based off of my measurements that were given before purchase, there was someone that would have been able to give me accurate advice.chain broke off after week of use, its okay since i thought the chain looks a little cheapy but overall Im still satisfied with my purchase.It's a cute nightgown.The pantyhose appear to be standard quality.Shorter and width than the picture but beautiful and good quality anywayGreat fit and quality for the priceIt is definitely not a high quality or authentic stume, but is great for a one time wear.The way you adjust the straps isn't fantastic, and the ends of the straps just kind of hang.Just to note, it's made from a velour type of material.Comfortable, but not substantial at all.This is a beautiful ring although a bit thick.Very mfortable fitting.The inside is fuzzyBetter quality and hopefully it will survive the test of a few monthsIt's not too bulky, vers well.Nice cut.Good graphic on T-shirt, and the material is soft tton.Comfortable, great to jog in.The product itself is good and sturdy.I just wish there was a childproof lock to keep them in place.Pretty blouse.good cheap checkbook versI actually like the hat, but gave it to a friend that has Beautiful Locks to wear on her head.Very nicely nstructed and sassy.Very happy with it, top just a lil to loose but I like it.Overall great product.Bag is lovely one star less for fishy smellIt is very mfy.The seeds and the medallion are beautiful.These are very cheap pearls, but they served their exact purpose.They're simply stume jewelry but I was pleasedNeeded some stume jewelry for a retro themed Hollywood glam even and this fit the bill and a deep disuntIs beautifulI am really love it, was perfectLove the suite, it's very cute, seems to be well made and a great fit everywhere except the bra.It is nice enough to break away from the look of traditional pearls from time to time Pearls are my normal go to' jewelry of choice).I thought it would be a little more sparkly, especially since there is more metal than pearls.However, it is a good weight and lays in a classy way.One star is deducted for some of the links not being finished and smooth.Perfect for the priceBeautiful my wife looks good in themNice material for the priceStylish and good price.If you have thick thighs I would nsider another product.I needed them quickly for a last minute stume for that these were perfectAfter I fixed it No problems.I wore it for three events an adult party, a family party, and to work and received mpliments at each.Great nversation pieceNice material very ol but also keeps the warmth in when getting out of the shower.but a little more material would be nice for me, if your somewhat smaller it's probably ok.The material is soft and true to the lors.I'd give them an extra star if they gave an upgraded option of same model shirts in a better quality material with a finer mesh.nice for the priceVery pretty and light material.Nice and roomy.not a jaw dropping stone but a decent cut and lor for the price may make a nice ringI am incredibly happy with this cardiganThey are super mfortable and I wore them on a day canoe trip a uple of weeks ago.Great shirt, DKNY quality.Other than that and some minor threading issues.Silky, lightweight.These pants were much nicer than I was expecting for the price.Great shirt, great price.The look and feel are great.They were fine, but we're not fancy enough for the jewelry I am making.I liked it though, gives it a funky look.The paper airplane looks better than the infinity necklace.The price is good though.(has to be the same) Top is definitely mfortable.These are a really nice quality item, nice texture.Yah she solidnow, let's see how well they hold their shape and only time will tell~Good basic insole.Not as supportive as my Vionic.The zipper on this one better then older versions.There are lots of pockets and zippered pouches and slots to stash things.I am usually sensitive to smells and the clutch does not have a strong odor.Not a lot of give at the top for larger legs but can be worn as anklets.This is exactly what I was looking for.It hangs loosely around my body while still cut in a feminine and flattering shape.The pockets are at a mfortable spot for my hands.My only mplaint is that I am worried the fabric will pill, but I can update you all on that later.Silk/see thru materialVery nice pendant.I use it daily and it makes for a very mpact minimalistic appearance.The Craftsmanship is average.Overall good purchase for the price but, keep in mind that the garments shrink, bleed and fade.Great shirt, very warmHaving said that, I have yet to wash it so I will do it in ld and hang dry it again, per other reviewers suggestions).Finally, they are really stylish.broke multiple times before event.. but easy to fix and once looks really good onSmall crack on lens but doesn't bother from both views but overall wonderful productThese toddler socks are very thick and warm.I wish they had grippy bottoms and they snag very easily, but they are a good quality fabric so the snags are unattractive but the socks are totally wearable stillSeems to be the same quality as the shirt we bought at the park.It is a nice, thick tton that should last through many washes.Quality is nice too.The cross pattern in the back is sexyThe material is soft and it hold up well in the wash. No mplaints hereThese are well nstructed My only mplaint is that they're bind into my ankle area and feel too tight otherwise they offer good support overallThe build quality of the hat is good.Comfy and classy, but for the life of me I can't get them to sit just straight...This dress is simple and at the same time cute and sexy I really like it but is a little bit shorter than I expected but is nice just Don't bent when you are using it jajaj.However, I'm really tall, and from the sounds of it that's the style of the dress- to be short- so I wear it as a shirt and love it )Happy and looks nice, very soft.The material is good, not the stume" material, it is a little giving but not what I'd nsider stretchy" or elastic type material.Dress is well made with soft tton and very mfortable to wear.The dress is adjustable at the neck.Great valueBut really love it otherwise.They fit their purpose and the price is great for the quality.Yes, the stitching on the fingers holes is sketchy at best and one of mine has a hole in the wing by it, but not enough to bother me.No steel boning at all but that's not what wanted.Very mfortable and makes you sweatColorful, cheap and mfy.The material is very soft and mfy definitely for a fall day.Quality isn't fantastic, but for what is it its nice ).Not stylish but functional.Love the style and the material fit a bit mfortable except for the arms and certain part of the bag area are a bit tight too close for mfort.Very good and mfortableThere was a review that the lor rubs off.Good size and material for headscarves.Its lightweight And the straps are long so its easy to tie.I just wish the brim was a little more sturdy but overall its a great hat and easy to clean if need be.For the price this is a great quality dress.Its definitely not see through and it looks wonderful however, I ordered the large and was under the impression it was equivalent to a / and I can't get it fully zipped.I like the lor and the soft drape as well as the fact that they're great for travel and never wrinkle.Beautiful looks like it is a painting delicate and very prettyBye, frames are shinyOtherwise the quality of the hat is good, and very happy with the purchase.They are lightweight which is great for working in high temp OR's.The dress came as it looks and I think the material is fine.Overall it's really cute and am satisfied with my order.I love the shirt it's gorgeous and its school appropriate.They are good material with really great, vibrant designs.So far the at had kept me toasty when is snowed, during an ice rain, and during a good gusty blow.Grand daughter likes it and that is what is important.I gave this to our flower girl, along with an expensive gift that she would have forever, and she LOVED itVery mfortable flip flops.Other than a piece of thread ming undone, the waist trainer was perfectLooks cute but wish it had at least one clasp in frontWell made sweater.I haven't tried them on because I'm weeks pregnant and ordered them for post partum in hopes to smooth out my squishy tummy after.Seems like good quality material and shipping was very fastExtremely well for the price I paid for.I must say they look good.There is nothing wrong with the dress or quality.It mes with a awesome sturdy chain the lors and picture are really vibrant.It doesn't feel cheap at all and looks really good too.Great jersey and good price.Surprisingly it was ok overall..

beautiful and just what I wanted.Very stretchy and zy for him.I is, however, a darling siline jelly in purse.The product itself was beautiful as in the picture, but the gift packaging uld be much better than a cheap cardboard box.Really cute, great quality, beyond my expectations.Great design.....very masculine.I only wish they made this a bit thicker but other than that its a pretty ol sweater.these are very soft and cushy, but so far, they have held up my arches pretty well.And my arches are very highThe extra softness lets me actually walk.(Bone technically healed, but the lingering pain will be going on for a while....)Aside from that, the shoes seem durable and soft on the inside.The sliver beads do tend to me off easy but easy to fix.Shirt has a nice Atari logo, making it a nice addition to my video game apparel.For it to hold up, I'd remmend washing it on ld delicate cycle and dry on delicate.I love that I can match my outfit for yoga.I can feel the slip resistant beads" Nice wallet, fun designs.I love this outfit and so does my daughter.The outfit is cute and will work for her.Good quality shirt, but there is a huge x" patch on the pack stating the numbers .She loved the feel and the look.I love these bras, but they don't have an incredibly long life--the fabric pills rather soon.nice quality no problems.Good quality and nstruction unfortunately it was a little tight.This a beautiful dress it's long to the floor vers my feetReasonably good quality strap.Stitching is sturdy and the material is of good quality.Very light and mfortable, with a lining to add a bit warmth..Not a big deterrent for an otherwise pleasing jacket.Nice heavy set.Overall, the lor and quality worked for me.Aside from the size, they are definitely hot and my wife says they are very mfortable.I'm giving it stars because I haven't had it long enough to test it's durability.There was no strong odor, as some plastic/oil based products can have) upon arrival.The third one is a backup or maybe useful on a trip when I can't avoid change gathering.Nice sweater, but it tends to attract little pillies to it.Beautiful Knit Top that just looks special when worngreat sun protection for babynot as easy to tie on off while juggling babyBought this for my dad and he really likes how breathable they are.Love these earringsThe belt was thinner than I expected but it looks fine.I was pleasantly surprised to receive a quality belt for the price I paid.Was cute will work for what I want it for.Sturdy wide brim, adjustable, lightweight.They have good mpression.These socks have enough thickness for mfort.Other than that they will look perfect with everything else I orderedGlasses are just what I wanted.Inexpensive, lightweight and slim: perfect or boating on the water or a night on the town.i love it when i go out because even if it's noisy, you can still hear the little bell sounds.All in all its a good dress at a good price but I might have to invest in some alterations to get that perfect fit.I bought a few things from this supplier and I realized that their jewelry is of a good quality.My gosh, that mesh pocket is absolutely amazing.nice quality watch.Looks great with a long necklace and gladiator sandalsPerfect summer dress that can be segwayed into fall with leggings, boots, and a scarfNonetheless, they're a good purchase if looking for midi rings.For the price, it's a great deal.It took a long time to arrive and had a small hole in the seam after wear, but it was able to be sewn easily and I still wear it regularly.I love the lor block and the material is mfortable, not too thin.price was greatIf you or your child has a sensitivity to strong scents, I'd advise opening it in a well ventilated area or outside.nice and light and looks ol alsoIt isn't as loose as it seems to be in the photo, but the material is super soft and the shirt is one of my new favorite.The only reason that it doesn't get stars from me is because it's a little thin, and if the hair isn't positioned just* right, it will show the webbing underneath.Quality product, but too large need to return.This will be a perfect dress for the summer as it is light and stretchy.It's plain so it provides many enhancement options.Very soft wears wellIt is made in China, but material and quality appear to be good.It fits nicely over a tee shirt, but I can't wear it with a liner, or even with a sweat shirt.They look fantastic and the return process seems to be simple.seems to be well made and warm, but winter will tell me more about that.It's such a cute dress though and the pattern is greatSimple no metal buttons, zippers or netting.They are easy on with the velcro.Good quality and vibrant lors.Love the fabric, very sturdy/well made.Fabric is stretchy and clingy, but let's go at the waist line nicely.They look sporty and are very reasonably priced, I believe I paid for them.Liked the fabricThese are lovely.Very cute suit, good quality

all.A great product.Sexy, and mfortable.Very soft though.Good price quality.It's really much warmer than I expected, but I guess that depends on the person.For me, it's probably better for fall.The Packaging was great, The earrings are exactly as shown,just received them today// so far so goodIt is beautiful but I did have to cut a few threads.Dress gems were blue and very loose but dress is absolutely beautiful.We had to tack the dress together in the front because of prom rules about midriffs showing so if you need to do that as well it can be done easily without looking altered.the product is ideal for me.Looks nice very thin material.It's a pretty nice bag for this price.I carry this everywhere from work to weekend use.Overall it's a great bag for daily use.Plenty of room for necessities.Looks exactly as picturedThe hat is exactly as I saw and purchased.For the price can't beat itCute bag but not great quality.It's a very pretty teal and my daughter loved it, but I just wanted to make sure everyone knows that if you are needing a navy jacket.....this is not it.But its very nicely made.Great organization.This is a nice shirt made of quality.The only reason I did not give it starts is because the hem where the lace is doesn't lay properly.It's a nice sweater and looks great on my daughter which is why I gave it stars.This is a great skirt.Nice texture, no pilling, I do wish it had a more defined waist with more elastic.Love these- but you they are sheer in the rearpretty well described in he picture.This is very cute and well made.A casual shoe that lights up the day.top is great, bottom is eh"It was more sheer than I was expecting but very soft.The materials are soft and smooth.I love the feeling that nothing bonded me around ) However, you better hand wash it.I hope the lor will settle after several washes.It meets my needs as far as it protecting my eyes and the fact that they are Polarized makes it even betterOverall, it's stylish and does the jobCool necklace.It spins in the necklace.It isn't the highest quality but nsidering that most novelty items like this are mplete junk, this item was surprising and relatively good quality.Love the jacket it's details are a very nice addition to the entire outfit.Love them, mfy, a little roomy but better than tightA solid leather belt.Very cute one piece.Also mfortable.Overall the pants quality is good.We put them in wash almost every other day and the lor is still good.Cute didn't care for wire the pendant is on would rather have a chain style.Earrings are cute.She still loves them because she needed some socks and they are cute.Looks exactly like the pictureThis is a very stylish, classy retro backpack.A bit daring in terms of cleavage exposure, but heck, its for a vacation in Cancun:) It's not magic, but it's cute and I feel cute wearing it.I'm sure the instructions are to keep the shape and quality.This is an excellent price for this top.Pretty and very lightThis dress is absolutely beautifulMy daughter loved the mfort of the bands and big flower.They are really soft and mfy and the pockets are the best added bonusWonderful product.Not as supportive as a regular sports bra.I usually wear them on lifting days not cardio days.Love the green stone, just not sure about the rhinestone embedded piece in front.Not an original but still good.Its really soft.Nice quality and a good mpact size for phone and wallet essentials.great jacket, very warm.SoftNice QualityWas never ld enough to wear so I can not mment on wearability.Great price and very nice necklaceIt does seem like a lot of work to get the vest to the point of being flattering and usable, but for this price, maybe I should have expected that.They look great without being too flashy, which is good because a tie clip is supposed to be an accent piece.Beautiful dress bought it for my daughter to wear to a daddy daughter dance she loves it.It is just a little too loose in the chest area so my mother n law is going to fix that.Very nice especially for the price.Product was not mpletely assembled when I recieved but for price good deal and problem was easily fixed.This is perfect for a long dress which is what I wanted, but I will still need to hem it which is a good thing in my opinion).It's a well made bag.It is great in every aspect except sometimes the the buckle catches on something and the belt loosens (I'm not sure my daughter would ever be able to use this Update: So I was wrong, my daughter is now months and they finally fit and are great to wear around the houseI have to loosen up my laces to get them to fit more mfortably, and this is after removing the old insoles as stated in the directions.These are some of the better insoles I have found.The bibs were really cute and soft.It's mfy and glad I went with a Medium.Bag it's great for the price but after reading other reviews I thought it would be bigger.It's really pretty, loose flowy.I like that it's flattering for a post partum body and also a stylish nursing top that doesn't seem like one.I absolutely love that the back is a little longer to ver the bum.It works out great to wear with pants or leggings.Overall I'm happy to find affordable, cute nursing tops and am glad to have this and another of a different lor in my wardrobe.Good product and serviceThis is a very pretty bracelet and can be worn for both day and evening.There are gold seed beads interspersed among the turquoise beds.There are sections of the bracelet that have wire threaded through to keep the ils tight together.Otherwise, it's a quality shirt and the logo is a good transfer.Very unique and stylish...Nice PJs.They're perfect for what they need to do.Gold loring scratches off easy, will need to replace with a higher quality product for daily wear.This bag is great, perfect for work.Very neat and professional looking.Still feels awesome and looks great at the main pipe areaFabric is so soft and feels GREATLooks good on, I would suggest this product to a friend.Looks great and keeps the ears warmGood quality but the fit is for a -- month old.Nice can't wait to wear them.This one is mfortable and fun.thick enough, warm and feels durable.The yoke is surprisingly lined with a satiny material and I worried that it would be too warm.very sexy underwearA lot of reviews said it did so I was skeptical but all I did was re arrange the straps and now it's perfect.Beautiful watch thoughIt's a great shirt, I bought it for my fianc and she loves it.good craftsmanship.Looked amazing with my retro party dress, but did arrive with a jewel that needed to be glued back on.Other than that, they work great with leggings or just putzing around the house.Has a great variety and some duplicates.One of my balls did crack though but for this price and the amount that you have in here you honestly can't beat this deal.Many will not peel off the sheets.Otherwise awesome.Nice tees, stretch a bit by the end of the day.But a cute summer shirt for sure The stamp, fabric, length and width are good.This is a in purse not shoesLook fancyI wish the flared part were a little flatter instead of so much of a dome, if that makes sense.Otherwise, I love them.It`s a fine wallet.All in all, it is a well made and high quality wallet.Had pierced nose in past, wanted this nose pin, it's perfect as well as mfortable, you don't even feel it in your nose.I currently work in a untry that requires modesty, but is extremely hot.I think it would look better if my B cup were a C or D, to balance the amount of material.All in all, this is a great shirt for work.If you need or want support this is not your suit.But for relaxation and hiding tummy issues it's a winner.In any case its a great shirt for the quality and price.I think it can be easily fixed with plyersI REALLY love the neckline its flattering but not too revealing which is something I struggle to find, especially in this price range.Dress is not exceptional quality but is GREAT for the priceHe will have room to grow into it.I've had this for awhile, still in near perfect ndition.Would be stars if the strap keeper wasn't so close to the buckle.How awesome our wooden sunglasses.I picked up these because they're made of bamboo which I thought was even more awesome very stylish and yet very different at the same time.Very cute dress/top.And they are not see through, so even betterGood QualityI own several Vera Bradley bags.They look beautiful and delicate.It was made in China and their larger tops are made for the larger Chinese women, not American women.Great product feel and fit are excellentPerfect under shorter skirts for a little extra verage.Easy fix with a belt.Thin material, good for layering or alone.Arrived on time, very pretty and sturdy.It's small and stylish and I love the smell of genuine leatherThe beads on the mala are beautiful, a deep amethyst purple.They are semi- translucent and reflect light beautifully.The mala is well made, seems very durable.It looks much classier this way.Otherwise, it is a beautiful mala for the price.Super cute and stretch material.The shirt itself is very nice--great quality.Cute and mfortableGreat laces thus far they've been through a uple months of wildland firefighting.Really pretty bra especially for the price.It's a nice dress for the price.Great fabric and design.Nice sweater, material not as soft, a little stiff, but will go well with jeans, or casual wear.Love this and the Bohemian lookThis dress is great.Material is a little thin but overall good for the price.This is the send hat I bought so that we will be able to just keep one in the diaper bag for unplanned outdoor outings.The lor of the stone is the same as in the picture and it came with a matching set of earrings.It's lovely.Wish it were a little smaller, if you me right out of the shower it does not absorb water well, but overall feels like being wrapped in a fluffy blanket.But they work for now and the price is great.Again, fine for the price, but I'm glad I didn't spend any more on this product.Edit //: These held up pretty well for a uple of months before a lens popped out and got lost while I was mowing the lawn.The frame is actually still in good shape, which I can't say for my many other pairs of readers, including flexies and Magnavisions, that lasted no longer than these.If I ever find the lens again not likely given my yard is acres) I'd be able to pop the lens back in and they'd probably last a few more months.looks expensive, holding up well after wearing everyday for a weekFirst kilt I've owned and I loved it.Now for me the lors fading isn't a deal breaker just a little disaponting.The pants still look good and are mfortable.The material is stretchy

attention.So far it hasn't tarnished and I have been wearing it for two months...even in the shower.Fabric was quality and lor was vibrant.Like my new pants a lot but wish the waist was elastic.I'm planning to wear these to work just hope they are mfortable enough.Pants look fabulous thoughOver all it's really cute, and roomy on the inside.Thought it would be a little more A line, but i can work with it.Not as quite as I expected in material...These are nice for the priceThe box that they me in is NOT wood, however, but it will make a nice holder.Magnet uld be stronger but overall is exactly what I wantedWay too wide for my husband to wear though, and shinier than he likes in a ring.Lace sleeves held up in washer dryer just fine.The dark gray has a slight greenish tint to it and the logo feels a little like an old iron-on but appears to be much better quality).This is such a pretty necklace.The hat held up great even after dropping it in the ocean.It can be a little disncerting until you learn how to angle your head for optimum viewing.excellent buyGood quality but does not fit well.You just need to be careful what you wear under it.I had been wearing them for quite a while About months) and the silver still have not darken like some of the other items that I have bought in the past.The blue crystal looks good and bright, not super dark like some others.These are a good set of jewelry and overall just have to take good care of it and they will last quite a while.The prices of this item is superb although the shipping takes a while, however it was on time and in good packaging.Art work was acceptable.Not top of the line but had good detail for the price.The material is soft and mfy and perfect for teaching Zumba.It is a good length though and nice design.It's a beautiful dress Will start to fall apart after a few months/several washings, but for one season, it was cute and super warm.Warm and light weight.This watch is very classy looking I get mpliments,

biggerI ordered this on a whim looking for a simple black cardigan with pockets surprisingly not easy to find, at least for my picky self) it ended up fitting me perfectly.The quality can be mpared to some similar ones I also bought from Victoria secrets.Wear these in low-light when I play golf, and they are perfect.The heavier frame blocks wind, which is good for me because I have dry eyes.It's lightweight fabric and very mfortable.Great for oler swims.I am ' D, and a solid .It thought I would get to wear it out on the weekends, put in it is more of a lounge fit for me.It is cute and casual though and a nice value for the price.He said it was mfortable and warm.Nice fabric, really cute casual dressThe design is perfect for me.Function over form.I have not had this product for very long so I am not able to speak to the durability of it in terms of longevity.It seems well nstructed as far as I can tell.However, if I have any problems with that in the future, I will be sure to post an update to this review with any relevant photographs.This is a good product and I would remmend it.This dress is lovelyAmazing quality tooThese have flash mirror lenses just like the real Dior technologics but they're not exactly like them.The Dior ones reflect about everything but these only reflect certain angles of light but it's real close to the Dior ones.These are very pretty and shinyA little larger than I thought so I haven't worn them yet, The lever-back seems well made and the metal looks like the finish will hold up well too.Looks even better on.Simple and mfortableGood fit, good nstruction, good look.It is a beautiful topVery soft warm.Cute summer purse.Excellent quality though.I wanted something mfy whilst trying to lose the baby weight bit XL would have been fine.Soft, Slinky...not see through..I really like these socks, they are warm and what i like more about it is that they are tton.Good quality, very happy with the product.The shine can rub off easilyGood quality but I had to return the first because a large which usually fits well) was too tight for my tastes... Just a basic white tee, nothing special about the actual shirt.Quality printing.It feels more like fleece.Do not buy if you are expecting this to smooth your stomach out.Great and fair priceLooks very chicI am ncerned about the quality.But it feels as if this is one of those necklaces that's not meant to last forever.Accurate photo.Fits nicely but noticing the band might wear out quickly...Comfortable and keeps stuff" separate and dryCute and very mfortable.These were very cute and mfortable to wear.A reminder: they do me as a single piece, as stated in the product description.This is lovely fabric, washes well, and the pockets are big enough to be functional.Otherwise I love this shirtLove the marble accent on these sunglasses.Well made...I love them because the screw on ball is also a stone, not just a plain old metal ball like % of the belly rings out there.This is an awesome set, ESPECIALLY for the price.Cute, Girly, Shiny, Perfect.So much mfortable.It wasn't as form fitting as I had expected, but over all I really like this shirt.Lovely piece providing style and max mfort EXCEPT the sleeves are a different fabric and I would have preferred all French terry.Looks especially nice tied at waist.Look and feel like good qualityPurchased this for my daughter who just loves infinity scarves.This is a nice, lightweight material that she can wear even in the warmer weather.Overall, I think this was a great purchase.Seamstress put straps on dress and that worked out fine.These fit my wider face, but the quality/finish isn't what I'd hoped.The quality is good although a bit thin but still I love it.This shirt is super mfortableI really like this pj; so hard to find percent ttonIt is definitely clingy, but seems to be the perfect length.The handle on the purse is slightly thin and feels very fragile but otherwise a great item.The material is cheap but looks and feel pretty solid although the glass brilliant is not pretty well glued to the earring base.Other than that is a nice piece of fashion jewerlyI love this dress, is perfect for meThey are thick, so they would be appropriate for a man or woman who was interested in chain jewelry.They are well built and should last a long time.They are heavy, so if you are looking for delicate pieces this is not for you.Amazing price and nice and soft.Nice, but expensiveFront has a little to much room but still makes the wife happylooks and functions elegant and high quality.only mplaint is a bit too narrow for men's belt, lacking masculine.Really cute, bulges in back when tied but other than that I love itIt's nice and warm, but the picture is not what you get.This thing is warm and value for money.The interior is very soft and cushiony.That also helps to keep the wearer warm.nice fabric; not full of lintlittle more taupe and yellow than my son expected but the shirt is of good quality.A classic look.Haven't used them too much yet as I'm still working on my stume, but they seem like they will work well.Beautiful, expensive... does not have slots nor a pen holder...beautiful but no so useful.This is a super soft sweater with a great fit for my teen daughter.Made kind of boxy, but I get mpliments when I wear it.REALLY mfyBut other wise they r very mfyFrench cuffs are well sewn.Cotton quality is fine with no burrs and thin as a tux shirt should be.I really enjoyed the fact that it was a one piece outfit and the tie clipped on and off.Very warm and mfortable.Material is very thin, great for the summer.Color holds well during washings.Shoes light up beautifully my daughter loved them.Received the product on time, and it was packaged well.I bought a medium and at " height it drapes about " off of the floor.I simply washed it, ran a lighter over the seam a few times, and now it's good to go.How ever this did work stacking pieces, and this is a large roll so you'll have plenty for many hats to me.Warm and nice.Shirt is made from an okay material, it is very loose and perfect to wear with a cardigan.I paired it with lace up riding boots and cream lored sweater to wear to a rustic untry wedding.It was perfectIts very light, it works, it just feels like it uld be dollars less.I had such bad hip pain with this pregnancy and this product definitely helped my pain from the nstant up and down from my desk.I uld still use it, but it would have been better to have the extra support.It's lightweight material and she says its super mfy.The little belt in the front makes it stylish.The quality is greatNice fit, mfortable though the siline pad doesn't exactly sit on my scar unless I pull the c-panty down a bit.A pretty piece of felt makes it look nicer, and the design on the lid is very pretty.This is an attractive bracelet and very mfortable to wear.perfectLove these underwear.- star because they're kinda expensive.They're zy and the right weight not too hot.Beautiful hat, arrived packed securely in a box, just tried it on my six year old today and it is too small but we will return and request the larger size because the hat is quality craftsmanshipvery happy with this productThe fabric feels inexpensive but the overall look is lovely.Needs a good pressing or steaming out of the package.Beautiful fabric with slight sheen and mfortable stretch.The stitching is a bit rough for the st, making me question how well it will fare with its first wash, but overall I am pleased with this purchase.The quality is good, for the price.Tucked into a pencil or A-line skirt, this is perfect for my taste.its warm and durable.I love that I can pop it in the washer anytime and not worry about it falling to pieces.Nice and zy.It looks much better on than in the packaging.Will need to leave it out in the sun for a long period of time to help with the glow effect.Great fit and mfortable keeps the boys looking awesomeJust needed to be loosened up.Says they are mfortable.Very mfy for me.They feel great, but not having a fly is an annoyanceIt was nice and had potential, but to go out in public in a swimsuit I need it to be perfect.I returned it, though it might work beautifully on a different body shape.The material for the leggings is thick and wonderfulThinner than I thought but works wellThe slippers are cute, bright lors, and very well made in Austria.Soles are firm and durable enough to wear outside.I have high arches and they provide good arch support.I currently own another model of Giesswein slippers and those are made from boiled wool inside and out.Gentle wash ldFabric is nice, lets hope it holds together for HalloweenNot as nice quality as I hoped but it will work for my event.Inexpensive enough I don't worry about losing them, but I haven't lost them yet.Super stretchy.Now the necklaceits awesome, the necklace makes it all worth it.Material seems soft.Other than that, it's perfect.They look sturdy and I get mpliments on them every time I wear them.it was delivered within days prime and good qualityBut I needed a nice satin inner under business suits.My daughter loved this and wore it most days throughout the winter.Great socks well made and fit great.I like them, in that they TRULY are NO SHOW socks.Fabric not super substantial but very cute and soft.Love it with a statement necklace.These ears are fluffy and cute but let me tell you guys.Had to wash times and let it air dry outside before I was mfortable wearing it but for the price it's excellentIt is very nice but not my favorite because of the high neck but that is my faultMay be a case made with aluminum is more light and suitable for lady.Comfortable shoes stars just because of the material.Good quality, but run a bit largeNot leather inside but it's well madeDelicate and nicely made, but it's rigid, and I was expecting a flexible clip.Great stume for the price.look nice for cake derationOverall though, the quality is great, and i loved that the top or bottom uld be tighter or looser depending on your needs.Nice build quality, didn't shrink in the wash.Good quality and nice options on length of chain.They look like they will hold up decently, but I uld see the stud bending easily if not cared for.Nice and mfortable for little oneI love it the cuality is very good the only thing the it's to longOriginal delivery was a belt that did not work for me.However, it looks great and the customer service was superb.otherwise made well.The price was also a drawing factor.Great shoes and I love the design.It's true they are still fairly visible in your ears, but mpared to an actual piece of jewelry, they are very subtle.I was happy to receive pcs not sure if that was intentional) because I have exactly piercings, so I was glad to have a spare in case I lost parts, so overall I am happy with this purchase.As another reviewer wrote, they are noticeable because they're a more white-clear than a perfect clear.But for the price and how secure they are in your ears and the fact that any retainers will still take up space and be somewhat visible I'd say it's still a good product.Comfy and flatteringBeautiful piece of jewelry and very well made.Easy to put on and no mplaints about ld feet.We didn't have enough time to get it altered, plus with the beading I figured alterations would have been a little pricey.The three settings are ol, I switch it up a lot depending on what's happening in the music at the time.The ntroller uld be a little more robust, it's kinda warping I think just under the stress from the battery springs, but for the st I wasn't expecting a rock solid product anyway.Its super mfortable rib fabric will get you hooked and spoiled, which it's good since you can mix and match with any piece in your wardrobe and keep wearing it all day long.Nice top for priceGood fit and good quality.The quality, the fabric thickness and fit is are all above mu expectationsThis is a great product for helping your belly feel tight and secure after a c section.They are mfortable, aren't too tight; wash well/don't shrink.Quality was just okay.Shoe is solid.The earings themselves are lovely, shiny.If it was packed properly, the earings would have been even more stunning.Quality of shirt is not great.The ring is very smooth and polished with a nice shine.The stainless steel is slightly darker than sterling silver.It's mfortable to wear and doesn't sit too high off the finger.Overall it appears to be fairly good quality, sturdy and attractive.I've added a few pictures so you can see for yourself.So ol lookingTook away one star because the tips of the ear parts are a bit sharp and I have to get used to hanging them on my shirt carefully.Overall a very nice tie and good craftsmanship.I liked the fit for the waist and hips, but am not quite sure about the elastic inside.I thought the fabric was great.Great glasses for the price, fits very wellPerfect tton tee for sleeping in.Keeps you ol when it's hot and is soft on skinVery cute and detailedThis piece is beautifulBeautiful shirt for such a great priceI love it its so sparkly.Really nice quality sweater.The pedals and cleats are good quality and the shoes aren't falling apart after several hundred kilometers.But after washing with fabric softner they are perfectOtherwise happy with the shirt.The material is stretchy and thick.Great set of scrubs.Soft and mfortable, this piece vers well.It is roomy and seems to be decent quality.I'll update on the quality if needed.Very pretty, and it does the job but it's too priceyThey did stretch my piercing just a tad bit but it was perfect because they keep wanting to close up anyways The bottoms are nice the tops not sure how they will last.Nice workmanship and size.Print fabric not great quality and stretches out white.I love the lors and the material is so mfortable.The bust is always the hardest for me to fit properly- No fault of yours, I love the material and lor- The price was almost perfectMaterial feels nice on skin.So overall happy with them, mfort is good, can't speak to durability, but they seem like they are well made.The top vers my boobs perfect, but it does slide so I wore them with pasties to avoid any nudity.This bikini is beautiful, but it isn't a bikini to swim, and do activities in.Both pieces have a thin white fabric which helps from seeing any of the private areas.I wore this bikini for about hours, and washed it in delicate, and hung to dry, and it still looks like new.The straps ntinuously fell off of my shoulders, so it would have been nice if I uld tighten them some more.Very light and good for everyday and travel I like it quality very goodThey won't last forever, but they are mfy, and will last long enough to justify the st.I received sparkly tongue rings.It's made well enough with felt fabric and triangles felt secure.I love it and my son is very happy and mfortable in it.Good fabric, decent fit, with a little stretch to it.Otherwise great shirt, would be from Too Fast again although I wish the prices were a bit lower...Nice feel, very lightweight and silky.They run big in my opinion so they filled up quickly with sand in the ocean.It also washed well and still felt soft.Very cute and high quality.Its super cute and makes my chest look ok but I wish there was more padding, but that is what I have been saying since puberty so, no biggie.Good quality, old-style tweed vest.They are a great size but the first time I washed them, the MILK IT black circle part faded a lot so the top black part looks a year older than the bottoms.The ntrast on the etching is a little light for my tastes and seems different than the picture used here but it fits perfectly and meets my needsLooks cute but I think they should improve the quality of the elastic and the charms.For the price it is a great buyVery nice Halloween stume, and received lots of mpliments, the material is stretchy so I would think it can fit different sizesVery warm and oh so softThis wallet is great, I think my only issue is the in purse having this partial separation?The cloth between the sides doesn't me down all the way so if you keep your ins organized for some reason, I don't remmend this wallet.The fabric is a nice off white but it is a bit sheer so you would need to wear a cami or something under it.Good quality really cute and mfortable but definitely order a size or two up especially if you have a long torso.Comfortable to wear around the house but too short to wear outside but if you are young and on the small side it's a very cute dress.All the seams appear to be well sewn.The top fits just as I hoped and the elastic in the bra is mfortable.The outer shell feels like a nice leather I uldn't find a material listing on the purse).The inside is lined with a satin feeling flowered design material that really doesn't go with the southwestern outer shell.The purse itself feels heavier than what I'm use to but really isn't an issue as I wanted the purse because of the back zippered pocket.Beautiful gownI added a blingy belt to give this beautiful gown some wow.I also had layers of the tulle trimmed out.Arrived quick is good quality.Looks great on my daughter loves itThis is really a great wig for the money.I used it for a teen production, and it made it through performances and is still in great shape.Looked greatMermaids fall asleep with their heads on pillows."The stitching is nice and I expect this outfit to be fairly durable as a stume/pool play.GOOD MATERIAL-CHILD LOVED IT.I would have preferred a mat finish.Couldn't ask for better quality for the price.Very ol and stylish goggles.Purchased as a part of my burning man wardrobe and they were very popular amongst my friends and random acquaintances.Knocked off one star due to them being slightly unmfortable due to a lack of padding around the frame as well as there being a sharp piece of plastic that I had to file off from their injection mold.very mfortable, and serves it's purpose.This necklace looks very pretty with denim and my sundresses.But a quality product for the money.Happy with product.Cute but the hearts move...This is no fancy piece, it's a no frills, cheap watch with a nice look to it.It's quartz so it'll keep time fairly accurately.Pretty great sweatshirt otherwise.Great tank, soft and stretchy.I would love to buy this without the iron onThis fits nice and loose and easy care and wear.Still very light and mfy.Very soft and mfortable, a little large on my hands.beautiful bikini.Perfect giftThe charms are beautiful.I love this necklace and earring set.Nice prints and workmanship.They look and feel greatI would have given stars, but the package they came with had shampoo I ordered in it that got all over the boxGood quality productFor this to be a synthetic product I likeGREAT PRODUCT AT A GOOD PRICEThis top has a beautiful design.The purpose of a tunic is to feel relaxed and mfy.Also, I prefer a tton blend for the warmer weather but this is polyester.Great for everyday use.SUPER mfortableGreat socks; however, I do like the thinner Incredisocks I purchased last time a bit better.But the lights look and work great.Decent quality for the price and its lot of fun to wear when we play Pokemon Go at the park.I bought this for my girlfriend, she enjoys the material.Its very silky and does not add the sweaty feeling.It looks great on her and does not leave her exposed It suits the curvy).The shoulder straps are really mfyThe chain is sturdy which I like since I work with kids a lot.And the price is good also.The chain was giving me problems but I love it so far )I'm happy with the bag, the price is right.From what I briefly saw of it, the set isn't the highest quality, but then again I did not pay the price for high quality so it's not a big surprise.Decent quality for the price and great lour) so I'm going to buy a different lour in a and see how those are.Comfortable and easy to work in them.Comfortable and great deal for the priceThe robe is very mfortable.The robe looks heavier on the mputer than it is.It is a lightweight velour-type robe.The prices were very good.Super mfortable and cute, the only problem is that it does not close mpletely and I would have liked it to.It's perfectCheap way for a nice little gift.The length almost looks fine, but since the top layer is tulle, you can see thru, with the layer underneath being super short.Nice belt love the design.Just wish the notches were closer to the tip.Perfect for what I was needing.It is good product for the price.Love the look, nice material, but I find it is hard to keep on with it's lovely flowing" but open structure.Good and resistent materials.Good designThis is a decent set of single flare tunnels.The finish is not perfect but three sets of tunnels for this price is a pretty good deal.This is a very pretty and mfortable top.But is beautifulno cushioning in them what so ever.I love them but please be advised my feet were aching after hours....Pain is beauty though right?other than not having any cushioning there super well made and I was more than happy with themI like the quality of their product and they deliver so fast.Great material, quality nstruction and a fun purchase.We purchased this for my daughter to wear for several events leading up to graduation.It is good quality for the price but certainly not the highest quality fabric.It is definitely a good buy though as it does do the trick for banquets and such where it won't be worn more than a handful of times.Nice quality .. As expected ..I'd give this stars if the lace wasn't a totally diff lor than the rest of the dress... dress is great.Because I like my yoga tanks loose.Very good fit and material.SturdyIt feels like a nice, quality belt and fits fine now that I have a new hole.Very warm Fits great love the material, not sure about the white lacegreat suit, fit fine for water aerobics but faded fast in the chlorine.Material light and ol.The top fits well and hides my mom flab.Beautiful outfitIt's nearly impossible to find % tton sweatshirts these days, so I am very happy to have found this one.The quality seems pretty good and the lor was the same as it looked in the picture.Great yoga pants at a great price.(It is see-through, I don't believe this will do good in water) I received this pretty quickly to my surprise.This material is very stretchy, and the print still shows fine Overall I'm satisfied with this purchase, I would definitely buy different prints againI'm short so they are more ankle length than Capriit is very cute and mparable to brandy's it is not as soft as i thought it would be though but for the price, cant beat itShirt is so soft, feels great.I have washed them several times already and they maintain their fit and lorCute graphics.Good for ol, early fall weather.BEAUTIFULCute, ended up returning due to the shape not looking good with my face shape but my friend loved themThis dress was absolutely beautiful on meIt was slightly unmfortable, but not enough to deter me from wearing it for a night out.I love the shape and feel.Very fancy.Good quality scarf.I was extremely satisfied with the quality based on the price.Interesting fobs.Good value and quick deliveryI looked good in this.They Look greatWell nstructed.I love this shirt- it's mfy but best of all, my husband said it looks really good on me and he hasn't said that about any of my clothesThis jacket is cute and mfy.It is the perfect weight for end-of-summer and beginning of Fall and I also like that the sleeves can be rolled up and held with the tab/button details.Very lightweight and ol to wear.Washes well and dries quickly.I added a cinch in the center to give the front a bit more flair.Versatile and mfortable.Suitable price.I think both are good quality for kids play purses.Good product and arrived earlier than expectedOne ball was slightly cracked but still useableGood product good price.But still very mfy and looks goodThis dress is beautiful and extremely vibrant.The zipper is sturdy and fabric is very mfortable.Overall great pear of shoes the only thing it's lacking is the quality:).Really mfy and stretchyI have two piercings in each ear, so I can play around with size mbinations, which is great.Comfortable elastic headband.Seems to be of good quality, the price is fair.The box the belt came in is very extravagant.Perhaps some people like the quality of the packaging, but I would prefer less st through less expensive packaging.The bra/panties are not my thing but look fine with no flaws.However, it looked great for the beach wedding.This product overall is good, and mfortable, and perfect for people with small wristI love the material, the design.Over all its a great quality shirt.The skirt I got is super cute and I love to wear it.VERY, VERY CUTE NECKLACEApparently my arches are not symmetrical so I only wear one in my right shoe but it solved my foot ache problem when I run.The material isn't perfect, especially at the edges of the neckline, but that's to be expected by a dress so cheap.well made and the finish is good quality.Overall nice fabric and better than I expected.great shirt to dress up or down.It was also padded under wire, so it uld not be easily adjusted.My boyfriend loves when I wear it, so provacative.I was hoping this would be more suitable for the oler months but it is very light weight.Will layer it for wearing this fall winter.A bit see-through, but still ol.i haven't had an issue as far as disloration and losing the fitness of the boxers, overall they are just a good pair of boxers.I only just received them but noticed there is a offensive odor to them right out of the package.Love it,its perfectI love how soft the pants are and how warm they keep my kiddos.Very good product am happy that I bought it.Have not had a chance to wear them all day so not sure how my feet will feel at the end of the day.Cute purse for kids.smaller than expected but very pretty..Form fitting.Not quite as big stones as I thought but still nice.Really like the light weight fabric.The material is great too.It isn't tton but it isn't mpletely fake" either- to me it's a great material for a shirt.The shirt is kind of expensive but it is worth .The glow isn't as bright as some and only charges well in full sunlight but the design makes up for it.Beautiful, high quality dress.I love these but would like for the material too not be so attracted to fuzzies and fur magnets.Perfect for a night out when you don't want to carry too many things.This definitely was not designed for every day use, unless you are a real minimalist.These are a beautiful sandals, just a little tight in the front and loose in the upper side, I am wearing them at home to brake them in and hopping to wear them out pretty soon.This too was perfect.This is a beautiful shirt for summer, great quality and has lace on the back that adds style to the shirt.Great quality, however it's awkward to get on my daughters foot cause she has fat feet and her heel will not go to bottom of the shoe.just a little too warm... i was not expecting that, but for now they are just fineOther than that its a beautiful watch that arrived soon than expected and overall I'm pleased with my purchase.good price good productEspecially if I am doing a lot of walking in my flats.Beautiful ver, the only thing i noticed is that it snags very easily.Attractive, lightweight straight skirt with stretchy material that allows for easy movement.Nice nightgown, great mfortable material.Straps on bra and waist thingy are adjustable.But for the price and my first impression when I pulled it out of the bag, staying intact for one use was surprising.My wife liked it when I gave it to her, but she hasn't worn it.These work well to keep out the Tucson sun only thing is that they are very stiff plastic, but that might be a plus to some.Pretty durable things, too, since I've managed to sit on them a few time with no breakage.Also very stylish if I might add.It is good quality leather, very well-made with gorgeous details.There are just a uple of things that uld functionally be better.Again, this is a gorgeous, well-made bag with just a few functional flaws.However, I am very underwhelmed with how the " rolls; it certainly does not roll smoothly particularly when I am rolling it alongside me.It performs better when I am pulling it behind me which is not what I expected from spinner capabilities.So mfortable.Very high quality product.This dress was perfect and just as described.This dress is made of a stretchy material that just works so well for all different body types.Beautiful eye catching bag it is fairly tight throughout, which is nice to wear as an underlayer, but puts a little more pressure on my chest than I would prefer and is also not so flattering to the post-partum body.The elastic works well on my bravado body silk bras.They don't reduce the glare mpletely, however.These hats are nicely made and fit well.The material is soft and they are exactly as pictured.I was pleasantly surprised with the quality for the price.Lightweight and durable, stunning and fancy-pantsThe band is a decent quality rubber sports style band.Stainless steel back and metal, painted housing under the plastic bezel.These rings are perfect.Overall, I love the setThe white portion was a little see through, but great as a ver upNothing fancy but practical.Love the lor, love the fabric.It is super mfortable.Beautiful and well made.I did have to cut down the length of the tassels as they got tangled and didn't look good, but otherwise I like it.Great birthday present and really classicgood quality, will add mfort to some of my shoes and boots that have zippers.The material is a little thinner, and maybe a little shorter than I was expecting however, I'm enjoying them with each wearing.Very useful for travel and quality product.Very pleased with these leggings.Very beautiful scarf.The paint it quality and it is a good size.I stick with Sperry Shoes because they are durable.Excellent ring for tree priceAlthough this product took forever in the mail, I really love this hip scarf.It is great to wear for my belly-dance classes.However, they are made very well, and were in perfect ndition.This look well made, but is a little bit small, and are not very shiny, maybe better to wear on Helix or Orbital not good for standard lobe, this is for earing onlyThe Belly Bandit fit's great but when you apply the Velcro it ends up sticking crooked especially when trying to make it tight.These look ol and are of good quality.Nice shirt.. my daughter loved itConstruction uld be better.Very soft, stretchy.Perfect for the summer.I just wish they had elastic fabric string rather than an elastic plastic band...but it's ol once you don't abuse it.I also wonder if it's real tigers eye...It's so perfectly shiny and glossy.It's cute and nice quality.I want it loose.It is light weight which is a plus in this summer heat)Material is very mplimentary to my body and love the spandex like feelingThe glasses are not a good fashion statement but at least you can see when you need to.Not as soft as I would like, but the material is sturdy and the shirt holds up well in the wash.Nothing against how it looked on her, I think she looked nice, but she felt very self nscious about wearing it.Just know it's that form-fitting, tight-but-strechy-enough material.. where you feel mfortable enough but it's going to show nooks and crannies if you have any.seem to be good quality but post part that goes through ear is larger than regular stud or maybe it's because its flat and not pointed either way good productThis is a beautiful purse.Fit nicely, material isn't the best as far as durability, but adequate for the price.The waist is high too so it vers my post baby stomach issues I hate.It's well made with good thick felt.Wore these to my Daughter's Wedding and they were mfortable and pretty at the same time..Very mfortable to useGood quality product...exactly as describedI am very pleased with this sweater.This turned out to be a pretty decent sweater after all.It's really mfortable and looks really cute with a pair of leggings and some boots.Love the Turquoise look, but butterflies with rose bodies are a bit girly for my taste.Still, I have worn it and gotten many mpliments.Look great and are what I expected.It's def a crop top thoughVery good product.It is also very mfortable.Its stylish and light and mfortable.I like it very much, it's vaporous, then it's perfect for my untry that is tropicalMade well for the priceThe smell of this bag made the room smell.The cat lor needs some smoothing.The material is a bit artificial but for the price I would say it's pretty well-made.It's a delightful item that's sure to be a whimsical addition to your wardrobe.And has got many nice mplements.Great sunnies at a great price.Packed beautifullyWhere it all the time with my other hippie jewelry.Fabric is actually like a silk soft and they are thin but they trap heat well.A very nice little ring, well made and mfortable to wear.Great sweater, popular everytime I wear it.Also, not the best material, but for one Halloween night it would be fine.Size is good with good quality material.I love the fabric .it flows so nicely.Very cute earrings.Note: It is a little difficult to find the right hole in the backing because of the many holes in the earring.Great product, stones and material are darker than shown in picture.I live in Colorado and these keep me warm on those ld mornings heading into work.Hopefully this eases with time and wear.Softer and less supportive than the Saxx Fiesta, but still really mfortable.Maybe a good postpartum dress but not work for me now.Will be very warm and zy.But looks great and feels really nice.Very cute and protects against sun but the navy is not as dark as the picture Very nice loring and material but it ran small.Pretty pattern, falls nicely.Hat is good quality though.Looks great, but beads hanging off frequently get in the way of things.My boy is months old and is lbs, it is soft and mfortable.I love the idea of earmuffs without the wire over my head, but I'm not sure they will stay on in windy weather.They fit good and are very mfortable, so I'm hoping they will work when the weather gets ld and windy.The quality is pretty good and we have been searching for pj's for my him that were reasonably priced.The cut and material are fantasticThis was a great tool while expanding pregnant) and not in full-fledged maternity pants.The replacement lenses fit pretty well.Very nice and elegant.However, it's still elegantNice quality, though.It somewhat hugs curves and imperfections that you wish it didn't but it is very mfortable and seems well made.They were perfectly fine but way too wide for my face, great service JoannaI would love to get a replacement screw because I love these glasses.I'm not sure if it's leather or actually pleather" otherwise I love itIts a very pretty stoneThese look great for fake stones very prettyGood quality and fit.Other than that I've worn them untless times and haven't had any problems with the fit or quality.If you're going for a skin tight look then it's fine but I was going for something looser.Item was as stated, percent tton, great for gym shorts and hanging around the house.It would have been great for pictures.good for fancy occasinsVery pretty, made a good gift.The design is pretty good as well.The perfect fit and classy look for a black tie affair.Accessories: Also beware of your accessoriesIn my opinion you do not need a necklace, it takes away from the beauty of the neckline.I found it to be fairly mfortable and just right, not too heavy.Really cute for the price.I love the length.I guess I should've known better based on the product image.But overall, I still like the product and got great use out of it over the summer.Haven't had a chance to wear it in the rain yet, so can't speak to the waterproofness yet, but I think it will be goodIt is a beautiful belt really nice gift box and a nice key chain gift inside.but i am finding the release leaver very hard to work Has the ray ban p etched on the lenses.Wanted a swimsuit that had bust support.The shoulder straps are mfortable.Its light weight and looks exactly like the picture.Its great for work and with leggings because it vers your back end.Good basic skirt, but I have others that are more flattering.They are on the cheaper side; price and material.If you're familiar with H&M/Forever , they are along those lines of quality.Pros: Comfy, Affordable, easy asses to nurse Cons: No washing info in English, shrink a good amount in dryer.Overall happy with the finished product.BeautifulPendent is excellent.Only drawback is there are is no separation or mpartments- if u put too much in I t, then ur fishing for things- But I totally love it anywayStill works great.Other than that perfect for airport weight standardsThere is honestly no way I would feel secure in playing around or swimming in this outfit as it offers very little support for my breast.Don't get me wrong, I will be wearing it, because I look fabulous in it.I really love the look of the outfit it looks like the picture, but the top just doesn't offer the support.Workmanship looks good have only used times so far.It's just perfect....Beautiful and unique piece of jewelry.My students think they are mfortable.Looks good with jean shorts or a denim skirt, perfect for a untry ncert.It's not the best quality dress but it's a great price for a flattering work dress.But I'm in the process of exchanging it now even though I have to pay a little more This dress arrived very quickly, it is a very sturdy material, and I love the lengthThis is a great dress to have in your closetI haven't been able to wear it as much as I would like to, only because I live in Texas and would be sweating a lot with this on.It looked great on stage, was mfortable and easy to put on and remove.Very simple.I thought I had lost my onyx earrings, so I ordered these.They do have a very nice sparkle to them.I wish the stem were just a hair longer, because it worries me that the backing uld fall off and I'd lose the earring.This looks Great onIt seems well made enough for the price; it's not a high end piece, but it's not a high end price, either.It's a really flattering little shirt, and a nice balance of sexy and vered up; this wouldn't work with a too-low neckline.The edges are raw and the button that holds the back together isn't exactly solidly attached nothing a few stitches can't fix but again, at this price point, that's to be expected.Very pretty ring, I bought it to wear in a cartilage piercing, and honestly it's not a good choice for that specifically.But it seems to be good quality, and for another application like a nose piercing or maybe eyebrow, it would work really well.I thought it would be tighter, but it is very mfortable and I like it.It's mfy, fits well and my purchase arrived sooner than expected.It was not easy to iron.It fits everywhere i just wish there was more support in the bust area.I can still wear it and it looks fine.Great quality product.I like it... it's light and soft.Both the pants and top appear to be well made.I received this product at a disunt in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.And not expensive.wow super cute, I got them in mail yesterday and wore them to work today and wow they are mfy.The fabric is slightly less soft/nice looking after a wash or two, but I still love the unique design so much.These work great for keeping my favorite pins in place.It is made of a durable material and the lor was true to the picture.The cups in the top are a firm thick padding and the bottoms are sewn together well.Simple nstruction, but mfortable for the growing bump.Very nice design.I loved the lors of the product and it feels like a good quality.Very pretty setFor the price you can't beat it.These are pricey in my opinion.However, the look and quality are very nice.She didn't poop while wearing it, so I can't mment on its ability to hold poop.It washes easily.Great shorts.Quality fabric and durable.The lace top part lies a bit weird and it's easily wrinkled but I still love the dress.The skirt is beautifulIt's very pretty and seems to be well made.Pretty nice for the priceAlthough soft this shirt is VERY SEE THROUGHOverall well made, a little bit short to fit my electric toothbrush, but still works.It has really has no stretch so that doesn't help me, but overall I really like itThe material is a very high quality, but deifnitely worth what you pay, and the shorts fit great what you pay.I love this bagHe st is reasonable and the product is nice.My grand daughter liked itLoved everything about it except the materialThis hat is wonderful and warm.Love the fit, lors and thick, stretchy material.But the soft and mfy foot padding is really nice.I know in another week they will be perfect.It's good material, it's even a little stretchy so order your normal size.Looks cute, just can't wear it quite yet.It,s nice that it has a draw string to adjust the size, very clever.The material of the dress is every elegant and beautiful Also the material has stretch which is always good for a plus size girl.The shirt is so cute, and it looks exactly like the photo.The material is soft and high quality, and you probably don't need to wear an undershirt.Its also a silky material.Comfortable shirtgreat item worked as stated and promt delieveryLove this wrapGreat for travel and layeringThis at is much better than I expected.Overall it handles rain and wind well.The ldest temperature I've worn it in was about degrees Fahrenheit with a strong wind and I remained perfectly warm.This skirt is a great deal for the price.Overall, this is a great skirt in an adorable pattern.Gifted and worn to keep her toes warm.Nicely plant crafted piece of jewelry but should have me with a chaingood solid nstruction.The material and the fabric are well nstructed for the price.this bag is magnificentFor as st effective as this was it is so cute.I would have loved it to be longer.I have bought several earrings from this mpany and have gotten many mpliments on this particular design.Daughter loved the lors, and material is shimmery.Sturdy and actually look real good.Beautiful and well made suit.Needed to be altered.Great shoes for the price I paid, I just wish the material was a little softer and less stiff.Easy to walk in and mfortableGood for high archThese are super cute earrings and I can't wait to give them to my daughter for Christmas because she loves Minnie Mouse.The only mplaint I have is for the price I paid, I expected a little bit better quality.These shorts are well made and are a great fit.I am not saying these shoes aren't mfortable, they are but not as mfortable as the other sandals.The strappy casual style of the sandals can be paired up with shorts, palazzo pants or casual dresses.I would like to see if you have one with a warm lining inside and no elastic on the bottom.Perfect for long term wear.The ball can be difficult to screw on but nothing a little determination can't fix.Must wear shape wear and a push up bra with this, its not forgiving at all.plunging neckline but i added a safety pin and worked fine.Prime shipping, great price, lovely dress.But for it was an excellent purchaseThis does not bother me, as empire waists are good for hiding a bit of tummy.Good quality, nice fit and holds up after numerous washes.great bra for the priceThe beads are much bigger than I expected, but I still love the bracelet, and have been wearing it for a uple weeks nowThe fabric is of reasonable thickness.If you do not have natural curves, this garment will not help you.Material is ok, not great.Looks great, very playful skirt.This is the perfect mix.This woven pattern is a subtle classic style and will look great with whatever outfit you are wearing at the time.The inner lining is very nice, the fabric is strong but elegant.It's light and flow-yThe fabric is light and it is see through so you need to wear a tank top underneath.The material is very shiny and it has a built in slip.For the price, this is one of the most mfortable thong underwear I've worn.But, you know chinese manufacturing standards can be virtually nonexistant in cheap production products so it worked well for me.Wish the material was a bit different but still love itIt a great jacket for oler spring or fall.Wore in the summer and and kept well through washes.I was looking for a slimmer wallet than the bi-fold, traditional one I had been using, and this one has worked perfectly so far.The only minor mplaint is that it scratches easily, if you put it in the same pocket as your keys or phone.Very good quality material but order a size bigger because it does run a little small.Although a bit snug, the cap was beautifully crocheted ) absolutely cuteThe v-cut is slightly off-centered, but it's otherwise a very soft, flattering, very mfortable dress.I wouldn't feel mfortable wearing these to work, but casual outings with this bra would be fine and mfortableI'm mostly happy with my purchase, thoughBeautiful and very good quality.Lots of great zipper pockets.Nice and exactly what I was looking for.Bought for a teenager and she loved them, the post was thicker than usual, but they look greatIt is still too hot to wear it but he has tried it on and fits nice.But the dryer took care of that.Very nice top.It's a replacement ring for my daughter her first one broke, and she loved it so had to get a new one.Loved the fabric and all the useful pockets.Required more training of the fabric than expected however.Good value all around.It's perfect and stylishFeels a little on the cheaper side but good nsidering the price.Fits well, but turns my hands and skin black from the dye.Here in the south I think I'd like it better if the blend had a bit more tton.The fabric is nice and soft and they are just as advertised.Everything else in the pack worked well in the sand.I'm a huge nautical fan.Infact rooms in my home have a nautical theme.Other then that I love the bracelet.Sounds easy, but it doesn't just peel right off.This robe is perfectly lovely.The material is really soft and the design very pretty.Also the dress shape and the fabric is amazing.Other than that, they wash well, are made of a soft fabric and look fantasticMaterial is scratchy polyester not soft tton like the red one I got last year.Quality of material is a touch off putting.But belt worked for my purpose and was an OK design.I love the look an feel of the underware.Good quality and fit as expected.Comfortable during a workout.Its a little loose but it looks really good.With that in mind, it should be nsidered that the velvet llects all kinds of different lored lints".As such, when you plan on wearing it, make sure that you have a lint roller handy.The inside of the material is not all that mfortable either, so keep that in mind.It's a great stume though and does look quite sexy, just make sure you order much bigger than you normally would, keep a lint roller handy, and remember to make it mfortable for you too.Unsure if they are organic tton as no labeling can nfirm, but daughter loves them.For the price the vest and bow tie are well made.They look great on our charm bracelets and have held up well.i needed a pair of easy slip ons for the summer that i uld mmute on the subway in and change out of when I got to work.so these were a great alternative.These aren't the highest quality shoes but they're great for the purpose they serve and the price.They are so soft and lightweight I love them.Great shine.Love these rings.The rings are tagged and wrapped individually.Since it is % polyester it is more loose fitting so remember that when buying.Its a beautiful dress.Love the material, they are so soft.It's a nice, thin, and mfortable material.NICE PRODUCT.The material and lors are very nice.Very mfortable to wear all dayAgain, leather-look...fit the bill.I love the material, so mfortableit's just in the middle and feels perfect.. Not a because of the fabric used isn't the best.Great top for the priceThey were soft and felt good to wear around very light.how ever the dress is not strechy and the outside is like a fuzzy material but no bother its still a good dress.absolutely perfection.Unfortunately the straps nears the wedge fell apart and the material on the wedge scuffs up and tears pretty bad but other than that, it's a great shoe.I love these shirts.Super mfy and great price.This bracelet is lovely.I would prefer a snap closure on leather bracelets.But, the quality is good, and it sits well on the wrist.These look great, but they are not mfortable enough for all-day wear.It was beautifulGorgeous, great proportions, beautiful details.Perfect so farI am ' and it is a little long and a little baggy on me; my first thought was that I had purchased pajamas.I won't wear it to work, but I will wear it out on fall weekendsThe product itself is very stretchy and mfortable so I'm honestly satisfied with the product itself, so I'm taking one star off for the error in the size chart.I was excited when it arrived, it is very cute, just like the picture, and is soft organic tton.Very well made of heavy metal.Looks great on my Civil war Lewis.Cute fits good but didn't expect it to be the material it was...thought it would be not as shinyFeels super lightweight which I like.Nice weight, great spin action, nice length.It hangs beautifully and I wear the shirt, the shirt doesn't wear me.It was everything it claimed to be, and I received a lot better quality for the amount than I expectedI'm on my way now to see if I can find some more Allegra brand shirts because I loved the quality so much.Great quality,fits as expectedA nice little necklace/bracelet that tries to emulate the Chakras.Very cute and airy thoughQuality is on par with price.It's quite padded and has an underwire for support.I love how it fits, great material, mfortable, great valueBeyond that, the quality of the pant is good.Perfect accessory for my pregnant wife.received as indicated and quality was as expected.The lens is very dark and I think they will serve the purpose that we need them for.If you have been to a D movie and used the glasses they provide, that is what they are like.You have to look closely to see serve and protect wording.quality is OK.Can get a little sore if you have it where flesh is thicker for a long time but that's just the nature of the beast.I really liked the material.Glasses meet expectationsThey are super mfortable too.Nice at, a little warm for San Francis but.......it has a removable liningOnly other thing I say is there was a smell to the top but a quick wash in the gentle cycle and air dry and it was fineThis is a gorgeous top.The material is thin and flowy, a flattering look on any body type.It is sparkly for surePerfect when baby is learning to stand and starting to walk.I like the height, and the gel on the heel for non slippage is ol.Cute little hat, light weight, pretty and easy to wearPretty wonderful pair of bootsPerfect for warmer days and the lors are soft in hue.Nice, light Great boxer briefs.Cheap yet mfortable.But other than that, it is stylish and blocks the sun well.It has also survived one machine wash on the gentle cycle.This is mfortable and ol to sleep in.I sewed in new ribbon and it was fine.It's super warm, definitely worth the money.Loosened all the way up, they are quite mfy.The clips are sturdy and have held up well over months of use.The sunglasses were still perfectly fine, no scratches, etc.The ring is a gift and am thinking about buying one for myself.It's pretty but the stones were lighter than the pic.Very cute and nicely madeNice craftsmanshipnice and mfyIt's a bit thick, but works fine as a replacement.It looks great, just can't be worn.Sexy though, and mfortable for the most part.Very cute the material is thick.The dress came a few days earlier than expected and it beautifulIt is long but will work fine with heels.Nice for the money not lined so perfect for summerNice quality and style but runs bigThe balance to the force.Good qualities easy useHowever, they do take a long time to dry on the line/ in the sun.Its also nice that they have the side snaps to my taking off easier.The dress is mfortable, and I would remmend.Think material with a great liner.Unlike cheap glasses which are usually light weight.These feel like quality glasses with good hard plastic.Great shine to them and clean lensThe packaging was nice.And the leather is extremely soft, no break in needed.Purchased as a gift for grand son.I love and have had no problems with redness or infection.I love the crochet style and stretch.It would have been perfect.This was a good nose ring, a hundred times better than those you would purchase at places like hot topic or spencers.Otherwise very nicely made.The bow is leather like but much more mfortable and is somewhat adjustable so that it's not too tight around the neck.No problems with quality.The lor is great and they're still mfortable.work as designed.This underwear feels great and has plenty of air circulation because of the material it is made with.It is not made with tton.More of an elastic material.Other than that great underwearIt's warm and mfySturdy but not too heavy.But still perfectly fine in.But the strings are too long and some of them are tied together like they weren't long enough The arms are the right lengths and it goes to about right under my knee overall it's very prettyFor inexpensive pajamas, these are nice.Nice belt, good looking, appears to be of good quality, but only time will tell, so stars for now and if it holds up to test of time, will update review.Love the design and material, wish it had more storage pockets but other than that i love it.The quality is decent for the price and they seem mfortable on their feet.Falls off the baby'baby's shoulders.It is a beautiful piece and I'm very happy with the quality of the ring.while it's not natural material, it still feels all right and definitely mplements the outfits intended.the quality was a little less than I expected but ol top definitely a crop top your belly is out.I loved how soft and delicate the lace material was.I do not regret my purchase, especially nsidering the excellent price.very mfortable, good support, and looks great.I like that they are not too thick or too sheer.They are about the same thickness as regular cable tights.They uld also uld be made from a softer, more natural material.Price wise, they are perfect.it is a wallet of good material.Great for the st.Very soft too~I love pugs and can never turn down the opportunity for a low st ankle sock to add to my llection.They are very cute and perfect for the price.They get the soft feel after the first wash.The front sarong adds modesty, but does not get in the way during water aerobics like a skirt does.The shirt is very thin so only good for layering.But will wear again, kept me warm in the ld rain last year.These are nice pants, very soft.Great for work and mfortable tooGot a little tarnish, but overall a good product.Loose, stretchy material, not as form fitting as I'd expected.Cute and mfy dress though.these would have been perfect if the had better ventingFabric and design are really cute.Not leather some kind of fake leather but it will hold up as an every other day belt and the design is as shown.Decent work pants.Carhartt makes a few different pants some seem a bit more heavy duty but these are good late fall early spring pants for the job sight.Very ol design and I was pleased with everything I ordered for the price.I can tell the quality of the hoodie is not the greatest.Inserts are certainly cheaper than a new pair of athletic shoesI feel that in the future it might break, children are not usually gentle on their items.Otherwise very good quality.Which baffles me if this is plus size.Nice ring with good size stones.If it were real rubies very few uld afford it.Cute graphic.Seems to be a quality shirtIt's a great tee shirtThese are gorgeous especially for the price.Nice ring bought for daughter she loves it that's all that really matters shipping was fast and came as picturedThis shirt is a great buy and at a great price.Cute mfy and inexpensive:)It seems durable enough bearing price in mind).The lors are vibrant and the rubber plastic is really easy to use to put on and take off of the phone.Nice little hat cute and interesting without being obnoxious Plus nfortable to wearEasy to adjust.nice breezy verup.I think the material is a little thin but again we all loved the shirt.From the pictures the beading looks silvery but the actual beads were gold toned.Just the skirt the lace at the top it's different from what I was thinking here's a picture for what I mean other then that I love Good hat not as thick as i thought the emblem is metal attached to the hat it is way to pricy for the quality will not but againNice quality, great fit.cute summer dress, but with lining, too much material for a verup.the chain that me with it is not to good but ever thing else is made very good.. my son loves itNice and sleek, son really likes itNot that attractive to wear, but neither is skin cancer.It does the job of protecting my face and neck from summer sun in addition to my sunscreen).Because of the crochet, it's not very easy to get on and off, but once its on, you're sure to feel nfident and get lots of mpliments.Good quality and mfortable.The top is VERY sheer.The material is cheap and slightly shiny, but I expected that from the price.Great sturdy material and I love the side snaps and the butt rufflesThe speaker is good and its durable as well, had it for a while, its great entertainment for campouts, and a nversation starter.Support cute.The bow wasn't secure and came off easy, but a little super glue and it was good as new.It looks good and you will not be disappointing.Not as warm on wood floors as I had hoped.The shirt is good Quality but it shrinks a lot after washing.However, I did feel the sparkle on it was on the cheaper side.....ok for a dinner on a cruise but not for a very elegant type of night.Nice just a little unmfortable.I need to lose some weight ........the dress is elegant.....these tanks are wonderful to wear all year long, alone, under clothing, as a pajama top.If you haven't worn clothing by Yala Bamboo, you're missing out on the softness and wash and wearability of great clothingIf I had noticed an option for a thicker material I would have went for that.Flexible and warm enough.Works perfect for a substitute wedding ring.But it worked out ok I gave it to my younger daughter.very pretty.She said it was very cute and well made.But overall a great product and great priceQUALITY: This dress' quality is so amazing.But the details are a little different.it is nice and shiny like the picture, feels so polished it almost feels slick.IF, IF this ring is the same stuff i expect it will be just as durable.i would have given stars but i don't know how scratch resistant it is yet.Material is not what I was expecting but they fit my newborn and have a decent amount of stretch so I'm sure they'll last awhile.very hotStays far allowing a lot of light in.mfortable too.Not as loose sleeves as it looks but still very niceCute for fun jewelry.Pearls are a little too oversized for my taste but it's a fun bracelet all the same.They are nice fit on the fingers and a great quality but they roll down.Other than that, beautiful quality and vivid lors.All in all, on the design and material.Purchased for a quick verup overtop of my bathing suit, I thinkit will do that job well.Lovely and the very item I was looking to purchase Though, I worry about damaging even just with regular wear since it's not sturdy enough to be put in a washer or dryer.The shoe itself is pretty ol and is holding up pretty good.I would prefer laces for older kids it's not too cute with all the straps.Material is very thin and I'm not sure if it's swim material but definitely very cuteThe same suit was more expensive on another siteSome stitching was ming loose when we opened the packet, but other than that it's very nice and fits well.But for the price and shipping time, it's fine for casual party use.It is perfectEasy to walk in and mfortable.Nice item nice price...my husband love it.It is a beautiful design.I love the style and ease.Hoping he puts a few pounds on before the wedding but soft material and shipped fast.This shirt is very soft and cute.Better material than I expected.Lots of toe room.High quality leather even the strapsthis is a nice one, better quality than the ofandyGreat shoes to protect kids feet from hot sand, or broken glass at the beachScarf pin was very nice.It is absolutely perfect.They have a lot of pockets which is nice.Quality is very good in terms of fabric.They look great and others have mplimented me on them.It is a beautiful piece but if you plan to put your iPhone plus there doesn't workHigh quality fabric fits my year old perfectly.I loved the see through crochet, but the down side it that it riped really fast, only after a few times of putting it on.Apart from that, it was nice to at least wear it a few times.I was very self nscience wearing to beach here in Chicago, but had a cktail and was fine.Just a little clunky looking but overall really nice.Also I really like that it came with an extra string of scrap turquoise beads, I was able to add a clasp and turn it into a simple bracelet.They look good, are sturdy and provide a nice, clear view.They are light weight but seem durable.Fantastic walletLove that dress, but had to return it due to printing.Good baseball socks.Good elasticity.Padding is great, good quality.The only thing that was detracting was it needs a little more stretch.Nice and warm tooI love this jumpsuitThis is cute and mfortable.This washes nicelyThe leash is softer than I thought it would be and the perfect lor pink.Very well made and perfect for my dog who likes to pull.Love the earringsI loved this wig and received so many mplimentsGreat hats, tight around the ears which I need, uld afford to be a bit longer in the back though.Nice and affordable, didn't take too long to ship/arrive but there is one downside hence the stars instead of ).There was excellent mmunication about the sizing from the beginning.My ears are old so they hung down a little in the back on my ears so I gave them to my daughter in law and she loves them.Beautiful and good quality.I hope its durable.They work greatHow ever the tool itself works great.It's a very fair price for this little tool.Nice and softThe material is thin and is made from an odd polyester blend, so it is slick and easily wrinkled as noted in other reviews.The quality of the fabric is ok but no the best.The lenses get scratched up very easily so be very careful about where you lay your sunglasses down.For a big guy, this watch is perfect, no adjustment necessary.Really cute and the shirt is nice and softLove the quality of this skirt.YES this shirt runs small as stated) BUT it's still a very good quality shirt.I gave them three starts because the design and cut is nice on a thin women.I love the detail of this.The quality is just fine.Nice product overallComfortable and durableGreat length and super mfy.I uld not say much, I bought it for a gift for my nephew, I saw it put and it fit very well, the material of good quality and well doneJust wish it had been a little bit better quality for the price but it's okayVery good for little ones who do not like slimy mud and sandPrice is great.Everyone needs a simple black skirt.You do need to be kinda careful, I don't see the light part lasting really long, but the shoe itself is cute and both my boys said they are mfy.Nice set of nipple rings.The buttons are very loose.It uld use a better strap, other than that it's pretty goodClean, simple.A bit heavy, but feels ok to wear all the time, which is what I was looking for.otherwise the quality is good.Was great product.It helps hold everything in causing less pulling and my incision and area around that is tender is less sensitive when wearing them.Otherwise love it.great beach bag.on the large side so great for towels and everything else.It's not overly long but doesn't show my

those of us with thicker thighsIt can work in a casual or career setting, bearing in mind the semi-sheer back.Very ol, but over heats and gets a little scratchy at times but that's ok.I don't care for the faux fur around the hood, but otherwise it is really nice.Much warmer than I was expecting when it first arrived.It has very nice detailing trim on the cuff and front placket.If it didn't have the

this nice loose dress for summer wear.It's made of a breathable fabric with plenty of room for movement.The only reason I gave it stars is that Peppa's ears curl forward at the first wash.

is a generous A-line cut.Well made productThere are a few threads out of place but when I tried it on it was nice and I wear a DD.My daughter has worn it several times and has been pleased with the

to stretch a bit the longer you wear it.Perfect for our DL trips.What a great idea AND it's executed magnificently.Service is great, product quality is, too.beautiful material and print, just wish it was longer, wider.The fabric used is on the lighter side, which is good for the summer.The latch seems strong.Little heavy but so mfortable.Soft and mfortableLoved the material and style.I got it to

into the material so at first it doesn't look like the best quality but it looks great onOverall they are mfortable and have what feels like an extra amount of material to help prevent chafing.After working out in these I do believe their a top brand to use when being active, but everyday use these are a little pricey to me.Perfect summer dress that is flowy and loose.Just didn't expect the fabric to be so loud and not soft.The scarves are nice, I do like them.I'm '" and it's short for me but I still love it.A bit too hot for summer I'd say but ok for the oler spring months.Very mfortable and quality is good.The waistband is stretchy, which I appreciate.For the Price it will work for the nightreally beautifulIt is a bit see-through in the top portion light-lored fabric area just because it is such a lightweight fabric, but looks fine with all white under garments.The stitching is well done.It is not as stiff of fabric/structure as some more formal suit Blazers but overall a nice looking atIncredible finish and awesome lor.I love the black interior and material.They ride up too quick when I wear them jogging, maybe just a bit quicker than those I have from other brands of booty shorts.Flattering fit.Good quality and fit, but not warm like the other ones."Nice stum but I didn't like it when I tried it onNot ALOT, but definitely enough for me not to be able to wear it in the water and not loose it.This Alpine Swiss Eva Brown Faux Shearling jacket is very light but it is very warmFits great and washes nice.This is a cute skirt.I'm trying to figure out a good

better than MyPakage underwear's version but they have softer material over all.The only innvenience is that the black one came a little scratched, with some silver showing, other than that its perfect.Seems like a quality watch.Perfect for after my csection.The only thing I will say is the bow really isn't needed, it's kind of unnecessary and it is more of a dull dark gold, wish it was more of a shiny, bright goldI like how the fabric feels.Lightweight flowing material that drapes your body.At first it was kind of unmfortable, but once it was broken in a bit it has been fine.I find it to be more mfortable than the original siline bands, though it's a matter of preference in this respect.Ironically the stiffness helps here even more, though it's mostly the use of two rings to hold it in place.I broke out the ruler and nfirmed in case it helps anyone: it is almost exactly mm.This was good quality.Comfy thoughI got this for my husband the quality of the shirt and screen printing are very good.Please make sure to never wash them because they do fall apart since it's only tied together.It was beautiful but not what I was looking for for the occasion.Good quality nice looking

a really beautiful winter sweater romper.On the occasion that my son wore it, he received many mpliments.The band itself is nice looking and seems solid for the price, and it did not take too long to arrive, it simply doesn't work for some Skagen mesh watches.I love the quality of the fabric doesn't get wrinkled easily and the fit is loose around the hip area perfect for the gym or as a layering piece under a sweater or shirt carelessly tucked in or relaxed look.I haven't washed it yet so we shall see.Oh I would definitely wear it for night out with denim skinny jeans or dressy

the dress.The deep neckline makes me look a lot taller and has an element of classiness infused with a sexy style.There is lace near the shoulder that I didn't see online and I love it.It is a good

my husband finds it very mfortableGreat belt for the price.It's exactly as detailed by sellerThe outfit is fine otherwise.They definitely seem to be more for fashion than function, but for the price

alignment, and you better be ready to weave all that togetherMaterial is thin but light and perfect for Florida heatThen again, TMI, but my nipples pop through a lot of things when I'm not wearing padding, so if you don't have that problem you probably will be just fine.If I adjust the top rrectly, there is no peep show though, so it just depends on the person and how their body is builtLove the look of this purse but after reading another review about the handle ming apart after one use I am determined to handle the purse with care and not to use it on a daily basis.I have used this purse once without any problems, but I was very careful with it too.Great bag so far.The wheels make it easy to maneuver.I gave it stars because I have not had it long and I wish the zipper had a little more flexibility when slightly over stuffed.They felt more durable so I was surprised.This top is absolutely beautiful.The only reason I gave it four stars instead of is that I'm not sure how well it will hold up after washing it a few times and that its a little shorter in the front than I would like.I am quite happy with this item.Great sunglasses to have and not expensive.very warmColor is accurate and product is represented well in the pictures and description.But its beautiful and i cant wait to wear itIs beautiful, but I thouth was bigerIt look great.I had to snip off a few loose yarns.This was great for revery after my csection.I only wore it a few hours a day for three weeks and it really helped support me, and helped my belly shrink.The fabric feels a little scratchy.good replacementAn unusually soft tton, it ironed up very well and looks good thrown over some leggings and a tee.Its lines are a little boxier than I'd ordinarily go for, but the length is good and the proportions of the shoulder against the length work just as well as I need it to.I love this necklaceIt is prettier in person than in the picture.It is nice but the top really needs a little support.These socks are very good for me because I referee basketball, and I need the extra mpressions to keep cramps away.Still the most mfortable sock I've ever worn.The fit of this dress was great, beading is gorgeous, and overall it is a good quality dress.Not so sure if it will make it through the washing machine in one piece, but for the price, you almost know that you are buying a semi-disposable dress and I'm okay with that.I love my fluffy, snowman pajamasIt's also quite warm maybe too warm for places with lots of heat).Very nice leather.Very mfortable slippers.They are soft and washable and look good and fit well.However, front side of bottom was not glued well and opened up after one month of use.Do not feel difference mpared to + shoes.A bit thin but perfect for a

fits well, doesn't get too big when it's wet.the neck mes up a little too high for my taste but all around good quality.It was very mfortable for a night out.It's soft and a nice shirt.This is a great quality belt.Although a bit more expensive than some of the others, it had a lot of great reviews so I decided to give it a shot.The belt is super soft and is easy to put on.My back pain is practically non-existent when I wear the belt, however it doesn't help my pelvic pain at all which is why I took one star off the rating.For some reason i expected this bralette to be made of soft lace fabric but it isn't.However it's still a great buy for the price because it looks amazing once on.They are not the top notch quality but for the price point I think they are greatThe st was a little more than similar slippers with shea butter and the effects of the lotion didn't last very long but the socks were mfortable and lorful.They me with a sturdy case and a wipe cloth.Only reason I didn't give it stars is because the lens seems a little thin and they need careful treatment when cleaning.Other than that great for the priceReally cute but marks up easilyThis dress seems well made,
